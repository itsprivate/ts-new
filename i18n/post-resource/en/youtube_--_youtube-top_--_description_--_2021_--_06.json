I was drivin' Impalas\nWe don't beef, if it's problems, we solve it\nI remember that D2 r–µvolver I bought for my partna\nHe died in a argum–µnt\nThey was hatin', that's why I'm way farther than 'em\n'Member askin' my mom where my father been at\nAin't no talkin', that fire what I'm tryna get at\nNiggas cuffin' these hoes that the crew done been had\nGet them racks out the bank, put it right in the bag\nSay he wouldn't do that, but he would if he can\nHop out marchin' with drums like we play in the band\nI come straight out the mud, I ain't been in no sand\nTwenty-hour flight, had popped me a Xan\nI got horny, almost fucked on a fan\nI had thinked about it, I can't end up on Shade Room\nEverything that I hit, I done paid for\nShe know what I can bring to the table\nI can tell if it's real by the label\nWe had TV, but we didn't have cable\nNow I'm richer than all of my neighbors\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lil Baby]\nI wear my chain proud, it's a trophy\nI'm with the same crowd, these the brodies\nI don't got the same mind, you don't know me\nYou don't gotta do it loud, keep it low-key\nI'm tryna be here for mine, I can't hold you\nThe Forgiatos twenty-four, this for Kobe\nI shouldn't have to say, you know that you owe me\nYou ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nHats off if you keepin' it real\nIt's so easy to fall victim to fake\nDurk the voice 'cause he know just what to say\nI'm the hero, I come through, save the day\nHats off if you keepin' it real\nIt's so easy to fall victim to fake\nDurk the voice 'cause he know just what to say\nI'm the hero, I come through, save the day\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Durk]\nBitch, I'm a D-boy, do it for T.Roy\nI'm on you forever, that's just word to V.Roy\nI'm with the killas forever, the trenches is in me\nThe Grammys can't change me for nothin'\nI like the bitches who let me just offer them cash\nYou never gon' ask me for nothin'\nNever gon' switch\nOnly time I ever switch is a Glock with a motherfuckin' button\nRappers be runnin' back, tellin' them bitches we hittin'\nThat's why we don't be tellin' them nothin'\n4TF, Only the Family\nBut Four Pockets Full, but we keep it a hundred\nThat shit solid, I done took losses\nI done turned robbers to killers and bosses\nI been that nigga from way, way back\nWay before Uzi was droppin' the cross\nWe just a family, we never recruitin'\nClique full of killas, we choosin' to shoot 'em\nSomeone tell Kanye and Kim to just stick to the script\nAnd just tell 'em to free Larry Hoover\nMe, I'm the voice, Baby, the hero\nTrav like Michael Jackson, yeah\nBeen in it a minute, it's crazy I'm winnin'\nIt only feel like I've been rappin' a year\nLet a nigga play with me, I'm ready\nMy bitch gettin' rich off cosmetics\nLife off, they done freed my daddy\nLights off, I couldn't see my baby\n2010, I had a gun in my Pelle\n2011, I was fightin' my celly\n2012, I signed my deal in Cali\n2021, I'm big as Khaled, oh-woah\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lil Baby]\nI wear my chain proud, it's a trophy\nI'm with the same crowd, these the brodies\nI don't got the same mind, you don't know me\nYou don't gotta do it loud, keep it low-key\nI'm tryna be here for mine, I can't hold you\nThe Forgiatos twenty-four, this for Kobe\nI shouldn't have to say, you know that you owe me\nYou ain't gotta search, you know that it's on me\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nHats off if you keepin' it real\nIt's so easy to fall victim to fake\nDurk the voice 'cause he know just what to say\nI'm the hero, I come through, save the day\nHats off if you keepin' it real\nIt's so easy to fall victim to fake\nDurk the voice 'cause he know just what to say\nI'm the hero, I come through, save the day\n\n[Verse 3: Travis Scott & Lil Durk]\n(Yeah) After this drop, then it's only a label\nYou see the crosses surroundin' the table\nBut never crosses, we flip ya, alfredo\nBro, do a solid without a potato\nI took the logic and built out a payroll\nAll the whips chocolate, I built it like Legos (Let's go)\nI leave him deceased (Yeah)\n\n....\n\n#LilBaby #LilDurk #HatsOff",

Clips used in the video are submitted by fans through our email and discord server. I spend over 12 hours per video editing to transform these clips into something that has never been seen before! There is also commentary from me that is included within the video for either added entertainment or to highlight something the audience may have missed out on without said commentary. My edits include creative subtitles, that we edit (it may go bigger or smaller based on the person‚Äôs speech or have some other kind of edit). Creative sound effects like cartoon effects when someone either falls from a high place, hits the ground, falls in lava, dies in the game, and much more. We include many memes in the video to make the video more entertaining for the viewer to watch as well as include many green screen effects to make the videos more comical and creative. We also spend time zooming in on peoples faces as well as zooming into certain parts of the video to highlight something the viewer may be missing out on if there were no zoom ins. We also manipulate audio or video in our clips to ensure there is no dead air for our viewers to watch. Over 50 clips are used in every video and we come up with a creative way to alter EVERY SINGLE clip to make it our own and UNIQUE to OUR channel. The majority of the unedited (or original) version of the clips I use can NOT be found anywhere else on YouTube. If you have any concerns or want a clip of yours removed, please send an email at GamersReactingYT@gmail.com\n\nRelated Videos to Enjoy\n\nsteveee - villagers will be unhappy xD\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgfXMR7aPE\n\nBionic - Minecraft, But There Are Custom Difficulties...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jMmBh-Rjic&t=6s&ab_channel=Bionic\n\nTapL - Minecraft, But Sleeping Gives OP Items...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpneREWXnXY&ab_channel=TapL\n\nMcYum - minecraft parkour be like\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdkE1dIRZFg&t=24s&ab_channel=McYumMcYumVerified",

  "data/youtube-top/2021/6/txCB6REY-1w.json": "Here's the follow-up montage video from the BlueTit nest box located in Loughborough, UK. It takes us from the first egg hatching to the chicks fledging and leaving the nest.\n\nIf you haven't seen the Empty Nest to First Egg video you can find it here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EPJEg6R3SM&list=PLG_1nW3IoL_OyETLTx_6aC6CjIbl7jAiw&index=2\n\nAs you'll see, several of the chicks didn't survive to fledging. There was a cold snap during the nesting period which could have had a bearing on the matter. Rest assured that the bird feeders were (and still are) well stocked. Like minded people with bluetit nest boxes in the UK left comments saying many of their chicks also hadn't survived through to fledging this year either.\nThe chicks hatched over a four day period, usually this would only be a two day affair. The final chick to hatch on day 4 didn't stand much of a chance compared to its siblings which were already much larger after 2 or 3 days of being fed. \n\nThe sharper eyed amongst you might have noticed that there isn't a day 15 or 19 in the video. This was due to a recording failure and a computer meltdown. The camera and computer had been streaming 24/7 for two and a half months and started to fight back!\n\nThe parents continue to feed the chicks in and around the garden and the chicks have not returned to the nest box. This is absolutely normal. \nThe white fluff in the nest is Sheep's wool.\n\nIf you would like to see more then there are individual daily highlights available! Please look through this playlist -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG_1nW3IoL_OyETLTx_6aC6CjIbl7jAiw\n\nThanks lots for watching - hope you enjoyed it!\n\nThings used to make these videos:\n\nNest box - Garden Nature side view box\nIn box Camera - Green Feathers wired IP camera \nExternal Camera - Sony A6400 with 18 -105mm F4 lens\nStreaming software - OBS\nStreaming hardware - Apple MacBook Pro 15\" 2012 and 2018\nEditing software - Davinci Resolve 17",

I've had so many silent personal struggles, public feuds and ALOT of mental trauma. Caused by ME, my past actions and people from my past. I've had TOO MUCH loss and have been slowly healing.\n\nIt's time to also say goodbye to California for awhile.. I'm selling my giant house in LA, I've donated and sold all my clothes and I'm starting the next chapter of my life. Please listen with an open heart and mind. Thank you to everyone who has stood by me through all the success AND the ugly. I love you so much. If you are struggling with mental health issues or depression, NEVER feel ashamed to ask for help.

(please don't actually show the channels just show avengers rolling their eyes or something) I even watched one where they said it could be her and then started using she pronouns for the rest of the video. What the bloody hell is wrong with ya, we're never getting early access again. (show video of someone slapping someone else over the head) All that for a drop of clout (show thanos saying all that for a drop of blood)\n\nAnyway from this point out I'm going in as blind as you guys and Daredevil and the episode has a lot to unpack from it.\n\nNow we open in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in the year 1985 at a renaissance fair.\n\n1985 is the year that Back To The Future was set similar to that film we get an adventure that involves our heroes travelling to the past and future.\n\nI love how they have this idea here of people dressing up like the past in an attempt to relive it. The TVA are literally able to do this and appear at any point in time and there's some really cool easter eggs at this location.\n\nFirstly we can see the Dragonfly armoury which could be a nod to Dragonfly an armoured character from the Marvel Universe.\n\nNext we get what I think is a cameo of Agatha Harkness. Before the big reveal in Wandavision that it was Agatha All Along we noticed that Agnes never really flinched when Wanda performed magic in front of her and this was because stuff like that didn't surprise the character.\n\nThe TVA step out of a temporal doorway in front of her here but rather than being shocked at that she's annoyed that they aren't dressed in traditional medieval attire. Agatha is however and it looks similar in style to what she wore in Salem. Agatha of course was alive during the time period that this festival is celebrating so I think it's hilarious that she's gone to one just to feel more at home.\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",

However beyond that in the comics it's a purple planet that we end up visiting in this episode.\n\nWe open with the song Demons by Haley Kiyoko because...well we're dealing with horned gods. They also encounter a woman who calls them devils and devil imagery has of course been laced throughout the show.\n\nFrom here we jump to Sasha Lane's C-20 and Slyvie getting their drink on discussing brain freeze. Hilariously Sylvie doesn't suffer from this as we know that Loki is of course a frost giant and therefore wouldn't feel the cold.\n\nThroughout our breakdowns we've discussed how there may be other characters making cameo's as slight variants and in episode 1 it was of course Peggy Carter, Episode 2 had Agatha and shoutouts Christopher Godines on twitter for pointing out we get what might be a cameo of Evan Peter's in this bar.\n\nReality warps around them as we see Sylvie attempt to get to the bottom of how many people are guarding the timekeepers which is revealed to be an illusion. Turns out this entire scenario is a pyshic projection which is actually another power that the Enchantress has.\n\nCut to the title screen and shoutouts Patrick Currier for pointing out that this is actually an effect that you get when you photocopy something over and over again. This is known as Generation Loss and over time if you keep copying something the quality of it diminishes. Obviously, this speaks to the amount of variant Lokis that there are running around and at one point in the entry Loki even refers to Sylvie as a failed Photocopy.\n\nFrom Sylvie travels to the TVA headquarters but she's surprised to learn that her powers don't work meaning that she likely hasn't been there before or if she has that she wasn't in a position to use them. Interestingly though Loki is able to warp his daggers in and this could be because he ended up being placed in a trusted position by the TVA.\n\nNow this power set is very similar to Wanda who too did something similar to people when she infected their mind in age of ultron. This is clearly the skill set of a witch and there are things that hint to her being more of a combination of characters early on.\n\nLoki asks if she's sure she's a Loki, she says not to call her that and at one point he even utters the line Enchant me which....\n\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",

Rising filmmaker Nia DaCosta (Little Woods) directs this contemporary incarnation of the cult classic.  \n\nFor as long as residents can remember, the housing projects of Chicago‚Äôs Cabrini Green neighborhood were terrorized by a word-of-mouth ghost story about a supernatural killer with a hook for a hand, easily summoned by those daring to repeat his name five times into a mirror. In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; HBO‚Äôs Watchmen, Us) and his girlfriend, gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris; If Beale Street Could Talk, The Photograph), move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials.\n\nWith Anthony‚Äôs painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini Green old-timer (Colman Domingo; HBO‚Äôs Euphoria, Assassination Nation) exposes Anthony to the tragically horrific nature of the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifying wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny.\n\nUniversal Pictures presents, from Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures and Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld‚Äôs Monkeypaw Productions, in association with BRON Creative, Candyman. Candyman is directed by DaCosta, and is produced by Ian Cooper (Us), Rosenfeld and Peele. The screenplay is by Peele & Rosenfeld and DaCosta. The film is based on the 1992 film Candyman, written by Bernard Rose, and the short story ‚ÄúThe Forbidden‚Äù by Clive Barker. The film‚Äôs executive producers are David Kern, Aaron L. Gilbert and Jason Cloth.",

Like, \"my dog pick my outfit\" or \"letting my cat choose my makeup.\" WELL. Of course I didn't manage to jump onto that trend WHILE it was..ya know...TRENDING. BUT. I'm here now, awkwardly a year later and ready to give this a try üòÇ \nSO, I decided to let my cat Opie choose my art supplies or pick out what I am painting in this video. I let him have several options including painting on squishies, painting a canvas, painting on a leather backpack and we shall see which one he picks. Hopefully you enjoy what I end up customizing and decorating today!\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 26 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here.

Croatia are gifted the lead in bizarre circumstances after a Pedri back-pass is missed by Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon. Spain equalizes before half-time through Pablo Sarabia after a scramble in the penalty area. Luis Enrique‚Äôs side takes the lead after Cesar Azpilicueta scores his first international goal in the 57th minute. Ferran Torres later adds to Spain‚Äôs advantage, before Mislav Orsic and Mario Pasalic score two late goals to send the game to extra time. However, Alvaro Morata and Mikel Oyarzabal secure the win for Spain with two goals in quick succession to send their side to the quarterfinals.\n\n‚úî Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n‚úî Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",

Haris Seferovic gave Switzerland a surprise lead, before Hugo Lloris prevented France from falling further behind with a penalty save. Karim Benzema struck twice and Paul Pogba curled in an incredible goal from distance to put France 3-1 up, but Switzerland found the net twice in the last ten minutes to force extra time. After no goals in the extra 30 minutes, Kylian Mbappe missed the decisive spot kick to send France home and Switzerland through to the last eight.\n\n‚úî Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n‚úî Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",
