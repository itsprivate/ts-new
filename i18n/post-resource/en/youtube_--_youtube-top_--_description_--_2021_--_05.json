  "data/youtube-top/2021/5/z9eoubnO-pE.json": "As early as Wednesday, May 5, the SpaceX team will attempt a high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 15 (SN15) ‚Äì our fifth high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from Starbase in Texas. SN15 has vehicle improvements across structures, avionics and software, and the engines that will allow more speed and efficiency throughout production and flight: specifically, a new enhanced avionics suite, updated propellant architecture in the aft skirt, and a new Raptor engine design and configuration. \n\nSimilar to previous high-altitude flight tests of Starship, SN15 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee ‚Äì approximately 10 km in altitude. SN15 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.\n  \nThe Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship‚Äôs attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN15‚Äôs Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. \n\nA controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  \n\nGiven the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX‚Äôs fifth high-altitude flight test of Starship!",

I was bad at everything I did. I also talk about how I'm really bad at golf, but I am kind of thinking listening back to it that you kinda had to be there for that one. I think I've come a long way when it comes to making these videos but oof sometimes I just fall right on my face when it comes to telling stories. But it's all about improvement right? I'll just do better next time :)\n\n\nI find that I am not really big into competitive stuff. Sports being one thing, but video games too. I like more casual games like minecraft. I used to be big into league of legends, but haven't played in years. It was so toxic, so now I just play block game :) and make block house.\n\n\nthanks for watching ‚ù§Ô∏è hope you liked it.\n\n(new merch is happening so I won't plug what I have now)\nüì± twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\nüì∑ instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/\n\nDISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

  "data/youtube-top/2021/5/EIj7ah_prEY.json": "Floyd Mayweather Breaks His Silence About The Jake Paul Fight\n\nFloyd Mayweather and jake paul got into a little bit of a brawl, but Floyd has been silent about the situation until now. Floyd and Jake actually used to be friends a few years back. Jake was getting ready for his first ever boxing match against popular YouTuber Deji, KSIs brother. Floyd said that he was Jakes trainer and that he supports him all the way.\n\nWell it seems that things have changed since then. Somehow Jakes brother Logan Paul is making history by entering the ring with Floyd Mayweather on June 6th. So if Floyd is logans enemy that means that Jake also has to support him. Even though the match between the two is for entertainment purposes, it is still important to create hype before the fight in order to sell more tickets. I think its safe to say neither Floyd or Logan would be entering the ring if they didn't make enough money for it. So they have to try and sell the match every way possible. And thats where jake pauls first argument with Floyd comes into play. Jake was next to the stage during the first face to face press conference between Floyd and logan paul. Well Floyd began saying that both the paul brothers are fake fighters and we all know Jake took offense to this because he considers himself a pro fighter after having being undefeated and taking down ben askren. So Jake Paul began to take things personally from Floyd. Although he never really said anything back to Floyd as it was logan chance to shine on the main stage..",

  "data/youtube-top/2021/5/6eykTvfB66c.json": "Olivia Rodrigo - deja vu (Live Performance) | Vevo LIFT\n\nShe played Paige and Nini, and fans loved her in both roles. But acting isn‚Äôt the only thing that Olivia Rodrigo is great at. When the ‚ÄòHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series‚Äô  star dropped her ‚Äúdrivers license‚Äù video back at the start of the year, the overwhelming response made it clear that she had a way of deeply communicating with listeners not only as an actor, but as an artist. Views-wise, it crossed the 200-million mark in just four months. Pretty impressive for someone who had never put out an album on her own. Rodrigo, who proved ‚Äúdrivers license‚Äù was no fluke when ‚Äúdeja vu‚Äù also hit a home run upon release last month, is fixing that. Her ‚ÄòSour‚Äô debut arrives on May 21, and by the time it gets here, she will have performed at both the BRIT Awards and Saturday Night Live. Billboard reports that the 18-year-old pop phenom is the ‚Äúfirst artist to send her first two proper singles straight into the Hot 100‚Äôs top 10.‚Äù The SoCal native, who wrote ‚Äúdriver‚Äôs license‚Äù with her pal Dan Nigro, recently told the press that she was obsessed with emotions, and loved her jobs as both actor and musician because they allow her to be so expressive. We‚Äôre thrilled that we got to work with Olivia on designing our exclusive LIFT content. A few weeks ago we hit the L.A., connected with Team Rodrigo, and came home with the kind of pieces that will give fans a revealing look into the singer‚Äôs personality, two unique performances and an exclusive interview portrait. First up is ‚Äúdeja vu,‚Äù and the setting couldn‚Äôt be any more fun.  ‚ÄúThese pieces look amazing on film,‚Äù says Rodrigo. ‚ÄúIt captures the tone of my work in a really powerful way.‚Äù  Hang tight, there‚Äôs more Olivia on the way.\n \nWatch the official video of \"deja vu\": https://youtu.be/cii6ruuycQA\n \nWatch Olivia Rodrigo videos: https://bit.ly/3eLiKRH\n \nFollow Olivia Rodrigo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OliviaRodrigoOfficial\nhttps://twitter.com/Olivia_Rodrigo\nhttps://www.instagram.com/oliviarodrigo\n \nVevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham\nDirector: Priya Minhas\nProducer: Maddy Schmidt\nDirector of Photography: Tehillah De Castro\nEditor: Kevin Rose\nMusic & Talent: Gabby Prisciandaro & David McTiernan\n\n#OliviaRodrigo  #OliviaRodrigoLive  #dejavu  #dejavuLive\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/vUL5rh",

This Friday Night Funkin' mod has an amazing song but when it came to the charting it felt more like a repeated spam similar to Ruv in Zavodila. I find the music gets pretty good near the middle and end which I choose the best skin mods for. My only complaint would be that some notes would often disappear for no reason. Once again I still want people to know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there.

Seafood prominently includes fish and shellfish. Shellfish include various species of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Historically, sea mammals such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent these days. Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia.\n\n\n-------Tags-------\nTalent Catching Fish,\neating seafood boil mukbang,\neating seafood boil no talking,\neating seafood boils,\neating seafood boil in a bag,\neating seafood boil king crab,\neating seafood boil with cheese,\neating seafood boil while pregnant,\neating seafood boil blindfolded,\neating seafood boil asmr,\neating seafood boil bloveslife,\neating seafood boil tae and lou,\nasmr eating seafood boil bloves sauce,\nasmr eating seafood boil blindfolded,\nasmr eating seafood boil beast mode,\nasmr eating seafood boil bloveslife,\nasmr eating seafood boil boki,\ncardi b eating seafood boil,\neating seafood boil chinese,\nasmr eating seafood boil compilation,\nseafood boil cooking and eating,\nasmr eating seafood boil with cheese,\nseafood boil eating challenge,\nasmr eating seafood boil king crab,\nseafood boil eating eggs,\neating seafood boil fast,\neating seafood boil for 24 hours,\nfirst time eating seafood boil,\nseafood boil mukbang eating fast,\nseafood boil asmr fast eating,\neating food seafood boil,\nseafood boil no talking eating fast,\nseafood boil eating with feet,\ngirl eating seafood boil,\nchinese girl eating seafood boil,\nasmr eating seafood boil hot cheetos,\neating with kim seafood boil,\nlady eating seafood boil,\nasmr eating seafood boil mukbang,\nseafood boil mukbang eating show,\nmessy eating seafood boil,\nseafood boil messing eating,\nseafood boil asmr messy eating,\nseafood boil making and eating,\nsas asmr eating seafood boil no talking,\nasmr eating seafood boil no talking,\nnikocado avocado eating seafood boil,\nasmr eating seafood boil octopus,\nseafood boil eating octopus,\neating spicy seafood boil octopus,\nasmr phan eating seafood boil,\nseafood boil eating pretty,\neating with que seafood boil,\nasmr eating seafood boil sas asmr,\nasmr eating seafood boils,\nasmr eating seafood boil spicy,\nseafood boil eating show,\nseafood boil speed eating,\neating seafood boil with cheese sauce,\nwoman eating seafood boil,eating seafood boil asmr,\neating seafood boil mukbang,\neating seafood boil no talking,\neating seafood boil king crab,\neating seafood boil in a bag,\neating seafood boil while pregnant,\neating seafood boil bloveslife,\neating seafood boil with cheese,\neating seafood boil tae and lou,\neating seafood boil blindfolded,\nasmr eating seafood boil bloves sauce,\nasmr eating seafood boil blindfolded,\nasmr eating seafood boil beast mode,\nasmr eating seafood boil bloveslife,\nasmr eating seafood boil boki,\ncardi b eating seafood boil,\neating seafood boil chinese,\nasmr eating seafood boil compilation,\nseafood boil cooking and eating,\nasmr eating seafood boil with cheese,\nseafood boil eating challenge,\nasmr eating seafood boil king crab,\nseafood boil eating eggs,\neating a seafood boil,\neating seafood boil fast,\neating seafood boil for 24 hours,\nfirst time eating seafood boil,\nseafood boil mukbang eating fast,\nseafood boil asmr fast eating,\neating food seafood boil,\nseafood boil no talking eating fast,\nseafood boil eating with feet,\ngirl eating seafood boil,\nchinese girl eating seafood boil,\nasmr eating seafood boil hot cheetos,\neating with kim seafood boil,\nlady eating seafood boil,\nasmr eating seafood boil mukbang,\nseafood boil mukbang eating show,\nmessy eating seafood boil,\nseafood boil messing eating,\nseafood boil asmr messy eating,\nseafood boil making and eating,\nasmr eating seafood boil no talking,\nsas asmr eating seafood boil no talking,\nnikocado avocado eating seafood boil,\nasmr eating seafood boil octopus,\nseafood boil eating octopus,\neating spicy seafood boil octopus,\nasmr phan eating seafood boil,\nseafood boil eating pretty,\neating with que seafood boil,\neating seafood boils,\nasmr eating seafood boil sas asmr,\nasmr eating seafood boils,\nasmr eating seafood boil spicy,\nseafood boil eating show,\nseafood boil speed eating,\neating seafood boil with cheese sauce,\nwoman eating seafood boil,\neating with candoos seafood boil,catch big eel fish,\nbig eel catch and cook,\nhow to catch big eel,\nhow to catch big eel fish,",

You don't every get in your car without knowing you destination and I treat life that way. LETS FUCKING WORK. This is the INDEPENDENT GRIND. Let's save the sad nigga hours for later. GIVE ME YOUR ENERGY! LETS FOOKING GRIND! WE ARE THE demigod glitch ;)",

In this Schlatt commentary video, Schlatt talks about stuff for a few minutes. Namely, Discord's new Logo. Yes, the Discord Redesign is bad and I don't like Discord's new logo. Discord is a bad company and I Will Never Buy Nitro Stop Asking Me. Even Jambo aka JCat aka Soup doesn't like corporate minimalism. He told me that the other night. Schlatt is upset by how brands ruin their perfectly good logos in favor of boring, lifeless, soulless Sans-Serif Wordmarks and flat design icons. \n\nGoDaddy, Petco, Discord, Smucker's, eBay, Pringles, and more companies with awful Logo Redesigns are talked about in this Funny Jschlatt Moment of a video. The Schlatt Ram Plushies are here and you should be buying them instead of reading this description. They are very well made and feel soft to the touch and I can't say that about most things.",
