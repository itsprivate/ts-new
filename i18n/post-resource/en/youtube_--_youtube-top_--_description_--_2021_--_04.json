Pictures’ superhero action adventure “The Suicide Squad,” featuring a collection of the most degenerate delinquents in the DC lineup.\n \nWelcome to hell—a.k.a. Belle Reve, the prison with the highest mortality rate in the US of A.  Where the worst Super-Villains are kept and where they will do anything to get out—even join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X.  Today’s do-or-die assignment?  Assemble a collection of cons, including Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2, Savant, King Shark, Blackguard, Javelin and everyone’s favorite psycho, Harley Quinn.  Then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese.  Trekking through a jungle teeming with militant adversaries and guerrilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave…and Amanda Waller’s government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement.  And as always, one wrong move and they’re dead (whether at the hands of their opponents, a teammate, or Waller herself).  If anyone’s laying down bets, the smart money is against them—all of them. \n \nThe film stars Margot Robbie (“Birds of Prey,” “Bombshell”), Idris Elba (“Avengers: Infinity War”), John Cena (upcoming HBO Max series “Peacemaker,” “Bumblebee”), Joel Kinnaman (“Suicide Squad”), Jai Courtney (the “Divergent” franchise), Peter Capaldi (“World War Z,” BBC’s “Doctor Who” ), David Dastmalchian (upcoming “Dune,” “Ant-Man and the Wasp”), Daniela Melchior (“Parque Mayer”), Michael Rooker (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films), Alice Braga (“Elysium”), Pete Davidson (“The King of Staten Island,” TV’s “Saturday Night Live”), Joaquín Cosio (“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” TV’s “Narcos: Mexico”), Juan Diego Botto (“The Europeans”), Storm Reid (“The Invisible Man,” “A Wrinkle in Time”, “Euphoria”), Nathan Fillion (“Guardians of the Galaxy,” TV’s “The Rookie”), Steve Agee (“Brightburn,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”), Sean Gunn (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, the “Avengers” films), Mayling Ng (“Wonder Woman”), Flula Borg (“Ralph Breaks the Internet”), Jennifer Holland (“Brightburn,” upcoming HBO Max series “Peacemaker”) and Tinashe Kajese (TV’s “Valor,” “The Inspectors”), with Sylvester Stallone (the “Rocky,” “Rambo” and “Expendables” franchises), and Viola Davis (“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” “Suicide Squad”).\n \nGunn (the “Guardian of the Galaxy” films) directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC.  The film is produced by Charles Roven and Peter Safran, with Zack Snyder, Deborah Snyder, Walter Hamada, Chantal Nong Vo, Nikolas Korda and Richard Suckle executive producing.\n \nGunn’s creative team includes director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”), production designer Beth Mickle (“Captain Marvel”), editors Fred Raskin (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood”) and Christian Wagner (the “Fast & Furious” films) and Oscar-nominated costume designer Judianna Makovsky (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2,” “Avengers: Endgame,” “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”).  The music is by John Murphy (“Kick-Ass”).\n \nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents An Atlas Entertainment/Peter Safran Production, A James Gunn Film, “The Suicide Squad.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.  It is set for release nationwide in theaters and IMAX on August 6, 2021 and will be available on HBO Max for 31 days from theatrical release.",

In theaters and streaming on HBO Max – July 16. #SpaceJamMovie \n\n-----------------\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SpaceJamMovie​\nhttps://www.instagram.com/SpaceJamMovie/​\nhttps://twitter.com/spacejammovie/​\n-----------------\n\nWelcome to the Jam!  NBA champion and global icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless Tune Bugs Bunny with the animated/live-action event “Space Jam: A New Legacy,” from director Malcolm D. Lee and an innovative filmmaking team including Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.  This transformational journey is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of professional basketball stars as you’ve never seen them before.  It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even “King” James by playing the game their own way.\nJames stars alongside Oscar nominee Don Cheadle (the “Avengers” films, “Hotel Rwanda”), Khris Davis (“Judas and the Black Messiah,” TV’s “Atlanta”), Sonequa Martin-Green (TV’s “The Walking Dead,” “Star Trek: Discovery”), newcomer Cedric Joe, Jeff Bergman (“Looney Tunes Cartoons”) and Eric Bauza (“Looney Tunes Cartoons”).\nLee (“Girls Trip,” “Night School”) directs from a screenplay by Juel Taylor & Tony Rettenmaier & Keenan Coogler & Terence Nance.  The film’s producers are Ryan Coogler, LeBron James, Maverick Carter and Duncan Henderson, and the executive producers are Sev Ohanian, Zinzi Coogler, Allison Abbate, Jesse Ehrman, Jamal Henderson, Spencer Beighley, Justin Lin, Terence Nance and Ivan Reitman.\nThe director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Salvatore Totino (“Spider-Man: Homecoming”), animation producer Troy Nethercott (“Wonder Park”), production designers Kevin Ishioka (“The Mule”), Akin McKenzie (Netflix’s “When They See Us”) and Clint Wallace (upcoming “Eternals”), editor Bob Ducsay (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” “Star Wars Episode VIII – The Last Jedi”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Rampage,” “War for the Planet of the Apes”).  The music is by Kris Bowers (“Greenbook,” Netflix’s “Bridgerton”).\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents a Proximity/The SpringHill Company Production, a Malcolm D. Lee Film, “Space Jam: A New Legacy.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.  It will be released in theaters nationwide on July 16, 2021 and will be available in the U.S. on HBO Max for 31 days from theatrical release.\n\nCredits not final / subject to change",

We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year!

Additional fee required.\n\nAcademy Award® winner Emma Stone (“La La Land”) stars in Disney’s “Cruella,” an all-new live-action feature film about the rebellious early days of one of cinemas most notorious – and notoriously fashionable – villains, the legendary Cruella de Vil. “Cruella,” which is set in 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution, follows a young grifter named Estella, a clever and creative girl determined to make a name for herself with her designs. She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar® winner Emma Thompson (“Howards End,” “Sense & Sensibility”). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella. \n \nDisney’s “Cruella” is directed by Craig Gillespie (“I Tonya”) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, story by Aline Brosh McKenna and Kelly Marcel & Steve Zissis. It was produced by Andrew Gunn (“Freaky Friday”), Marc Platt (“Mary Poppins Returns”) and Kristin Burr (“Christopher Robin”), with Emma Stone, Michelle Wright, Jared LeBoff and Glenn Close serving as executive producers. Two-time Oscar®- winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “A Room with a View”) creates the dazzling and imaginative costumes, which take on a life of their own.\n\nFor more information on “Cruella,” follow us on:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyCruellaDeVil \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/cruella  \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneycruella \nYouTube: https://youtube.com/disneymovietrailers​\nHashtag: #Cruella",

First, you have to get cobblestone to turn into pebbles. These can be thrown at mobs to stun them so you can mine them. After you mine three of a mob, you can turn them into a pickaxe. The chicken pickaxe lets you float to the ground instead of falling, while the sheep pickaxe drops wool everytime you mine. The villager pickaxe gives you Hero of the Village and amazing trades and the spider pickaxe even lets you climb walls. Of course, as you advance, you need stronger materials to stun mobs. While pebbles may work on passive mobs, coal is needed for neutral mobs, iron for hostile mobs, and even diamond for some of the strongest mobs. These stronger mobs include the Iron Golem, whose pickaxe launches whatever you attack, and the Ravager, whose pickaxe has a roar attack. Even the Ender Dragon can be turned into a pickaxe, which will mine any blocks you walk towards. Which pickaxe was your favorite?

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.

When Scott Ward (Dave Bautista), a former zombie war hero who’s now flipping burgers on the outskirts of the town he now calls home, is approached by casino boss Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada), it’s with the ultimate proposition: break into the zombie-infested quarantine zone to retrieve $200 million sitting in a vault beneath the strip before the city is nuked by the government in 32 hours. With little left to lose, Ward takes on the challenge, assembling a ragtag team of experts for the heist.

This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, the upcoming The Suicide Squad). \n\nF9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tbilisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  \n\nThe film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom’s past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  \n\nF9 is produced by Neal H.

He planned this all on his own, with some covert help from Brooklyn, family and friends. Bailey had no idea. What was your favorite part of the proposal?

I didn’t know it then, but I had just met my future husband! It took a year of him pursuing me, and me constantly putting him in the FRIEND ZONE, before I realized what a catch he really was! On Feb 25, 2017, Asa and I officially started dating, ending the day with my very first kiss! You can watch that video, HERE: https://youtu.be/FsI8KtveD3A (y’all prob know that story😉)\n\nIn the beginning of this proposal video, there is a small outtake taken when Brooklyn and I were filming our music video for Simple Things in May, 2017. In that moment, Brooklyn and my mom had put Asa up to the task of pranking me with a fake wedding ring and proposal! Little did I know then that four years later Asa would be the one to OFFICIALLY propose to me... and I wouldn't have it ANY. OTHER. WAY! \n\nAs Asa walked me out to where he planned to propose, I started bawling my eyes out when I figured out what was going on... I literally had NO clue! The date 4/3/21 will forever be a day to remember for the both of us.❤️ It might seem small to you, but it was like even the world was counting down for us! \n\nI’m so glad I got to say YES to my forever! (I’m still having a hard time remembering to call Asa my fiancé instead of boyfriend LOL!)\n\n💋's -Bailey\n\nPS~ Special thanks to Lizzy McAlpine for lending us the use of her unreleased music, to our friend Antoine for taking photos and video, and Kamri for editing this proposal video!

  "data/youtube-top/2021/4/uG5xcr1tphM.json": "Kate Middleton is one of 30 guests in attendance at Prince Philip's funeral, and appropriately, she donned an all-black outfit, designed by Roland Mouret, to mourn the royal family patriarch. Upon leaving for St. George's Chapel in Windsor, the Duchess of Cambridge was photographed wearing a black hat — complete with black netting — and face mask as well. Meanwhile, eagle-eyed royal watchers may have noticed Kate is also adorned in some familiar jewelry, which has a deep meaning for the family.\n\nIndeed, Prince William's wife was seen wearing the Queen's pearl necklace — which is said to be from her personal collection. This is not the first time Kate has worn the elegant piece, having also accessorized with the choker in 2017 at a birthday celebration for Margaret Thatcher, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nMeanwhile, someone else very special to both Kate and the royal family has also worn the pearl necklace in the past. But just who it is may surprise those who have followed the drama that has plagued the British royals for several decades.\n\nPrincess Diana, who was greatly at odds with the royal family almost from the start by all accounts, also wore Queen Elizabeth's Japanese pearl choker for a banquet in 1982, shortly after she married Prince Charles according to the Daily Mail. Of course, her mother-in-law at the time lent it to her for the occasion.\n\nNow, Kate wearing the storied pearls is a show of solidarity with Queen Elizabeth, according to Express. The Duchess of Cambridge put her own spin on the look, pairing the meaningful piece with diamond and pearl drop earrings, which according to Hello! are also from the monarch's personal collection.\n\nKate's outfit for the funeral ties her to Diana, and to the sovereign, on a solemn day commemorating the life of the longest serving consort in British history, Prince Philip, but it also makes a statement about health and family.\n\nWatch this video for how Kate's outfit for Philips funeral means more than you think! \n\n#RoyalFamily #PrincePhilip #KateMiddleton\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/385449/kate-middletons-outfit-for-prince-philips-funeral-has-a-deeper-meaning-than-you-think/",

This movie is actually set to show both events that happened between the snap and the blip as well as the aftermath of it, bringing us fully up to speed with the MCU.\n\nIf you cast your mind back to that movie you'll remember there was a big bit with Hawkeye in which he was taking down Mobsters in Tokyo. This arc is apparently gonna be expanded upon so we see that when half of all life in the universe was snapped away that many members of the Ten Rings came in and seized power. Though we might not see things from Hawkeyes perspective, we could see these mobsters potentially popping up in the movie, explaining certain parts in Endgame.\n\nIt's all connected!!!!\n\nNow as for The Mandarin, the film is going to be making him not only the leader of The Ten Rings but also the father of Shang-Chi. This differs slightly from the comic books as in those it was Fu Manchu who was his dad. However, Marvel came out and said that because he played on a lot of stereotypes that he's a bit of a problematic character and thus they've decided to combine both the Mandarin and Fu Manchu into well...the Mandarin.\n\nThis is something similar to what they did with Whiplash who was a combination of Crymson Dynamo and...well Whiplash.\n\nThere's actually a big article on Wikipedia that talks about the controversy that Fu Manchu has caused over the years such as his nonsensical name, the fact he's basically just a stereotype and also he said in a book once 'kill the white man and take his women.'\n\nPlayed by Tony Leung, Director Destin Daniel Cretton has said that they want to smash asian stereotypes and that they want the Mandarin to be the character to do this.\n\nSo yeah, Fu Manchu is about as popular as Armie Hammer is at a Vegan meet up and thus they've definitely done the right thing.\n\nAs for Shang-Chi, in the MCU he's been trained by his father in the ways of Martial arts since he was a child and the character has very much seen the ins and outs of the criminal organisation.\n\nIn the comics they've never out and out said exactly what his powers and abilities are and depending on what you read, very much depends on what you get. Though he has possessed them from time to time, on the whole, Shang-Chi tends\n\nHowever, Shang-Chi is a next level athlete that's often referred to as the greatest empty-handed fighter in the Marvel Universe. Move over Iron Fist you stupid chump, get the hell out of here.\n\nShang-Chi has mastered Chi and because of this he's able to push his body beyond the usual limitations that normal people face. He could basically do a trailer breakdown 20 minutes after a trailer releases which is almost as fast as me.\n\n\nMusic By Lakey Inspired\n» Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lakeyinspired\n» Spotify: https://goo.gl/aLkwM5\n» SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n» Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired/\n» SnapChat: Lakeyinspired",

Moreno – one of only three artists to be honored with Academy®, Emmy®, GRAMMY®, Tony® and Peabody Awards – also serves as one of the film’s executive producers.\n \nBringing together the best of both Broadway and Hollywood, the film’s creative team includes Kushner, who also serves as an executive producer; Tony Award® winner Justin Peck, who choreographed the musical numbers in the film; renowned Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor and GRAMMY Award® winner Gustavo Dudamel, who helmed the recording of the iconic score; Academy Award®-nominated composer and conductor David Newman (“Anastasia”), who arranged the score; Tony Award®-winning composer Jeanine Tesori (“Fun Home,” “Thoroughly Modern Millie”), who supervised the cast on vocals; and Grammy®-nominated music supervisor Matt Sullivan (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Chicago”), who served as executive music producer for the film. The film is produced by Spielberg, Academy Award®-nominated producer Kristie Macosko Krieger and Tony Award®-winning producer Kevin McCollum. “West Side Story” has been adapted for the screen from the original 1957 Broadway show, with book by Arthur Laurents, music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and concept, direction and choreography by Jerome Robbins. \n \nFrom 20th Century Studios, The Walt Disney Company will release “West Side Story” in U.S. theaters on December 10, 2021.\n \nTwitter:        @westsidemovie\nInstagram:   @westsidestorymovie\nFacebook     @westsidestory2021",

As expected, the helicopter flew out of its field of vision while completing a flight plan that took it 164 feet (50 meters) downrange of the landing spot. Keep watching, the helicopter will return to stick the landing. Top speed for today's flight was about 2 meters per second, or about 4.5 miles-per-hour.\n\nThe Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was built by JPL, which also manages this technology demonstration project for NASA Headquarters. It is supported by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, and Space Technology Mission Directorate. NASA’s Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance during Ingenuity’s development.\n\nA key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust). \n\nSubsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.\n\nThe Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.\n\nJPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover.\n\nFor more about Perseverance:\n-mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\n-nasa.gov/perseverance\n\nCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS",

Check out http://www.vox.com.\n\nFor the past several years scientists have been trying to account for the 8 million metric tonnes of plastic that we dump into the ocean each year. The assumption was that a large portion of it was floating out in one of the large garbage patches, where swirling debris accumulates thanks to ocean gyres. But recent measurements of the amount of trash in the patches fell far short of what’s thought to be out there. \n\nScientists are getting closer to an answer, which could help clean-up efforts and prevent further damage to marine life and ocean ecosystems. \n\nFor more reading, check out this New Yorker article on the missing plastic problem, which inspired this video: \nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/where-does-all-the-plastic-go\n\nLaurent Lebreton’s research that estimates the amount of debris in the garbage patches is here: \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w\n\nFor more about Ocean Conservancy’s work, and their annual international beach cleanup events: \nhttps://oceanconservancy.org/\n\nFor more reading about Erik Van Sebille’s work: \nhttp://erik.vansebille.com/\n\nFor more reading about Melanie Bergmann’s work: \nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226655/microplastics-laundry-wastewater-plastic-pollution-arctic-ocean\n\nWatch our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyE\nFollow Vox on Facebook: http://goo.gl/U2g06o\nOr Twitter: http://goo.gl/XFrZ5H",

Is it working?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nEarly in the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the world’s richest countries poured money into the race for a vaccine. Billions of dollars, from programs like the US’s Operation Warp Speed, funded development that brought us multiple Covid-19 vaccines in record time. But it also determined where those vaccines would go. Before vaccine doses had even hit the market, places like the US and the UK had bought up nearly the entire supply.\n\nThis turns out to be an old story. In nearly every modern global health crisis, from smallpox to malaria to H1N1, rich countries have bought up vital medical supplies, making poor countries wait sometimes decades for life-saving support. It’s effectively a system in which where you live determines whether you live or die of a preventable disease. Leaving a disease like Covid-19 to spread unchecked in some places also gives it a chance to mutate -- and variants of the virus are already raising alarms. So: how do we get vaccines to countries that can’t afford them?\n\nOne solution underway is called Covax. It’s a program co-led by the World Health Organization; Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Its goal is to get vaccines to lower- and middle-income countries at the same time as rich countries. So how is it supposed to do that? And will it be enough?\n\nMore from Vox.com’s Julia Belluz + Jen Kirby on Covax and vaccine nationalism:\nhttps://www.vox.com/21448719/covid-19-vaccine-covax-who-gavi-cepi\nhttps://www.vox.com/2021/2/24/22298981/ghana-vaccines-global-covax-initiative\nhttps://www.vox.com/2021/1/29/22253908/rich-countries-hoarding-covid-19-vaccines\n\nDuke Global Health Innovation Center data: https://launchandscalefaster.org/covid-19/vaccineprocurement\n\nMore on vaccine nationalism:\nhttps://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/campaigners-warn-9-out-10-people-poor-countries-are-set-miss-out-covid-19-vaccine\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/02/04/963741244/in-vaccine-race-middle-income-nations-are-at-a-disadvantage-just-ask-peru\n\nMore on the H1N1 pandemic:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864298/\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

She inherited her father’s love of flight, but not his sense of duty. Except in one regard. She swore to kill the man who’d sent her father to die: his Faction Leader, Kuben Blisk. But when the moment came to pull the trigger, she hesitated -- he spoke of Viper with respect. And he challenged her to be better. Valkyrie shot him anyway, but she didn’t take his life. Just his invitation card to the Apex Games.\n\nValkyrie’s jetpack – forged from the remnant’s of Viper’s Northstar Titan – allows her to fly above the battlefield for a limited time. When it’s time to swoop in for the kill, she can unleash a swarm of missiles to damage and disorient her enemy. And if things get too hot she can employ her Ultimate – which allows her and her entire squad the ability to quickly reposition and find the next fight. Valkyrie enters the games with something to prove and ready to rain death down from on high.\n\nThere’s nowhere to hide this season, Legends. Ready to find out if you’re predator or prey? Discover your true nature when Apex Legends – Legacy launches May 4!\n\nApex Legends™ is a free-to-play battle royale game where legendary characters battle for glory, fame, and fortune on the fringes of the Frontier.
