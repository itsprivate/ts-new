Speaking exclusively to TODAY, Richardson cites the pressure of athletic competition, her biological mother’s recent death and more, but says, “I know what I did, I know what I’m allowed to do … and I still made that decision.” Regarding the chance that she could still participate in a relay event, she says, “If I’m allowed to receive that blessing, then I’m grateful for it, but right now, I’m going to just focus on myself.” She says: “I’d like to say to my fans and my family and my sponsorship … I apologize,” adding, “Don’t judge me: I’m human. I just happen to run a little faster.” She adds: “I still have games in me … I’ll be back and ready to compete.”\n\n» Subscribe to TODAY: http://on.today.com/SubscribeToTODAY\n» Watch the latest from TODAY: http://bit.ly/LatestTODAY\n\nAbout: TODAY brings you the latest headlines and expert tips on money, health and parenting.

Ty Dolla $ign - safety net (Official Live Performance) | Vevo\n\nFor a singer, being able to set a mood is like being able to cast a spell. Time and again Ariana Grande has proven she's one of those vocalists who can architect an aura, and this performance of \"safety net\" is a great example of the way she controls the emotional climate of a song. The lyrics describe the feeling of being lost in love - a little bit over your head in a new relationship. By inviting Ty Dolla $ign along for a very smooth exchange of lines, Ari takes on an arranger's duties. She knows exactly how she wants this one to sound. \"safety net\" is from 'Positions,' of course. Like our previous Official Live Performance of \"pov,\" it puts her voice right up front, exactly where it should be. Deftly designing the use of swoops and trills, she again shows us her mastery of modern pop. Stay tuned, more coming.\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “safety net” by Ariana Grande.

This video is about the time I had appendicitis and was sent to the hospital where I got emergency surgery. This video actually had a due date (today) for the sponsor so there was a couple things that got left out of the story, they were tiny details but it was things like my friends came to visit me after my surgery and it was really nice! It meant a lot more than I expected it to. My friends were the real stars here and I don't think I did them real justice tbh so maybe another day I'll do a retelling of the story, podcast style or something. I might take a break from sponsors for a video or 2 so I don't run into this problem again. Also I'm getting worried the sponsorship reads are just funnier than the actual video lol.\n\n\nBut yeah the appendicitis thing. It was terrible. Especially getting sick all over the place. I remember that doctor looking at me and being like \"you need to stick this tube in your stomach\" and I was thinking I wasn't ready but didn't really have a choice. There was no room for push back it was all or nothing. It was a little freaky but I think I'm so lucky to have my friends in my life to support me. They were there to bring me to the hospital, support me emotionally, take care of my belongings when I abandoned them in the classroom.\n\n\nAlso I learned a lot about the hospitalization process. It's pretty fast like I was just given a room right away. One moment I was given an assessment and the next I was given a patient robe to put on, I hardly had time to think!\n\n\nTIME TO GET TO WORK ON THE NEXT VIDEO!\n\n\n\nthank you for watching ❤️\n\n(new merch is happening so I won't plug what I have now)\n📱 twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\n📷 instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/\n\nDISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

The Weeknd (Official Live Performance) | Vevo\n\nIf our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. The Weeknd showed up to assist his pal with the dreamy mood of “off the table.” As proven previously on tracks such as “Love Me Harder” and “Save Your Tears,” their chemistry is deep. The two stars glide through the song, helping each other reveal the nooks and crannies that are only obvious to accomplished musicians.\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “off the table” ft.

Pictures and Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name.\n\nA mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.\n\nThe film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,” “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep,” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”), Oscar Isaac (the “Star Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr. Long,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), David Dastmalchian (“Blade Runner 2049,” “The Dark Knight”), Sharon Duncan-Brewster (“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” Netflix’s “Sex Education”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).\n\nVilleneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Villeneuve and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert. Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter and Joe Caracciolo, Jr. The executive producers are Tanya Lapointe, Joshua Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert.\n\nBehind the scenes, Villeneuve reteamed with two-time Oscar-nominated production designer Patrice Vermette (“Arrival,” “Sicario,” “The Young Victoria”), two-time Oscar-nominated editor Joe Walker (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Arrival,” “12 Years a Slave”), two-time Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”). He also collaborated for the first time with Oscar-nominated director of photography Greig Fraser (“Lion,” “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”); three-time Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and costume designer Robert Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”). Oscar-winning and multiple Oscar-nominated composer Hans Zimmer (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Inception,” “Gladiator,” “The Lion King”) is creating the score.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present a Legendary Pictures Production, a Film by Denis Villeneuve, “Dune.” The film is slated to be released in select theaters in 2D and 3D and IMAX and on HBO Max on October 22, 2021 and will be available on HBO Max’s Ad-Free plan in 4K UHD, HDR10, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos (English Only) on supported devices for 31 days from theatrical release.\n\nThe film has been rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material.",

I love doing these challenges.\n\nThis video, my friends can one shot me in Minecraft. If they hit me at all, I die, and I lose. If I look at them, they are frozen with lazer beams on them. They can't move or hit me at all. They have to sneak up on me.\n\nIf this video gets 2,000,000 likes we'll do a rematch!\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.

Goodbye.\n\nJoin the Creative Weirdo family and subscribe!: http://bit.ly/mrkateyoutube and check out our amazing sponsor Shipt here: https://www.shipt.com/mrkate \n\nIn today's episode we are saying goodbye to so many things, our house and all of you. Change is scary and change is hard, but change is also powerful. We are excited to discover the next phase of our journey and we can't wait to share that with you. If you've been with us since the beginning you know how emotional it is to say goodbye to our first home we've lived in for 8 years and lovingly renovated. We put so much love and hard work into this DIY fixer upper and so it's sad to say goodbye to it, but we've grown out of it and are excited to explore the world to see what's next, and hopefully find our dream home. Thank you home for all you have done for us and thank you to all of you for following along on our journey. To all of you, we say goodbye as we take a little time off to renew our creativity so that we can come back to you with a refreshed and inspired perspective.\n\n*Alcohol delivery available from select retailers and selection varies by location.
