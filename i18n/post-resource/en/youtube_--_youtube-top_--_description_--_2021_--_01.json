We’ll be presenting Phish’s first New Year’s Eve show from Madison Square Garden — 12/31/95 — in its entirety, beginning at 8:30 pm ET.\n\nWe’ve teamed up with the fine folks at https://Chess.com to host the Band vs. Audience online chess game which will start right at the top of the show and move at a decent clip. In short, fans will have 5 minutes to move their piece (the band will have no more than that as well). At the end of 5 minutes, whichever move has the most votes is the ‘audience’ move. Stick around during the set breaks as the band joins in from their various homes, playing a few moves and providing scintillating commentary on the game. We will post and send out the actual game link on 12/31.\n\nTo pace yourself over a long evening, we present some chess cheese board recipes for extended grazing. Our friend Marissa Mullen put together two options — “Olive Cheese Dreams” and “Billy Bries” — with an easy ‘cheese by numbers’ guide. Feel free to swap out any of the ingredients if there’s something else you prefer. Pair with the bubbly of your choice. For dessert, chessboard cookies! Recipes can be found at https://livephi.sh/chessmenu\n\nFor this final webcast of the year, our beneficiary will be none other than The WaterWheel Foundation itself. Since 1997, the band and their fans have collaborated on a nationwide charitable endeavor by raising funds and donating the proceeds across the country. This year alone, collectively we have raised and donated nearly $750,000 to 27 different nonprofits during the Dinner And A Movie series. Join us in continuing to support those in need.

You can also come into a chair, or on the edge of your couch when we take this shape. That is a great way to modify and possibly a better spot for you to tune in, work with the breath technique, and warm up before we get moving into other shapes each day. \n\nFinally, set an intention. Be brave and ask WHY? Why are you here? What do you think pulled you here? And if you don’t know, that is okay, we will likely uncover that together.

That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!\n\nWonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions.

Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end?

Is it true? And if so: why? I ate a few bagels, and set out to flunk an opioid test.\n\n👇👇👇 SOURCES and REFERENCES 👇👇👇\nDrug tests don’t just work as a buzzkill, they can keep doctors and patients honest regarding some of the more dangerous drugs known to man. The problem is, poppy seeds can throw a giant wrench in that circle of trust! Poppy seeds come from the papaver somniferum flower native to Turkey, and even though they don’t contain opium, consuming the seeds has historically caused the tests to register opiate use!\n\nIn this video, I explore how these tests work, what they look for, and how something as simple as a bottle of seeds available at any grocery store, can cause a false positive for painkillers, heroin, morphine, and other drugs.\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica: Poppy Seed\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/poppy-seed\nhttps://www.britannica.com/story/can-eating-poppy-seeds-make-you-fail-a-drug-test \nPoppy seed, tiny dried seed of the opium poppy, used as food, food flavouring, and the source of poppy-seed oil. Poppy seeds have no narcotic properties, because the fluid contained in the bud that becomes opium is present only before the seeds are fully formed. The plant, Papaver somniferum, is an herbaceous annual native to Greece and the Orient. Poppy seed is an ancient spice; the seed capsules have been found in Switzerland in the remains of prehistoric lake dwellings.\n\nCan Eating Poppy Seeds Give You a Positive Drug Test?\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-nutrition/poppy-seeds-drug-test#bottom-line\nIt’s possible that even just one bagel or muffin highly loaded with poppy seeds can lead to a positive urine drug test.\n\nLabCorp: Testing Methodology\nhttps://www.labcorp.com/frequently-asked-questions/drug-testing/toxicology/testing-methodology#:~:text=LabCorp%20performs%20initial%20drug%20screening,drug%20present%20in%20urine%20samples. \nQuest Diagnostics: Testing Insights\nhttps://education.questdiagnostics.com/insights/88In \n\nDrugAbuse.gov\nhttps://archives.drugabuse.gov/blog/post/drug-testing-poppy-seeds#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%2020%20years,can%20indeed%20produce%20a%20positive\nDid you know that morphine, codeine, and heroin are produced from the seeds of certain kinds of poppy flowers? Morphine and codeine are often used as medications for treating pain, and all three—known as opiates—can be abused\n\nSnopes (true!)\nhttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/poppy-seeds-alter-drug-test-results/\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com/creator\nVideo supplied by Getty Images",

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I’ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.",

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. \n\n“Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.\n\n2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. \n\nWhat does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”.",

  "data/youtube-top/2021/1/-OXF89dozUI.json": "FORT WORTH, Texas - A North Texas man charged with participating the U.S. Capitol riot made his first appearance in court on Monday.\n\nLarry Brock is one of dozens of suspects the FBI identified from video and images taken inside the Capitol. Images from the riot show Brock inside the U.S. Senate chamber with white flex cuffs.\n\nCameras weren't allowed inside the federal courthouse in Fort Worth. The Monday hearing lasted just five minutes and Brock was escorted into the courtroom by two U.S Marshals.\n\nA judge determined Brock qualified for a court-appointed defense attorney. Brock was then ordered held in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until his probable cause and detention hearing scheduled for Thursday.\n\nA mug shot, released by the grapevine police department shortly afterward Monday’s appearance, shows how brock looked at the time of the brief hearing. His hands were cuffed in front of his black t-shirt and his legs shackled around his jeans.\n\nThe retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserves was identified by his ex-wife as the man photographed -- and captured on surveillance video wearing combat gear and items to potentially detain and arrest people on the senate floor during the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nThe arrest affidavit quoted Brock's ex-wife, who reportedly called the FBI National Threat Operations Center. She said, in part, \"I just know that when I saw this was happening I was afraid he would be there... It is such a good picture of him and I recognize his patch.\"\n\n\"There's a wealth of potential criminal offenses in addition to the 2 that they charged that would be available.\n\nRichard Roper is a former U.S Attorney for the Northern District of Texas not associated with the case and said video evidence will be key in prosecuting.\n\n\"It nails down the identity of the perpetrator,\" Roper said.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, filed in the District of Columbia, Brock is charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Both are federal charges.\n\n\"There's two charges, essentially a criminal trespass charge being in a place you’re not authorized to be,\" Roper said. \"Both of those charges, interestingly, are misdemeanor charges -- meaning punishment range would be less than one year in prison unless someone carries a dangerous weapon.\"\n\nBrock's defense attorney did not have any comment. But he did say after Thursday's hearing, the case will be turned over to the courts in D.C. since that is where the alleged crimes took place.\n\nFOX 4 News is a FOX-owned station serving Dallas-Fort Worth and all of North Texas.",

The film covers a subject matter that is extremely difficult to pull off from an artistic and technical standpoint. Nothing about the setting, characters or structure of this film was easy to do.

I knew to pull it off successfully would require a tremendous amount of time, effort and artistic know-how which I didn't feel confident I could do.\nIt wasn't until after finishing my previous and longest animated short film, \"Friendly Shadow\", that I finally felt that I was at the skill level required for this gigantic project.\nI'm not in love with all of it, but overall I think it definitely succeeded.

  "data/youtube-top/2021/1/WdVWba0VEkA.json": "Even though the setting is surely familiar, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are still surely getting used to actually living in their new White House digs. \n\nThere are big things to attend to, like a mountain of executive orders. And then there are the details: The family pictures in the Oval Office. What rugs will the Bidens want in their living quarters? What color curtains will they have? Where and how will President Biden store his mail?\n\nThe new commander in chief is getting a lot of correspondence already. Perhaps surprisingly, outgoing President Donald Trump left a note for the new chief executive. Maybe even more surprisingly, Biden said,\n\n\"The president wrote a very generous letter.\"\n\nThere's also the letter that Amazon sent to the newly inaugurated president, offering to assist with upcoming COVID vaccination drives. And there's the \"private message\" that Queen Elizabeth sent to Biden ahead of his January 20th inauguration, The Sunday Times reported. \n\nBiden has received messages from many of the world's leaders, as they offer their congratulations and their hope for a path forward in U.S. foreign policy. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in an interview with Sky News, said that the United States and the United Kingdom share a, quote, \"joint united agenda\" and that the new administration was \"a fantastic thing for America.\" Was the queen's message similar, perhaps?\n\nVanity Fair says that Queen Elizabeth's letter will remain as private as President Trump's letter to Biden presumably will. While we can't guess as to the content of the letter, we can bet that it was personalized. Joe Biden is the 14th president to lead the U.S. during Queen Elizabeth's reign. And, considering her history with the other 13 sitting U.S. presidents, it's certain that the two will meet in the next four years. Perhaps the message extended an invitation to Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.\n\nOr is it possible Joe and Jill Biden could pass the Balmoral Test? That's a very tentative maybe. According to Time, Queen Elizabeth has met with every U.S. president, with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson, since she became queen in February 1952. In that time, only President Eisenhower was invited to her summer home of Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nThis being said, Her Majesty is said to have been quite charmed by Barack Obama. Author Tom Quinn, who wrote Kensington Palace: An Intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle, claims the queen developed a soft spot for America after meeting the 44th president. If that's the case, perhaps Queen Elizabeth associates President Obama's former vice president, Joe Biden, with his old boss, which can only be good. Over eight years, the Obamas visited with the queen three times.\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth began her reign, Harry S. Truman was president of the United States. The two had actually met a few months before, in October 1951, when the queen was still a princess. In addition to sitting U.S. presidents, The Heritage Foundation notes that Her Majesty also met President Herbert Hoover, who was in office from 1929 to 1933, prior to becoming queen.\n\nThe Independent notes that Queen Elizabeth and President Joe Biden have not yet met, though some outlets report otherwise. It's possible they exchanged pleasantries during Biden's 36 years in the U.S. Senate, but while serving as vice president from 2009 to 2017, Biden did not travel with the Obamas on their three state visits to the U.K., and the queen last visited the United States in 2007, then the guest of President George W. Bush and Laura Bush. \n\nGiven all the rich history the queen has with America's leaders, it's not hard to imagine that her private message to President Biden was one of cordial friendship — even if the two have yet to meet. With COVID-19 restrictions still firmly in place around the world, a visit between Queen Elizabeth and the 46th U.S. president will no doubt be delayed, but it will happen. It's tradition, after all. \n\n#QueenElizabeth #JoeBiden #Inauguration\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/317367/heres-how-queen-elizabeth-responded-to-bidens-inauguration/",

Poirier proved that to be true in the rematch on Fight Island when he survived early blitzes from McGregor to score a shocking upset victory by second-round knockout.\n\nMcGregor came out fast, flashing his trademark speed and power, and even dipping back into the same shoulder strikes that led to the knockout of Donald Cerrone in his January 2020 return to the Octagon. Through it all, Poirier remained steady, working over McGregor with leg kicks, eventually taking the base of the Irish superstar before blitzing him with punches, dropping him to the canvas and scoring the knockout at the 2:32 mark of Round 2.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ\n \nFOLLOW US ON:\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports\n\n#UFC #McGregor #Poirier #ConorMcGregor #DustinPoirier #UFC257 #MMA",

Kong and his protectors undertake a perilous journey to find his true home, and with them is Jia, a young orphaned girl with whom he has formed a unique and powerful bond.  But they unexpectedly find themselves in the path of an enraged Godzilla, cutting a swath of destruction across the globe.  The epic clash between the two titans—instigated by unseen forces—is only the beginning of the mystery that lies deep within the core of the Earth.\n\nThe film stars Alexander Skarsgård (“Big Little Lies,” “The Little Drummer Girl”), Millie Bobby Brown (“Stranger Things”), Rebecca Hall (“Christine,” “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women”), Brian Tyree Henry (“Joker,” “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”), Shun Oguri (“Weathering with You”), Eiza González (“Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw”), Julian Dennison (“Deadpool 2”), with Kyle Chandler (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters”) and Demián Bichir (“The Nun,” “The Hateful Eight”).\nWingard (“The Guest,” “You’re Next”) directed from a screenplay by Eric Pearson (“Thor: Ragnarok”) and Max Borenstein (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” “Kong: Skull Island”), story by Terry Rossio (“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales”) and Michael Dougherty & Zach Shields (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters”), based on the character “Godzilla” owned and created by TOHO CO., LTD.  The film was produced by Mary Parent, Alex Garcia, Eric McLeod, Jon Jashni, Thomas Tull and Brian Rogers, with Jay Ashenfelter, Herbert W. Gains, Dan Lin, Roy Lee, Yoshimitsu Banno and Kenji Okuhira executive producing.\n\nThe director’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Ben Seresin (“The Mummy,” “World War Z”), production designers Owen Paterson (“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” “Godzilla”) and Thomas S. Hammock (“Blair Witch”), editor Josh Schaeffer (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters”), costume designer Ann Foley (“Skyscraper”) and visual effects supervisor John “DJ” DesJardin (upcoming “Zack Snyder’s Justice League”).\n\nWarner Bros.

But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well.\n\n“Raya and the Last Dragon” features an outstanding voice cast, including Kelly Marie Tran as the voice of the intrepid warrior Raya; Awkwafina as the legendary dragon, Sisu; Gemma Chan as Raya’s nemesis, Namaari; Daniel Dae Kim as Raya’s visionary father, Benja; Sandra Oh as Namaari’s powerful mother, Virana; Benedict Wong as Tong, a formidable giant; Izaac Wang as Boun, a 10-year-old entrepreneur; Thalia Tran as the mischievous toddler Little Noi; Alan Tudyk as Tuk Tuk, Raya’s best friend and trusty steed; Lucille Soong as Dang Hu, the leader of the land of Talon; Patti Harrison as the chief of the Tail land; and Ross Butler as chief of the Spine land.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/rayaandthelastdragon\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyRaya\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneyraya/\nHashtag: #DisneyRaya",

Instead of talking about the millionth false rumor to hit the internet, I'm exciting to unveil my custom one of a kind PINK Louis Vuitton monogram shoe trunk!!!!!!! Contrary to popular belief and slander, I don't money shame anyone and we all know I've come from literally NOTHING. I created glitter from dirt and will always be grateful for how far I've come. So when I sarcastically asked Louis Vuitton if they'd let me be the first customer to ever CHANGE the monogram color by request, I didn't expect them to respond. A few weeks went by and they said YESSSSSS! I was so shook, so I got to design and create some of my dream LV pieces in my very own Jeffree Star baby pink with white monogram!!!

  "data/youtube-top/2021/1/W5-yezpcZNU.json": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.\n\nMiley Cyrus has always understood that music is theater. So it's no surprise that, visiting the imaginative space that is the Tiny Desk, she transforms it into something both fantastical and true to her topsy-turvy Mileyness.\n\nCyrus ruled preteen hearts on the small screen before mastering pop stardom's big stages, and throughout her career she's played with sound and image in unexpected and even controversial ways. And she's never balanced pop's glorious artifice with her own soulful authenticity more self-assuredly than she does on her latest album, the rock and roll manifesto Plastic Hearts.\n\nHere, the scene opens with Cyrus, dressed head to toe in rock-star faux fur, in what looks like a teenage girl's bedroom. But the perspective in this pink-and-purple space feels a little ... odd. As Cyrus sings, it becomes clear that this is her Wonderland – like Alice full of magical cake, she's grown to exceed her surroundings. By the end of this three-song set, Cyrus reveals that it's the adolescent enclave that grew too small for her, not the other way around.\n\nThe songs Cyrus offers are as direct and affecting as the set is whimsical. Cyrus has lately proven herself one of pop's great interpretive vocalists, and she scores another triumph with her version of Mazzy Star's \"Fade Into You,\" a hazy psychedelic anthem that she infuses with just the edge of the next day's hangover. The two songs from Plastic Hearts that follow are her own bids at classic-rock timelessness. In \"Golden G-String\" Cyrus assesses her own life in the spotlight with Leonard Cohen-esque charm. And \"Prisoner\" is the power ballad that lets Cyrus really break out – as she leaves the tiny room — just a box, it turns out, on a soundstage – and joins her band, she's as free and self-confident as she's ever been.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Fade Into You\"\n\"Golden G-String\"\n\"Prisoner\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMiley Cyrus: vocals\nStacy Jones: drums\nMike Schmid: keys\nMax Bernstein: guitar\nJamie Arentzen: guitar\nJoe Ayoub: bass\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Johnny Pascucci\nDirector: Alana O'Herlihy\nAssistant Director: Steve Bagnara\nDirector of Photography: Jordan Ritz\nSet Design: Eamonn McGlynn\nSound Tech: Johnny Karlsson\nFOH/Broadcast Engineer: Paul Hager\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann",

However, Bibby explained that he saw his other peers in Chicago, including Lil Reese, Chief Keef, and Lil Durk, signing deals and he thought that it didn't look too difficult.

Whether it's the two towers opening with the perspective of Gandalf, Lost showing us the plane crash from the view of the others or Back to the bloody future 2 showcasing Marty trying not to bone his mum again it always feels like it adds a lot of context.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but if this is your first time here I'm your host Paul and I just wanna give a huge thank you for getting our breakdowns trending on Youtube two weeks in a row. I love you 3000 now let's get into the spoilers.\n\nOk so Monica Rambeau is someone that I feel we need to talk about in general before we get into what happens in the episode itself. Her debut in the MCU actually happened all the way back in the 1990s when we saw her as a kid in Captain Marvel starring Brie Larson.\n\nUnder the name Photon Monica is able to modulate her own energy to change her appearance so that she can look like anyone she wants to. Monica can also fly, fire energy blasts and absorb the energy of things around her. She also possesses superhuman speed, can turn invisible and phase through solid matter.\n\nThere was actually a hint give to us in last weeks episode that she now has been these gifts when being thrown through the membrane as when she landed there was a strange light around her that disipated. Not to jump too far ahead but we know that she will be featuring alongside Ms Marvel and Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel 2 so expect to see a lot more from her in The Marvel Universe.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaiz++anblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\nMusic By Lakey Inspired\n» Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lakeyinspired\n» Spotify: https://goo.gl/aLkwM5\n» SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n» Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired/\n» SnapChat: Lakeyinspired",

AND…they ended it by saying “To be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.”\n\nNow, to be fair to Robinhood - this DID happen to other platforms, as well, who happen to use APEX Clearing to process their trades, and several brokerages, including TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab, placed heavy restrictions on the stock by increasing their margin requirements “until further notice.” \n\nI’m trying to be as neutral as possible when it comes to this, because I don’t think it’s fair to just point your finger at Robinhood, when there’s a LOT more to the situation than most of us realize…but, it’s certainly going to require more research to get to the bottom of exactly what’s going on. \n\nBut…the way I see it, this event will ALMOST CERTAINLY cause there to be further regulation to prevent something like this from happening again. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
