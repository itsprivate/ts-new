  "data/youtube-top/2021/2/_zZ7fIkpBgs.json": "As early as Tuesday, February 2, the SpaceX team will attempt a high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 9 (SN9) ‚Äì the second high-altitude suborbital flight test of a Starship prototype from our site in Cameron County, Texas. Similar to the high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 8 (SN8), SN9 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee ‚Äì approximately 10 km in altitude. SN9 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.\n  \nThe Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship‚Äôs attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN9‚Äôs Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. \n\nA controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  \n\nGiven the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX‚Äôs second high-altitude flight test of Starship!",

The Show is rumored to feature Mephisto, Agatha Harkness, The Grim Reaper and more. Every week we will be doing Wandavision breakdowns, easter egg videos, theories and ending explaineds so definitely stick around. We will also be discussing upcoming Marvel Phase 4 properties such as Spider-man 3, Loki, Falcon and The Winter Soldier, The Eternals and Black Widow.\n\n0:00 Episode 5 Intro\n0:34 Avengers Endgame Post Credits Scene\n1:22 Vision And The Scarlett Witch Graphic Novel\n2:04 Agnes Theories And Clues\n3:34 Episode 5 Sitcom Influences\n5:03 Wandavision Episode 5 Breakdown\n18:04 Wandavision Episode 6 Spoilers And Leaks\n\nOk so Episode 4 ended with us finding out that Scarlett Witch was doing a weekend at Wanda's with Visions dead corpse. It was a mindblowing moment that set her up as the big bad but throughout the season there's been several clues that something more sinister is going on behind the scenes.\n\nWe're gonna be breaking it all down but as always Welcome to the Heavy Spoilers show I'm your host Paul aka the guy who Jimmy Woos you with my card tricks now let's get into the biggidy biggidy breakdown.\n\nNow as always things are time coded below if you wanna skip ahead but as is usual with our breakdowns we're gonna be discussing some key theories up top.\n\nIf you've been keeping up to date with the behind the scenes stuff on the show then you'll know that the showrunner Jac Schaeffer revealed that Wandavision actually takes place almost immediately after Endgame and before the events of Far From Home.\n\nIf you checked out our video last week then you'll has seen us discussing an interview with Paul Bettany in which he revealed that Endgame originally had a post credits scene that set up the events of the show. It was supposed to close out with Wanda going to see Vision's body which was being kept in a drawer and we can see why this was cut as it happens at one point in the episode.\n\nVision actually didn't want to be brought back to life but Wanda doing this shows that she has completely broken his trust.\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n‚Ä¢ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n‚Ä¢ TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n‚Ä¢ YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n‚Ä¢ DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n‚Ä¢ Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",

Tampa controlled most of the game and never gave up the lead after going up 7 to 3. Brady finished with 3 touchdowns and just over 200 passing yards in the win. Patrick Mahomes couldn‚Äôt get the Kansas City Chiefs' offense moving and threw 2 picks without finding the endzone once.

  "data/youtube-top/2021/2/dh3MiwuLntA.json": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit ‚Äî stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ‚Äî just a different space.\n\nNPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week. The lineup includes both emerging and established artists who will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time. This celebration highlights the beautiful cornucopia of Black music and our special way of presenting it. We hope you enjoy.\n\n\"Just bear with me while I just enjoy this and soak in it,\" GIVƒíON admits with a laugh. Switching between the demeanors of a seasoned, nonchalant crooner and a giddy-grinned newbie, the fast-rising R&B star makes a point to show his humility during his long-awaited debut at Tiny Desk.\n\nAccompanied by a minimal, masked-up band and only one background vocalist (a fellow Pisces at that), the baby-face baritone fills the set with resonance and light. He radiates gratitude with every note. Against a blue, moody backsplash of projected music video stills, GIVƒíON notes the divine timing of this performance. \"Any moment to do this would be special,\" he says between songs, \"but I think Black History Month ... just celebrating Black culture for this month, I'm really excited to get to do this on this platform.\"\n\nThrough the throes of the pandemic, GIVƒíON has remained remarkably busy. In a span of eight months, the Long Beach, Calif. newcomer has released two solid EPs, the Grammy-nominated Take Time and When It's All Said And Done. (The latter included one of our favorite songs of 2020, \"Still Your Best.\") For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he borrows from each project to arrange a tantalizing 14-minute sampler ‚Äî showing off just enough to get you to do your Googles and discover more.\n\nMuch like the moment he's trying to savor, GIVƒíON's strength as a singer-songwriter is his ability to make his listener feel suspended in time. As fans quickly discovered on his breakthrough \"Chicago Freestyle\" feature last year, the peaks and valleys of GIVƒíON's tone and the satisfying patterns of his runs don't just serenade; They immerse, they engulf. GIVƒíON's star rising during a time of such sustained uncertainty is no accident, either. Between vulnerable storytelling and clear vocals, GIVƒíON's work provides so many with what they're craving right now: intimacy and consistency.\n\nSET LIST\n\"THE BEACH\"\n\"LIKE I WANT YOU\"\n\"Stuck On You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nGIVƒíON: vocals\nDeondre Ellis: keys\nIvan Chatman: bass\nAndre Montgomery: drums\nJames Murray: guitar\nRaVaughn Brown: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jan Lim, Mitchell Schultz, Will Houlihan\nProducer: Zack Warren\nDirector: Eric Longden\nAudio: Jeremy Gray, Reggie Jones, Al Richardson\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann",

I've been trying to find the words to say for some time now but it's just been too painful to write üò¢üò≠\n\nCarl, God may have been ready to give you your wings, but we were not ready to lose you. Your mom and your daughter may have been ready to reunite with you in Heaven, but we weren't ready to lose you on Earth. You were a real life Angel, giving hope, inspiration and love to Billions of people all around the world touched by your amazing work. You may be gone now, but you will always live in our hearts, and your legacy of changing lives will live on forever üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nFor those that don't know, Carl was in a coma for some time. His doctors said that he wasn't going to make it. His close friends and family said their final goodbyes to him. Then we called on our incredible community to pray for him and ask God for a miracle to happen. And it did. Carl regained consciousness long enough to see his wife over Zoom, for her to sing to him, and for him read some of the hundreds of thousands of comments people left for him all over the world telling him how much he meant to them. And he must've had a big smile on his face reading them. For that I am grateful, knowing his heart must have been full of so much love before God called His Angel back. It makes me so happy to know that you got to see how impactful your life was and how much you meant to everybody.\n\nI have been in touch with his family and we will be helping to take care of his final expenses. We are setting up a memorial for him at our studio and we will continue to share his work for many, many years to come so everyone can know what an incredible man he was. If Carl touched your life and you would also like to help his family who is dealing with tremendous grief, you can donate through this GoFundMe link: https://gofund.me/55f679bb. All proceeds go to his family.\n\n\"With tears of sorrow we cry each day, in angel's arms you were carried away. Our memories of love and laughter shall not fade, for inside our hearts you will always stay.\"\n\n- Dhar Mann\n\nP.S. The ad revenue from this video will be donated to his family.",

May 2021.\n\nAcademy Award¬Æ winner Emma Stone (‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù) stars in Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúCruella,‚Äù an all-new live-action feature film about the rebellious early days of one of cinemas most notorious ‚Äì and notoriously fashionable ‚Äì villains, the legendary Cruella de Vil. ‚ÄúCruella,‚Äù which is set in 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution, follows a young grifter named Estella, a clever and creative girl determined to make a name for herself with her designs. She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella‚Äôs flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar¬Æ winner Emma Thompson (‚ÄúHowards End,‚Äù ‚ÄúSense & Sensibility‚Äù). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.\n¬†\nDisney‚Äôs ‚ÄúCruella‚Äù is directed by Craig Gillespie (‚ÄúI Tonya‚Äù) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, story by Aline Brosh McKenna and Kelly Marcel & Steve Zissis. It was produced by Andrew Gunn (‚ÄúFreaky Friday‚Äù), Marc Platt (‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù) and Kristin Burr (‚ÄúChristopher Robin‚Äù), with Emma Stone, Michelle Wright, Jared LeBoff and Glenn Close serving as executive producers. Two-time Oscar¬Æ- winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Room with a View‚Äù) creates the dazzling and imaginative costumes, which take on a life of their own.\n\nFor more information on ‚ÄúCruella,‚Äù follow us on:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyCruellaDeVil\nTwitter:¬†https://twitter.com/cruella\nInstagram:¬†https://www.instagram.com/disneycruella\nYouTube:https://youtube.com/disneymovietrailers‚Äã\nHashtag: #Cruella",

The Show features Agatha Harkness, The Grim Reaper and more. Every week we will be doing Wandavision breakdowns, easter egg videos, theories and ending explaineds so definitely stick around. We will also be discussing upcoming Marvel Phase 4 properties such as Spider-man 3, Loki, Falcon and The Winter Soldier, The Eternals and Black Widow.\n\nWelcome to the Heavy Spoilers show I'm your host Paul aka the guy who's breakdowns you watch whilst you wait for New Rockstars to upload theirs and this video we have a lot to talk about.\n\nEpisode 7 of Wandavision brings a lot with it and we pick up in the aftermath of Wanda expanding the Hex after she lost her Vision like daredevil. The malcolm in the middle esque entry had Vision saying you're not the boss of me now and the cliffhanger showed SWORD for the clowns they really are. Episode 7 evolves the two storylines in many ways and there's a lot to unpack from the entry.\n\nAs always I'm gonna be discussing some of the more general aspects of the episode up top but if you wanna SPEED through the video then timecodes are linked below.\n\nNow firstly I wanna dicuss Billy and Tommy which just so happens to be the name of both my grandfathers.\n\nIt's all connected.\n\nIt's clear that the characters are becoming Wiccan and Speed and thus I feel this is the best episode to give you the 411 on who they really are. Originally in the comics the twins were introduced as Wanda's Children in the graphic novel Vision and The Scarlett Witch. This book followed the pair as they made a life in New Jersey but there was a twist in the tale. Because Vision was unable to have children, Wanda unwittingly used fragments of Mephisto's soul to give life to them and they were eventually reabsorbed by the villain.\n\nHowever the pair were brought back and they were reincarnated under surrogate parents to become the mutants that we all know and love.\n\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n‚Ä¢ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n‚Ä¢ Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n‚Ä¢ TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n‚Ä¢ YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n‚Ä¢ DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n‚Ä¢ Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n‚ñ∫ Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",

So how do they hash this problem out? They make their own, of course! Who knows what these ideas might lead to?\n\n(I appreciate being let known that ‚Äúinfodump‚Äù is a trait associated with people with ADHD and autism and I am so sorry for the offense I‚Äôve caused for its inclusion in the latest video. The context of that moment, among other moments between Roman and Logan in the series, was the paralleling of myself sometimes being critical of myself for doing the exact same thing in real life. I‚Äôm pretty renown for over-explaining and, even when my friends say it‚Äôs okay, I still find myself apologizing for it. However, I had no idea the term was offensive to some, which is something I needed to learn. For whatever it‚Äôs worth, I love that trait in regards to Logan, and we were narratively depicting Roman to be in the wrong for saying it. Also, Logan is on a track to get vindication for this in the future. I will be sure to triple check any terminology used in the future. Again, I‚Äôm incredibly sorry.)\n\nBIG THANK YOU to our Patrons, who are already making projects such as this much more possible with their support! \n\nIf YOU would like to lend your support and become a Patron, you can do so by heading on over to Patreon.com/ThomasSanders !\n\nEveryone was properly Covid-tested and masked up when they weren't in front of the camera for this shoot!

The crew declared Mayday reporting an engine failure. The aircraft stopped the climb at about 13000 feet, the crew requested to return to Denver after running the checklists. ATC offered any runway, they would make it happen. The aircraft returned to Denver for a safe landing on runway 26 about 23 minutes after departure. The aircraft stopped on the runway for a check by emergency services. Emergency services advised of an active fire within the right hand engine and extinguished the fire a few minutes later. The aircraft was subsequently towed off the runway to a remote parking stand, where passengers disembarked and were bussed to the terminal. There were no injuries.\n\nThe engine inlet fell into the neighbourhood of Broomfield,CO, located about 16nm west of Denver near 13th and Elmwood Street, the debris also struck through the roof of an adjacent house.\n\nBroomfield police reported that although debris impacted the neighbourhood and damaged a number of homes, there were no injuries on the ground. The debris field expands over a nautical mile.\n\nGround observers reported hearing the sound of an explosion like bang, smoke and saw the debris falling down. The aircraft continued flying.\n\nWatch the video to learn more about what happened! \n\nThank you very much for your time!

The real footage in this video was captured by several cameras that are part of the rover's entry, descent, and landing suite. The views include a camera looking down from the spacecraft's descent stage (a kind of rocket-powered jet pack that helps fly the rover to its landing site), a camera on the rover looking up at the descent stage, a camera on the top of the aeroshell (a capsule protecting the rover) looking up at that parachute, and a camera on the bottom of the rover looking down at the Martian surface.\n \nThe audio embedded in the video comes from the mission control call-outs during entry, descent, and landing. \n \nFor more information about Perseverance, visit https://mars.nasa.gov/perseverance\n \nCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech",

  "data/youtube-top/2021/2/TahNMeU3AsQ.json": "Cam Newton sits down exclusively with Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson and Fred Taylor in a rare public conversation about everything on and off the field. \n\nA friendly football discussion of Cam deciding between Chad and Brandon on who the X would be in his ideal offense quickly turns up the heat to hard hitting questions on what went on this past season. Fred says Cam had the hardest job in the league following Tom Brady and relates to the tough position he was put in coming into the New England offense. Cam explains how he found the process of missing the offseason instrumental to getting in sync with his team and a lesson in why the little things are big things in the end. Brandon doesn't shy away from him talking about his up and down play during this past season while calling him out for it on air a few times. Tackling the rumors that Cam is done and seeking retirement-  Cam says he's never been the favorite and that fuels him but he quickly clears up that he is not going out like that and there aren't 32 guys better than he is!! \n\nTaking a trip down memory lane, Cam and Fred reminisce about meeting during Cam's early college football days in Florida and Cam telling the story of how Fred set the bar of professionalism and character that he desired to have in his career. The two reference their old friend and teammate \"Chico\" the late Aaron Hernandez which leads them into a tough discussion of disbelief and confusion with what really went on with him. \n\nChef Jonathan Lowe fills in for Chef Nancie and makes a vegan meal for Cam which immediately draws critique from Chad on healthy eating habits who then volunteers that he should take over Cam's diet this offseason to get him eating right.   \n\nCam exclusively opens up about his new hat line and in celebration of Black History Month a design tribute to honoring trail blazers starting with Rosa Parks. Keeping his business hat on, Cam tells the guys that his passion for cigars, art and live music led him to open Fellaship, an upscale premium dining experience in Atlanta. Applying what he has learned on the field as a leader into running a business, Cam shares why he loves being hands on with the details and the daily operation. \n\nChanging gears real fast- Brandon asks the guys about men's hygiene which leads into a wild conversation about manscaping and the things guys should and shouldn't do! \n\n20% off + free shipping with the code: ATHLETE at manscaped.com. \n#Ad\n\n---------------------------\n\nWATCH MORE ‚Üí https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAaZmvZaF9gtsK1erpReLEv_kiofqr4w\n\nFOLLOW US ON:\nInstagram | https://instagram.com/iamathletepodcast\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nWebsite | https://houseofathlete.com\n\n#IAMATHLETE\n#BrandonMarshall",

  "data/youtube-top/2021/2/wRwId2RfmfA.json": "NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week. The lineup includes both emerging and established artists who will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time. This celebration highlights the beautiful cornucopia of Black music and our special way of presenting it. We hope you enjoy.\n\nBobby Carter | February 25, 2021\nKirk Franklin, set up with his band and choir in a corner of Uncle Jessie's Kitchen, makes a declaration. \"I know you're at home right now, in your draws, listening to some Jesus music. It's ok. Jesus loves you in your draws!\" The Arlington, Texas studio, named after a long time close friend, features a large photo of the iconic \"I AM A MAN\" protest signs from the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike on the wall. The jubilant energy that Franklin and company emit, juxtaposed with a visual reminder of the strife that Black people have endured is illustrative of the importance of gospel music in the Black community.\n\nFor nearly 30 years, Franklin has been widely regarded for revolutionizing gospel. He incorporated secular music, particularly hip-hop, while preserving the message and integrity of traditional gospel. Here, he and his powerhouse choir pace through a decades-long, sixteen Grammy award winning discography of faith, praise and encouragement while cracking plenty of jokes. I cannot recall a more moving Tiny Desk home performance.\n\nAll month long, we've presented artists that speak to the diversity and complexity of Black music--where we've been, where we are and where we're going. For the final show, we take it back to the spiritual roots and there's no one more fitting to cap things off than Mr. Kirk Franklin.\n\nSET LIST\nLove Theory \nSilver and Gold\nMelodies From Heaven \nI Smile\n\nMUSICIANS\nKirk Franklin: vocals, keys\nMelodie Pace: vocals\nDarian Elliot: vocals\nMichael Bethany: vocals\nEboni Ellerson: vocals\nDeon Yancey: vocals\nTia Rudd: vocals\nShaun Martin: keyboard\nMatthew Ramsey: bass\nTerry Baker: drums, percussion\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Clear Scope Media\nAudio: Michael Havens Reese Brooks\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann",
