With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who the singer is behind the mask. The singers may attempt to throw off the crowd, but keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. Each week, a singer is eliminated -- and then reveals his or her true identity.\n\nYou Won't Believe Who's Getting Revealed Tonight! | Season 5 Ep. 1 | THE MASKED SINGER\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MaskedSingerFOX\n\n#TheMaskedSinger",

I had a little more issue trying to sync the clips together near the end but I managed somehow. Also, I want people to still know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. In addition, I did not cross dissolve transition since one viewer recommended not too since it ruins the flow and while looking at it I have to agree. Even though some character skins didn't get a chance to sing I still made sure to each one gets a different skin while also making them look good in terms of their respected fandom.

  "data/youtube-top/2021/3/jO7_NdHZCZk.json": "Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\nPRE-ORDER THE LIMITED EDITION RUBIK'S CUBE:\nhttps://www.moriah-rubiks.com/\n\n_________FAQs__________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. \n\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 26 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here.

Both vaccines have very high \"efficacy rates,\" of around 95%. But the third vaccine introduced in the US, from Johnson & Johnson, has a considerably lower efficacy rate: just 66%.\n\nLook at those numbers next to each other, and it's natural to conclude that one of them is considerably worse. Why settle for 66% when you can have 95%? But that isn't the right way to understand a vaccine's efficacy rate, or even to understand what a vaccine does. And public health experts say that if you really want to know which vaccine is the best one, efficacy isn't actually the most important number at all.\n\nFurther reading from Vox:\n\nWhy comparing Covid-19 vaccine efficacy numbers can be misleading: https://www.vox.com/22311625/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-johnson-moderna-pfizer\n\nThe vaccine metric that matters more than efficacy: https://www.vox.com/22273502/covid-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-johnson-astrazeneca-efficacy-deaths\n\nThe limits of what vaccine efficacy numbers can tell us: https://www.vox.com/21575420/oxford-moderna-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-trial-biontech-astrazeneca-results\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Still I have to admit that I love the unique pixel art and death animation a lot of artist put into these mods, really shows how passionate they are when it comes to their work.

And I‚Äôm sorry. I hope you‚Äôre all ready, because you‚Äôre about to see my story about the time I spent a ridiculous amount of money on a new PC, only to end up spending even more and nearly losing my channel. I thought I‚Äôd try something animated this time and a lot different - instead of me being on screen, I figured a funny cartoon animation in a similar style to theodd1sout would best illustrate how funny and unlucky this whole saga turned out to be. This is a lot more than a minute-long Caddicarus animated - this is a huge retelling of my story animated, in a special one-off animated story time. Actually, now that I think about it, is it theodd1sout or oddonesout? No clue. Maybe this is closer to Jaiden and their animations. Jaidenanimations? Jaidenanimation?

I decided to go shopping at the Dollar Store for a couple of items that I thought would be fun to paint on, customize and decorate to make them more of my style. I noticed shopping at the Dollar Tree, that there were so many cute things that had a lot of easy DIY potential. I wanted to do this to show that you don't need to spend a lot to have fun with art and customizing things. There are so many cheap and affordable items to be painted on! This video starts out with a mini dollar tree haul, and then I go on to feature 3 different $1 makeovers. I hope I give you some fun ideas for easy dollar store flips!\n\nLet me know if you want me to try this again or if you want me to try the \"EXTREME MODE\" (lol) dollar store makeover where I choose my art supplies from the dollar store as well.\n\n\nPRE-ORDER THE LIMITED EDITION RUBIK'S CUBE:\nhttps://www.moriah-rubiks.com/\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously.

  "data/youtube-top/2021/3/CKvGKTsAoO4.json": "The operators of Egypt's Suez Canal say technical or human error could have caused a huge container ship to run aground. Engineers are working round the clock to refloat the Ever Given. The vessel has been blocking one of the world's busiest shipping lanes for the last five days. The chairman of the canal authority hopes a dredging operation will free the ship in the next few days.\nHow did the Ever Given, one of the biggest container ships ever built, end up blocking one of the world‚Äôs busiest shipping lanes? And how long will it stay there? The chairman of the Suez Canal Authority is facing more questions than he can answer. But he says more than just strong winds caused the accident.\nBut while experts investigate further, the ship still has to be freed. 20,000 ton of sand have been removed from the area around the bow, and 9,000 tons of ballast water have been pumped out, in order to lighten the vessel. The operation has so far been unsuccessful - but two more tugs are on their way. If they can't move it, the next step will be to unload the cargo.\nThe German insurance group Allianz says the blockage is costing the global economy between 6 and 10 billion dollars a week. A tenth of the world's merchant shipping uses the canal.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#SuezCanal #EverGiven #Egypt",

So, late last year we decided to take the plunge and move across the country for a fresh start in a new place. After doing some serious decluttering, we packed up our house, grabbed our cat, and hit the road (and vlogged our whole cross-country road trip in our minivan!) It's been a couple of months and we are finally set up enough to dive back into making videos, so here is our moving vlog! Hopefully you guys enjoy it, and thank you for being so patient with us while we figure all of this out. \n\nAlso, sorry about any smudginess of the windshield! It was tough to keep clean on our drive, but I know sometimes it can look gross, so sorry about that!

  "data/youtube-top/2021/3/gjCSJIAKEPM.json": "As early as Tuesday, March 30, the SpaceX team will attempt a high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 11 (SN11) ‚Äì our fourth high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from Starbase in Texas. Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests of Starship, SN11 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee ‚Äì approximately 10 km in altitude. SN11 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.\n  \nThe Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship‚Äôs attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN11‚Äôs Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. \n\nA controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  \n\nGiven the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX‚Äôs fourth high-altitude flight test of Starship!",

If so, your most common question has been, \"When is Season Two coming out?\" Or in many cases, it hasn't been a question, it's been more like, \"GIVE ME SEASON TWO NOW!\" Well, the wait is over. Launching with a huge global livestream Easter Sunday at 8pm ET (important details below), Season Two is here.\n\nHaven't seen The Chosen? Don't watch this trailer! We encourage you to catch up on Season One fast, because we can't promise the millions who will watch Season Two won't reveal spoilers. So stop what you're doing and go \"binge Jesus,\" as we like to say.\n\n\"How do I watch The Chosen?\" Good question. It's free and easy. Yes, free...doesn't even require an email address. Look up \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your phone apps, download it, and then you can freely and easily connect it directly from there to your streaming device (Apple TV, Firestick, Roku, Chromecast). Don't have a streaming device? Probably time to get one.\n\n\"Wait, free and easy? How is that possible?\" Again, good question. We happen to be the #1 highest crowd-funded media project of all time, which means we've done this completely outside the system. We built our own app, we've sold our own DVDs, and instead of requiring payment to watch, we offer you the chance to \"pay it forward\" so we can continue to keep it free and also produce future seasons. But you don't have to. Seriously.\n\nWe're watched in literally every country in the world, we've been translated into over 50 languages, and we've heard from literally millions of people that getting to know the authentic Jesus has changed their life.\n\nSeason Two launches Easter Sunday, 8:00pm ET, with a huge global livestream on our FB & Youtube channels and \"The Chosen\" app, and from then on, it'll be available forever.\n\nWelcome to The Chosen. Get used to different.\n\nWatch The Chosen on our free app: https://thechosen.tv/app\nWear The Chosen and go deeper with our study materials: https://thechosengifts.com\n\n#BingeJesus by subscribing to our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/thechosenseries?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch More!\n\nThe immense weight of playing Jesus\nhttps://youtu.be/CZdB7H8ty8g\n\n#GetUsedToDifferent by following us:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/InsidetheChosen/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thechosentvseries/\nhttps://twitter.com/thechosentv\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@thechosentv",
