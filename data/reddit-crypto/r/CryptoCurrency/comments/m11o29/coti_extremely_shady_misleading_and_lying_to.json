They claimed that they have a decentralized consensus mechanism whilst other coins didn&#39;t. They claimed to be faster than other coins as well. Upon asking them for proof of tx speed in their TG group, i was banned immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, they claim to be able to offer &quot;chargebacks&quot; by way of a <strong>decentralized jury</strong> that can make decisions on buyer vs merchant issues. When I emailed the team about how to become one of these jurors, they claimed that Jury Selection was done by the Coti Team, to which I responded &quot;so how is that decentralized?&quot;, and never got a response.  </p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, they claim to have <strong>&quot;zero-to-low fees&quot;</strong>, but upon speaking to a Coti node operator, I learned that nodes are able to set any fees they like on transactions. So how does that make it a zero-to-low fee system?</p>\n\n<p>Too many thing&#39;s do not add up at all, and upon calling out the Coti Team on Twitter - they do not respond. The CEO - does not respond. Telegram group banned me for asking questions. </p>\n\n<p>Fourthly, they claimed that they &quot;<strong>Integrated with Apple</strong>&quot;, whereas in reality, Simplex (a platform that supports 100s of cryptocurrencies including Coti - integrated with Apple). Yet there are hundreds of paid marketers on Reddit and Twitter saying that Coti and Apple have partnered up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guys just beware with this Coin - too many lies and misleading statements - I guess this is all of crypto though. However they are now in the top 150 coins, all by way of lying and misleading investors.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>edit - just saw that you can&#39;t even post to their subreddit as it&#39;s &quot;submissions restricted&quot; <a href=\"/r/cotinetwork/\">/r/cotinetwork/</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>edit2</strong> the paid Coti marketers/shills have arrived downvoting this and every one of my replies to oblivion. this post was almost at 100 upvotes and suddenly at 60. major brigading happening from new accounts</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
