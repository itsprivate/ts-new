I&#39;m not going to specifically call out any coins because that&#39;s not really the point of this post. And to be honest I haven&#39;t been following the price action of a lot of coins as hard as a lot of people.</p>\n\n<p>However, I think there are some people that need to hear this. </p>\n\n<p>I began investing into crypto at the beginning of the last cycle&#39;s ICO. At the time there was even more speculative hype than there is now. I&#39;m sure people that were in the market at the time remember this period well. ICOs were popping off left and right. It was tempting to start throwing money everywhere because everything was flying off like fireworks, similar to the last run up we just had. And that&#39;s exactly what I did initially. It wasn&#39;t until I took a step back and saw coins falling as quickly as they rose that I reassessed what I was doing. I followed the golden rule of never investing more than I could afford to lose, but I rushed in without doing enough clear research. Eventually I pulled out of most of these alt positions, luckily around a BTC break even point and began making more level headed informed decisions. If I didn&#39;t do this I would have been burned hard. When I say BTC break even point I&#39;m referring to Satoshi valuation, even though I may have lost USD valuation at the time.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to include a snapshot of this day 3 years ago because it is around the time the ICO craze was cooling off and coincidentally around the time I decided to be less emotional chasing hype and making more informed decisions. I also find it kind of interesting to see the changes in the top 100.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20180520/\">https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20180520/</a></p>\n\n<p>I continue to hold one of these coins despite it losing over 95% of its value and all signs pointing to being a dead shitcoin as a reminder to not buy and trade emotionally in this space. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day there are going to be winners and losers in this space and unfortunately there are going to be more losers than winners. Like I said in the title, it is entirely possible some coins don&#39;t recover fully from this current crash. </p>\n\n<p>I think cryptocurrency is here to stay, otherwise I obviously wouldn&#39;t be here. I also believe the market as a whole will recover and continue to climb to new heights whether that be weeks or years from now. Do your own research and take emotions out of the equation and you should be fine. I just hope that after this shock some people are also recognizing the risk in this space.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
