  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people believe that we are late. Others believe that we are early. I believe that both of those answers are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: No we are not early so much that $1000 in BTC will make you rich. But also you are not late to the party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin exist since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin first transaction happened in May 2010, 16 months after its creation. We are talking about Bitcoin when its price was less then a cent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, I still don&amp;#39;t see a massige global adoption, but I believe that it is coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto is a young space, vast majority of crypto coins in top100 are less then five years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This kind of investment is a little bit hard to understand for a lot of people, that is why maybe we don&amp;#39;t see growth as much as we hope. Or we are just expecting too much way too fast. Crypto is complicated and we can all agree on that. So were other technologies in the begining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced technologies like &lt;strong&gt;internet&lt;/strong&gt; are good example. Internet was invented in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1993 we had around 14 million users of internet worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1994 we had around 25 million users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1995 we had around 44 million users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said worldwide? Actually, most of these users were from America btw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are low numbers considering what we have today almost 5 billion users (at least devices) on internet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also shows that often it takes many years for people to start adopting new technologies. You know, back in the days there was no web browsers. To start using internet you had to type commands on some ugly black and white, or green screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, we have more then 300 million people that used or are still using crypto in some way, while 18,000 business are accepting them as a form of payment - &lt;a href=\"https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/\"&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to data acquired by Finbold, about 10.2 percent of the global population using the internet owns some form of cryptocurrency - &lt;a href=\"https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-02-14/10-of-the-global-population-owns-cryptocurrency/65227\"&gt;news source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, crypto users are growing globally fast. Maybe just not fast as you would like to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this chart I found on the web, it shows that the crypto has the fastest rate of adoption compared to other technologies in our world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mm0inikgdss81.png?width=934&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf750bc5d5b99e92aff724a207e092a1fc6d2e95\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mm0inikgdss81.png?width=934&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf750bc5d5b99e92aff724a207e092a1fc6d2e95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, people are talking it is &amp;quot;too late&amp;quot; because they don&amp;#39;t believe that they will see massive gains if they invest $1000 in BTC. Well, you probably won&amp;#39;t get rich with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adopting a new technology is not a walk in the park, that is why a lot of us here says &amp;quot;be patient&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is more then 16,000 cryptocurrencies today, and if we take a look at 2017 we will see that a lot of them went really down, or really dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It probably is going to happen again with a lot of cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will take time, but the way I see it, you are not late, crypto is yet to come, and I don&amp;#39;t really think that this can be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you start investing today you are still early, but not too early. You are 100% not late.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
