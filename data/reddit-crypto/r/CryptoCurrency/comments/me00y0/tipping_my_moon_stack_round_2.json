Unfortunately I only have 10% of the moons I had previously so I’m gonna have to stretch this one a bit more. Next moon distribution I plan on doing the same thing! Also, I won’t get around to tipping you until later tonight since I’m out running errands and enjoying the warm NYC weather. </p>\n\n<p>My ask is the same as before. Use the moons to tip quality submissions on this subreddit. If a post educates you, informs you, or makes you laugh, throw the OP a few moons!!</p>\n\n<p>Love,\nx0g</p>\n\n<p>Edit: fuckit 5 moons to the first 60 posts. Spread the wealth like a communist baby</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: make sure you set up ya vaults before I start tipping I’ll just skip you this time</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: I’ve gotten a few messages telling me I’m a moon farmer. Y’all. I gave out 3.5k moons last time and only got 300 upvotes and even less than that from the moon distribution since it’s not even 1 moon per upvote now. Daddy chill.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: I just sent out half of my moons. I stopped on <a href=\"/u/nz1390\">/u/nz1390</a> . I&#39;ll get back to it later tonight and get you all your fake internet gold love u</p>\n\n<p>Edit 5: I’m sorry yall im too tired but I’ll get to it tomorrow. I promise you you’ll have your moons :)</p>\n\n<p>Also I spoke with the Reddit mods and unfortunately this is the last moon tipping round I’ll be able to do. Apparently the new rules state that giveaways have to be $100 each, and  have to only go to 1-3 people. I have more giveaways in mind, but If anyone has creative suggestions for me that would be great!!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
