If there is no intent to sell, holders are incentivized to earn rewards rather than store them on exchanges</li>\n<li>Thirdly, and most simply, the historic price drop indicates mass selling.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Off-Chain Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There was a lack of transparency regarding token allocation and unlocking as there is very little public information in the way of token unlock schedules</li>\n<li>Contrast this to UniSwap, who released breakdowns for allocation by category of holder, and a breakdown of the unlocking of the treasury</li>\n<li>Dfinity’s founder sent a twitter reply claiming: \n\n<ul>\n<li>“Foundation didn&#39;t vest itself but plans on putting most of its ICP into neurons. It is doing this carefully to make sure foundation+team members don&#39;t control the network (you wouldn&#39;t believe it based upon what you hear, but in actual fact, we care a lot about decentralization!)”</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Having no vesting essentially means that token holders are less incentivized to hold their tokens should something happen with the project(like a rug pull, team dump, or VC dump)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Seed Supporter’s Struggles</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At time of launch, seed supporters were entitled to about 25% of the total ICP</li>\n<li><strong>These initial investors seem to not have been aware of how to access their tokens or how the tokens would unlock until listing day</strong></li>\n<li>Dfinity published an article on Medium on how to access seed tokens\n\n<ul>\n<li>This article explains that seed investors would be subject to a 4-year unlocking schedule:\n\n<ul>\n<li>“Seed donors will receive all of their ICP tokens at Genesis Unlock, but these will be staked inside 49voting neurons within the NNS. Each neuron that is delivered will have a different “dissolve delay”configured by the NNS. This configures the minimum period required to unlock the ICP tokens staked inside. One of their neurons will have a dissolve delay of 0 days, allowing the staked ICP tokens to be unlocked immediately, if desired (subject to applicableAML/KYC verification). Another will have a dissolve delay of approximately 30 days, another of 60 days, another of 90 days, and so on.(Note:Configured dissolve delays may have some small random number of days added or subtracted by the NNS).” </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The provided set of steps to retrieve seed tokens is complicated and technical, with users reporting bugs.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The steps could not be performed on Windows or new Macs with M1 chips</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Dfinity support was unsurprisingly lacking\n\n<ul>\n<li>Users on the support forum report being redirected back to the forum after submitting tickets for their issues</li>\n<li>Some users report buying new computers to access their tokens.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If Dfinity intended to dump, it would make sense to effectively disallow seed investors to access and sell their tokens</li>\n<li>Many seed investors were forced to watch as they watched what would have been a life-changing investment slip through their fingers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Any one of these pieces of evidence may easily be swept under the rug as a new project fumbling through release.</li>\n<li>As the pieces come together, it seems clear that there was intent behind all of these events.</li>\n<li>This rug pull event stresses the need for better analytics on cryptocurrencies\n\n<ul>\n<li>ICP buyers should have known about suspicious token flows and off-chain activity.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
