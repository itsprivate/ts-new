There are coins and projects that have and will fail, that is no doubt, some are just stupid. But the fundamentals and the concept of crypto is firm and secure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The technology of ledgers and blockchains is here to stay, how a project or coin uses or misuses it is not proof that the technology is bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So look at crypto as an industry and technology not as just the coin or the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
