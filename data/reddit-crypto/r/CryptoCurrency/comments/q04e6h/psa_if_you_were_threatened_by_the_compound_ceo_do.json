In response to this, the CEO, on his own personal twitter account, threatened to doxx users if they did not return the money.</p>\n\n<p>In legal terms, this is called <strong>coercion,</strong> which is not only illegal, it is a <strong>felony.</strong> This idiot publicly, acting as the head of his company and on his <strong>personal</strong> twitter, stated his intent to commit a felony with malicious intent. Not only should you <strong>not</strong> return that money, you should see if he attempts this and once he does, sue him back into his mother&#39;s womb.</p>\n\n<p>His company offers him no protection, he made these threats under his own personal twitter account which directly places him in the crossroads of a lawsuit if he tries anything. Don&#39;t be afraid of his threats; If he tries <strong>anything</strong>, you will be walking away with an even larger airdrop, this time out of his own personal vault.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR; Don&#39;t return the money, sue him into the stone ages if he doxxes you.</p>\n\n<p>This money is <strong>legally</strong> yours. By all law and legal definition, this money is yours and any threats from the company to obtain it are what? Illegal</p>\n\n<h1>Citi Bank Case Law from similar incident</h1>\n\n<p>Citi Bank had this exact situation happen to them. They filed an appeal in court and it was ruled that those who received the money were the <strong>legal</strong> owners and that they were entitled to keep the funds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/20cv6539%20Citibank%20Opinion.pdf\">Citi Bank Court Ruling</a></p>\n\n<p>&quot; The Clerk of Court is therefore directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendants and to close this case. &quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
