Posts about crypto usually get bombed with the most classic argument after its all a scam: &amp;quot;crypto is killing the environment due to mining&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean it&amp;#39;s right to some extent that crypto is using electricity that is unsustainable for mining. With that dancing the environment. But those people are onto some other stuff. Many thinking that all 5k cryptos use mining that is 100% unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s be clear very few cryptos nowadays use pow and even then the energy for mining is getting more and more sustainable. At least already more than their beloved banks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing so many people uneducated about crypto but spreading hate shows how much growing room we still have left.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
