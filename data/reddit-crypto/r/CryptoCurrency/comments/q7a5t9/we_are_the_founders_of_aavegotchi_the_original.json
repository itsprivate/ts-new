  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>About Aavegotchi</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aavegotchis are playable NFTs that act as interest-generating piggy banks, created by staking DeFi tokens directly into the NFT. Aavegotchis are dynamic NFTs, which means their metadata changes over time based on interaction with the owner. The more you love your Aavegotchi, the more valuable it becomes!</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most NFTs, Aavegotchis desire daily interaction, which led our team to deploy on Polygon, the leading sidechain of Ethereum. This allowed us to put every aspect of Aavegotchi on the blockchain, including all dynamic metadata, and even the adorable art! </p>\n\n<p>Our team isn’t content to just launch an NFT. We imagine an entire playable world built around our spooky frens, called the Gotchiverse. We recently released a trailer for the Gotchiverse gameplay here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BxYQoDKO62Y\">https://youtu.be/BxYQoDKO62Y</a>. The first phase of the game is expected to launch in late Q4 2021, and will feature ownable land parcels and four play-to-earn tokens, known as Alchemica. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Aavegotchi Ecosystem</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aavegotchi’s native token, the GHST Token, is the fuel for the Aavegotchi ecosystem. You can stake GHST to earn FRENS points (loyalty points used for participating in NFT Raffles) or spend GHST in the Aavegotchi Baazaar -- our home-grown NFT marketplace. </p>\n\n<p>Staking GHST is a great way to dip your toe into the game and learn the ropes. Single-staking GHST is our most popular option, and we also offer incentivized liquidity pairs for GHST-USDC, GHST-ETH, and GHST-QUICK. </p>\n\n<p>Just by providing liquidity or single-staking GHST, you can earn FRENS points, which can be converted into Raffle tickets for entry into our famous NFT Raffles. Prizes up for grabs in these raffles include Aavegotchi wearables (skins for your Gotchi!), Aavegotchi Portals, and coming soon--REALM parcels, our version of LAND in the Gotchiverse. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Play-to-Earn</strong></p>\n\n<p>In its current form, Aavegotchi’s play-to-earn aspect comes through <strong>Rarity Farming</strong>. Rarity Farming is an innovative game mechanism pioneered by Aavegotchi. It strives to reward the users who are the most thoughtfully and enthusiastically engaged with the ecosystem. As its name suggests, this is a process where you attempt to raise the rarest Aavegotchis, and get rewarded for doing so. Rarity Farming pays out the leaders in three categories: base rarity score (BRS), kinship, and experience.</p>\n\n<p>However, with the launch of the Gotchiverse, “play to earn” will take on a whole new meaning, as players will be actively earning Alchemica yield while playing the Aavegotchi game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Gotchiverse REALM</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Gotchiverse REALM</strong> is Aavegotchi’s metaverse, where players can explore, build, battle and earn. The Gotchiverse REALM itself will also bring with it new use cases for the GHST Token as well as a free-to-play aspect of the game. Players can harvest the four elements of the Gotchiverse -- “<strong>Gotchus Alchemica.</strong>” </p>\n\n<p>Gotchus Alchemica are ERC20 tokens known as Fud, Fomo, Alpha, and Kek. They can be used to craft installations within the Gotchiverse to improve your REALM parcel, which help you farm faster, or defend against intruders.  </p>\n\n<p>Gotchus Alchemica will be exchangeable through our native decentralized exchange: The Gotchus Alchemica Exchange. Initially, the GAX exchange will support pairs of each element with the GHST Token. To incentivize liquidity on the GAX, an ERC20 Token called GLMR will be distributed to all liquidity providers. GLMR can be spent to reduce the building time of installations within the Gotchiverse. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Free-to-Play</strong></p>\n\n<p>The free-to-play entry point for the Gotchiverse will come through <strong>“Lickquidator Credits.”</strong> Once available, Lickquidator credits can be earned through completing tasks, participating in airdrops, referring friends, and other ways in the Gotchiverse. Lickquidator Credits allow users to play as a <strong>Lickquidator</strong>, the villain of the Gotchiverse. The goal of Lickquidators is to collect loose Alchemica that has been spilled around the Gotchiverse. Lickquidators can also engage in combat with Aavegotchis and offensive Installations to earn Alchemica. We are already experiencing more than 1000 users per day and expect exponential growth of our user base when the free-to-play aspect is in place, removing all barriers of entry to the game. </p>\n\n<p>We hope you’ll join us, and look forward to answering your questions!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here today to answer your questions are:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Coder Dan - (CEO and Summoner of Aavegotchi) - <a href=\"/u/cinnabarhorse\">u/cinnabarhorse</a></p>\n\n<p>Jesse “gldnXross” Johnson - (COO and Summoner of Aavegotchi) - <a href=\"/u/gldnXross\">u/gldnXross</a></p>\n\n<p>Gravy - (Director of Marketing and Reddit Admin) - <a href=\"/u/Aavegotchi\">u/Aavegotchi</a></p>\n\n<p>We’ll begin answering questions at 10am EST and will continue answering for most of the day!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Useful Links:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check out our official Wiki for everything you need to know about Aavegotchi and follow us on social media to join the frenliest community in crypto!</p>\n\n<p>Official <a href=\"https://aavegotchi.com/\">Website</a></p>\n\n<p>Official <a href=\"https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/\">Wiki</a></p>\n\n<p>Official <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Aavegotchi/\">Subreddit</a></p>\n\n<p>Official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aavegotchi\">Twitter</a></p>\n\n<p>Official <a href=\"https://aavegotchi.medium.com/\">Medium</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>[AMA Closing]</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for participating and thank you to the <a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\">r/cryptocurrency</a> mod team for giving us this opportunity!
