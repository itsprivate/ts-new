However the champions league final has a lot more, in 2021 700 million people watched Chelsea win. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year is the World Cup finals as well, the final typically has 1 to 1.2 billion viewers, ten times more than the super bowl. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So will we see more big crypto ads for these events? Crypto.com already have a sponsorship deal with PSG who usually do well in the champions league. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or is the super bowl special? Is advertising to the average American just significantly more valuable than the rest of the world?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
