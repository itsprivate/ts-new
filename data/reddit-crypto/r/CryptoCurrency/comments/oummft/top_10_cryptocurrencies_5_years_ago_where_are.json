  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Bitcoin(BTC) - Forever the king keeps marching on. Currently down 37% from ATH.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum(ETH) - Lost #2 spot a few times in the last 5 years but has regained the spot and remains second. Currently down 48% from ATH.</p>\n\n<p>Steem(STEEM) - Reached ATH of $8 during 2017 bull market. Currently down 95% from ATH. Market cap now is lower than 5 years ago. Will probably never recover again. 0 GitHub commits in the last 5 months. Currently ranked #168. </p>\n\n<p>Ripple(XRP) - Always sticking around in the top 6. Reached #2 in 2017 bull market. Didn&#39;t rally as much as other altcoins this year due to SEC controversy. Down 82% from ATH. Currently ranked #6</p>\n\n<p>Litecoin(LTC) - Used to be a fixture in the top 10 until this year. DeFi coins and stable coins have pushed it out of top 10 and although it&#39;s useful as testnet for BTC, will probably not regain top 10 spot again. Down 67% from ATH. Currently ranked #13.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum Classic(ETC) - The original Ethereum blockchain before the DAO hack. Still around and still somewhat popular on Robinhood even though there is not much development. Down 70% from ATH. Currently ranked #18.</p>\n\n<p>Dash(DASH) - The masternodes POW opt-in privacy coin which gained crazy popularity in 2017 but has completely lost its relevance since then. Down 91% from ATH and unlikely to recover. Currently ranked #57.</p>\n\n<p>NEM(XEM) - Another massively hyped enterprise blockchain project during 2017 bull run. XEM was somewhat like ADA is currently. Everything based on academic research in network theory using a unique proof-of-importance consensus model. Down 93% from ATH and unlikely to recover. Currently ranked #61.</p>\n\n<p>MaidSafeCoin(MAID) - Probably the first big distributed storage and file sharing altcoin focused on user privacy. The project actually started even before Bitcoin in 2006 without a cryptocurrency and the token was launched in 2014. MAID saw a little resurgence this year with other storage coins. Down 51% from ATH. Currently ranked #123.</p>\n\n<p>Lisk(LSK) - One of the first dPOS or delegated proof-of-stake blockchain for DApps allowing developers to build their own blockchain as interlinked sidechains to Lisk blockchain. LSK was massively popular during 2017 bull market. Down 94% from ATH. Unlikely to recover. Currently ranked #117.</p>\n\n<p>How many are still in the top 10? Three.</p>\n\n<p>How many are in the top 50? Five.</p>\n\n<p>How many are in the top 100? Seven.</p>\n\n<p>Hype never lasts. Fundamentals last forever.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
