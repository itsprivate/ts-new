  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There are so many SHIB and other low price coins investors that deliberately put a lot of money into low price coins thinking that if they one day go up to $1, they will be a millionaire. What these people fail to grasp though is the concept of Market Cap. In crypto, Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the price of a single coin at any given time.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, in SHIB&#39;s case, there are currently 394.80 trillion coins in circulation, multiplied by the current price of $0.00000644 give it a $2.54 billion market cap.</p>\n\n<p>(394.80T coins) x ($0.00000644/coin) = $2.54 Bn Market Cap</p>\n\n<p>Because of this, if SHIB were to reach $0.01, it would need a market cap of about $3.9 trillion. To put that into perspective, BTC has a market cap of only $631 billion, and is the coin with the highest market cap on the market. That&#39;s more than 6x Bitcoin&#39;s current market cap! In fact Apple, the company with the biggest market cap in the stock market, only has a market cap of $2.1 trillion dollars, so for SHIB to reach $0.01 would make SHIB worth more than Apple. And that&#39;s just if it were to reach $0.01, not to mention $1!</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the more coins a crypto has in circulation, the less valuable they become, meaning that as SHIB adds more coins, the less valuable the rest become. This is due to inflation, which is why the USD is becoming less valuable, meaning minting more coins won&#39;t just drive the price up. </p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m not trying to pick on SHIB investors. This goes for all coins, not just SHIB. You need to look at the price, as well as the amount of coins in circulation. Just because the price is low doesn&#39;t mean it will someday reach $0.01 or $1. However, that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make money with them, you just have to be realistic about your expectations. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long explanation, but I thought some people could benefit from such an explanation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
