Here&amp;#39;s a fact for you all, viewership of the superbowl has been consistently going down for more than a decade since 2010. So less people are watching the game in general. About half of those people are just there for the ads and a majority of them are gonna be sharing the ads on Facebook, a social media platform that didn&amp;#39;t grow last period and has an aging userbase to boot. So less people and mostly older that aren&amp;#39;t gonna take financial risk are watching. I doubt Auntie BJ is gonna invest in crypto because Tom Brady told them about FTX. I can see my brother who uses facebook and has no teeth left seeing the ad and wanting to FOMO in. So that&amp;#39;s the audience they&amp;#39;re mainly getting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also just Americans. No one in Europe is gonna be watching the game and or gives a shit about Tom Brady. No one in Brazil is gonna be watching. Americans are not the only people invested in crypto, most South Koreans have no idea how American football works or again, gives a shit about ads that they wouldn&amp;#39;t understand without subtitles and who is gonna be writing subtitles for ads for an American sporting event outside of Spanish and English?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, why would the news care about a crypto ad? Do you expect an interview with Tom Brady breaking it down his involvement and a full history on the past year of crypto? I&amp;#39;ll bet they will talk about how much is spent on the ads this year and how much FTX grew and paid Tom Brady and then move on with their day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This idea that a single ad during an American sporting event is gonna put us into a bull run is just silly. This is Saturday Night Live or Doge day again. There&amp;#39;s no reason to think prices will go up except for hope. But they wanna cover their tracks and say it&amp;#39;ll affect the prices in future. Okay, I drank coffee this morning and so the prices will go back up &amp;#39;someday&amp;#39;, that&amp;#39;s my prediction based on nothing substantial.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
