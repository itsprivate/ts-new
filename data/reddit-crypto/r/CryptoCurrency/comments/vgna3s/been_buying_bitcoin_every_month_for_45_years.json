I&amp;#39;ve been writing this blog for almost 2 years where I document my journey and you can follow how my retirement plan is progressing. Crashes like this always feel at the moment that they are taking the goal further away from me. But in hindsight, big portion of my accumulation has happened during similar times, for example, in 2018-2019 + the covid crash of 2020. This too shall pass, and our future situation is gonna be determined based on how we act right now. Seize the day! Keep stacking!
