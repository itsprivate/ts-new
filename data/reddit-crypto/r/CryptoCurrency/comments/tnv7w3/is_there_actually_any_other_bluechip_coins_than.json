Tether is obviously doomed, XRP is battling in court, SOL is going out every month, LUNA is too new to tell, ADA is more buzz than actual stuff, and the list goes like that for every crypto according to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have seen a couple of top 10 cryptos over the past few years loose out completely. So what do you think? Is there any coin that actually has capability to survive anything and always stay where it is today?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
