Because Bitcoin and other cryptos are supposed to be a hedge against the stock markets corrections. But bitcoin basically follows the stock market. And if a recession happens I want to be making money on crypto so that I doesn’t have to worry about a recession or inflation. I hope it will change in the future so that Bitcoin becomes a digital gold that can be used to hedge against stock market corrections and recessions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone agree with me on this or am I delusional for thinking that crypto should have been the ultimate hedge against inflation and recessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
