Just a little more extra money running one miner compared to the expenses the average American has.  You&#39;re not gonna make even close to $20K extra a year running a single miner in your home unless BTC has another massive bullrun.   I&#39;d be a millionaire, I&#39;d sell everything to have 50 miners.  </p>\n\n<p>Despite this fact, the media and the non-crypto masses will view you as a wasteful piece of shit.   Doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re going through either.    Lost your job, lost your business because of forced lockdowns.</p>\n\n<p>So you&#39;re a piece of shit for trying to open your business, and now that you found a new way to make some extra cash mining, you&#39;re a piece of shit for that. </p>\n\n<p>But if you&#39;re rich...</p>\n\n<p>Most people will probably view you as very intelligent based off how much money you have.   After all, more money = more IQ.</p>\n\n<p><em>Wow, that guy has lots of money, he must be smart</em> </p>\n\n<p>Nobody will call you out for running 10 Central Air units 24/7 in the spring/summer when you only spend 10 days home. </p>\n\n<p>I worked as an HVAC tech for over 10 years.  In Bergen county in around the town of Alpine(Where Chris Rock lives/lived)  I&#39;ve worked in plenty of these homes that are running 6-10 HVAC units, and one extra in the guest house.   One unit is running more energy than a miner, and they definitely run them all day to maintain temps because usually there&#39;s plenty of massive glass cathedral like windows letting sun light and heat in.    Also the one int eh guest house has to run and maintain 70F...JUST IN CASE a special guest arrives. </p>\n\n<p>1 Antminer S9 running 24hours a day is using a total of 36KWH </p>\n\n<p>1 5 Ton central AC unit running 12Hrs a day is using 60KWH</p>\n\n<p>Rule of thumb is 1KWH per ton. 5 TON = 5KWH x 12 = 60KWH.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine 6 5 ton units on average running while these FKs are getting their balls shaved in Bahamas?  I&#39;ve seen 10.  The guy was NEVER HOME.  Only person I met was the house sitter. A guy that got lost showing me around. We kept opening closets that we thought were doors.    That&#39;s 600KWH in 12 hours.    😲.  Idk guy owns a company that makes airplane parts. </p>\n\n<p>Think they give a shit?  Not at all.  The media knows not to call them out because maybe they are scared about the connections they have. Maybe they will be out of the job?</p>\n\n<p>But who&#39;s scared of regular people?  Let&#39;s just call them out as they continue to devalue their hard earned inflated fiat, and fill them with empty promises when it comes vote time. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to run a miner.   Run a miner.  Don&#39;t  feel bad.  You&#39;re trying to get a little extra. Times are tough.   Don&#39;t live your life abiding by other people&#39;s ignorant needs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
