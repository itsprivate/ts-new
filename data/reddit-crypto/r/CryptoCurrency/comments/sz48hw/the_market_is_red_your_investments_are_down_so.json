But here’s a high-level overview of what we’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile game release:&lt;/strong&gt; We have an internal team designing and building out a mobile version of Gods Unchained to ease the barrier of entry by allowing the game to be played on the go. Our first touchstone is to get a playable alpha out this year. Our hope is to deliver the first access to our players in the first half of next year, with a wider alpha sometime in the second half of the year.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the game:&lt;/strong&gt; We have a heap of new cards coming out early this year with a refresh of our main card set: the Core set (a set is a collection of cards). We also have brand new NFT expansion sets in the works, alongside new game functionalities, items, and modes. To tie these developments all together, the team is also hard at work improving the new player onboarding experience. This will make it easier for anyone and everyone to join Gods Unchained and get playing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0aoaq5tahhj81.png?width=603&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8563d6d8e0cc6727bcd944d6647cb6d572ece69e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0aoaq5tahhj81.png?width=603&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8563d6d8e0cc6727bcd944d6647cb6d572ece69e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/akyq6d7chhj81.jpg?width=289&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3e0c731f0a722a7e70c7db92818608ac9ec5553f\"&gt;https://godsunchained.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;It&amp;#39;s Time to Duel!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/r746l1aphhj81.gif\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/r746l1aphhj81.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of you decide to play and are up for a challenge let me know, Direct challenges are available and it would be fun to play some of you on this sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: play Gods Unchained to distract yourself during crypto winter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
