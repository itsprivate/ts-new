That&amp;#39;s the main reason why you KEEP doing it. This will mess with your thinking, because you are chasing only that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you are trading crypto, you will definietly need to get your mind right before making any decisions. \nWe all know that good feeling when we see the gains. It triggers dopamine, just like an addiction. Now, I want to say there is nothing wrong with feeling good about the gains. However, unfortunately if you have an addiction (doesn&amp;#39;t matter what kind: drugs, porn, smoking very regularly) you are much more likely to just trade for the feeling of it. \nI experienced this myself.\nIt&amp;#39;s also dangerous to trade when you are in the process of kicking the addiction!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t get rid of it alone, get help from others and don&amp;#39;t be ashamed of it! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have porn addiction, feel free to DM me if you want. I&amp;#39;m no professional but I&amp;#39;m ready to help!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
