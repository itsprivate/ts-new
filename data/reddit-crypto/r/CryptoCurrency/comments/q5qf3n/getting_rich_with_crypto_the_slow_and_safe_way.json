It is also stated that compound interest is the world&#39;s eighth wonder and the secret to prosperity (I’m not even sure if this was true or made.</p>\n\n<p>CeFi and DeFi is the reason for the surge of APY. It is now feasible to earn interest on cryptocurrency for the first time. There are risks, but it is a massive multiplier that may significantly increase your performance, and it would be a big miss of you not to consider it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For those curious, here are some of the ways to start compounding your crypto:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Staking your currency or tokens on your preferred protocol with your own private crypto wallet. Validating blocks is a common way to contribute to the chain&#39;s security. Examples: <a href=\"https://app.aave.com/\"><strong>ADA</strong></a>, <strong>AAVE</strong>.</li>\n<li>Decentralized or Centralized Lending via a crypto bank and let them compensate you for allowing the platform to retain or lock up your crypto. The mechanism is different in this case. You can often obtain great rates, but the downside is,  you are not in charge of your coins if something goes wrong. Examples are <a href=\"https://haruinvest.com/\"><strong>Haru Invest</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://celsius.network/rates/\"><strong>Celsius</strong></a>, and <strong>COMP</strong>.</li>\n<li>With LP Tokens. The biggest returns, but also has the most risk. Here you may put token pairs into a pool to be exchanged by users. <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\"><strong>UniSwap</strong></a> and <strong>Pancakeswap</strong> are two examples. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On its own, compound interest is fantastic. However, utilizing compound interest to collect additional units of an asset that is appreciating will drastically speed up the process.</p>\n\n<p>Some may argue that YES, these platforms are risky, and I agree that entrusting your funds to a custodian or a random smart contract is a risky proposition. However, compound interest over time has the potential to be an interesting breakthrough in this sector, and it may be safer than day trading. But only if you are brave enough. </p>\n\n<p>You CAN get rich in say, 5 months but the shorter the timespan, the higher the risk. And to contrast, you CAN get rich in 5 years but with the longer the timespan, then the risk is also lower. </p>\n\n<p>As always, it’s always highly recommended to DYOR into these platforms.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
