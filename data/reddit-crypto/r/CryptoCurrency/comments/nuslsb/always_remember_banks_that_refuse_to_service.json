During the bullrun this last January, they banned it completely.  No credit/debit/exchange purchases for crypto.  None, zip, zero. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54225572\">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54225572</a></p>\n\n<p>They let a fraudster running ponzi scheme continue with transactions even after they learned about the scam..lmao</p>\n\n<p>Also here... More Cartel money being laundered.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-documentary-re-examines-hsbcs-881-million-money-laundering-scandal-2018-02-21\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-documentary-re-examines-hsbcs-881-million-money-laundering-scandal-2018-02-21</a></p>\n\n<h3>Captial one</h3>\n\n<p>They also were very vocal about crypto being used for money laundering and other activities.  😆. They let some wire transactions on some exchanges but outright banned credit/debit purchases </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/capital-one-settles-with-fincen-over-anti-money-laundering-deficiencies-11610750699\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/capital-one-settles-with-fincen-over-anti-money-laundering-deficiencies-11610750699</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/capital-one-fined-290m-for-willful-anti-money-laundering-failures\">https://www.americanbanker.com/news/capital-one-fined-290m-for-willful-anti-money-laundering-failures</a></p>\n\n<p>Isn&#39;t that funny?  It seems that every powerful entity that says &quot;crypto bad&quot; is out there doing something illegal themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This can&#39;t be coincidence..   it&#39;s about control.  Why let the world FOMO into decentralized when they don&#39;t have control over it? Surely this hurts them somehow..</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s getting worse too. HSBC won&#39;t let you buy stock in a company if they hold Bitcoin. Lmao.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/hsbc-crypto-policy-bars-clients-buying-stock-companies-hold-bitcoin/\">https://news.bitcoin.com/hsbc-crypto-policy-bars-clients-buying-stock-companies-hold-bitcoin/</a></p>\n\n<p>So much for buying Tesla.   </p>\n\n<p>Just a bunch of dirtbags.    They just want control over the flow of currency.    </p>\n\n<p>Sadly they Don&#39;t teach kids to not blindly trust because the name brand is big.    Wouldn&#39;t want them to grow up, and look out for that.   That could hurt business.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
