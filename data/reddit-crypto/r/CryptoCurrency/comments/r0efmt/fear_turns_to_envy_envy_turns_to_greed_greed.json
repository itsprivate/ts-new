It will only end poorly for all involved. In my opinion, it is better to send them to Investopedia <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/crypto-primer-currencies-commodities-tokens/\">Beginner Link</a> and let them do research on their own and <strong>then maybe</strong> discuss investing in crypto once they know the risks. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even still, this can be risky.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>Fear</h3>\n\n<p>People are afraid of what they don&#39;t understand. They&#39;ll believe all of the FUD that the mainstream media pumps out about Crypto.</p>\n\n<h3>Fear -&gt; Envy</h3>\n\n<p>Even if they&#39;re afraid, they&#39;ll start to see that you&#39;re making money and that you have some &quot;secret recipe&quot; to crypto. They&#39;re going to ask you for more advice. Even though you don&#39;t &quot;know shit about fuck.&quot; You&#39;re going to know more than them and they&#39;re going to trust you.</p>\n\n<h3>Envy -&gt; Greed</h3>\n\n<p>They&#39;re going to do what all people do when they think they can make money. They&#39;re going to invest way more than they can afford to lose because they&#39;re greedy.</p>\n\n<h3>Greed -&gt; Hate</h3>\n\n<p>They&#39;re going to lose everything because they didn&#39;t do any research, used leverage, or FOMO&#39;d in at an all time high (ATH). They&#39;re never going to blame themselves, so they&#39;re going to find the person who dragged them into all of this.</p>\n\n<h3>Hate -&gt; Suffering</h3>\n\n<p>They&#39;re going to take it out on you, whether at family functions or by talking about you behind your back. This will make your life miserable.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>When the market goes up, they&#39;re smart for investing their money. When the market goes down, you dragged them into this. You literally can&#39;t win.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
