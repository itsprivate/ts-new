Yes, for the individual holder there will be solutions, but an industry has been massacred and the EU once more gave up the possibility to take a leading role in cutting edge technology in favour of massive over-regulation.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is also, as many people in other threats stated that the problem would be old bas**s clinging to power or boomers not understanding crypto/blockchain. Fact is, leading politicians, in this case, were for example Paul Tang (ok he is 54), but also a renowned economist from Spain Ernest Urtasun (40) and even a POC  Assita Kanko (42). The problem here are not old white males at least, the conservative PPE voted against all together but are socialists, social democrats, left-wing liberals and greens... a sad truth but a truth nonetheless&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please see the table below for detailed results of the final vote for the shady compromise on the law that doomed the crypto industry in the EU:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/byvm7rbewvq81.png?width=439&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0fa3249f0fcab37f941b07fd288adafcbf72e797\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/byvm7rbewvq81.png?width=439&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0fa3249f0fcab37f941b07fd288adafcbf72e797&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
