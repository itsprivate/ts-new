  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 5, a user made a post here on cryptocurrency about a new NFT game they “discovered”. The game has its own token on the Binance Smart Chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The post was swiftfully and rightfully deleted by the mods before it could do much damage, but not before it got to the frontpage of this sub.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/fEuukUf.png\"&gt;the post made it to the top&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, this was extremely suspicious because:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Upvotes are still hidden which means it’s a very new post&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It got to the top 8 posts of the sub when it was half an hour old then quickly kept going up from there&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It only had a few comments and more than ⅓  of them were from the OP&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally when a very young post makes it to the top of the frontpage, it has an insane level of engagement and high variety comments from other users gained in a super short time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this was not the case here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;I come from a marketing background and know firsthand how easy it is to “hack” social media platforms like reddit to make something go viral artificially.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally a few months ago, &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pqnd3s/i_did_a_little_digging_on_the_latest_shitcoin/\"&gt;I also found a network of paid accounts&lt;/a&gt; and bot accounts on reddit that crypto scammers use to boost their rugpull posts of new coins (you know the ones with titles like 🚀🚀 Anal Inu Coin 🚀🚀🌕 🌕).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just from the points above, I was 95% sure it was just a lost rugpuller who probably meant to post it on the other less-moderated crypto subreddits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This rugpuller had the audacity to pretend to be a new investor who had just “discovered” an amazing gem, so I wanted to dig a little more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Checking the user behind the post sealed the deal as a bought-for shiller&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s a screenshot of their &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/SkkTfjr\"&gt;post history&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/cblIPdB\"&gt;comment history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More suspicious things pop up here that says: this is 100% not a genuine person and this was not a genuine post:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Account had 0 post activity in 3 years&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Also 0 comment activity in 1 year&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Absolutely no crypto-related content in any comments of posts in the history of the account&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, the account comes out of the shadows and suddenly starts making posts about a new crypto game in multiple places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at their post and how they masqueraded as an innocent user who just wanted to share their discovery&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/TfhgkgH.png\"&gt;direct quotes from the post&lt;/a&gt; before it was deleted:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hey guys, just wanted to let you all know about this new Crypto Game called &amp;quot;Moonscape&amp;quot;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This first sentence of the post is not the language of someone who just discovered a game. This is the script of someone making a promotional video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is the first game launched on the Seascape Lighthouse IDO project, but made by a very successful team. Definitely worth checking out and for sure can 100X very quickly.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot of DDs and research pieces on this sub, and the only posts that compliment the devs but don’t give names or examples of what the devs actually accomplished are scam posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at how genuine newbies post and talk here, they all ask if a project is legit. They don’t confidently guarantee lambos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Moonscape is a resource strategy management #DeFi NFT Game that takes place on a futuristic moon. Players scramble for limited resources to develop their burgeoning cities.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only people who use hashtags in new coin posts are the rugpullers behind the new coin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;*“The game will be brower based, with phone apps coming later in the year. Direct payment to moonscape token will also be availble in the game at a later date the devs have stated. Please keep an eye out for this one, its going to be masive.”\n*\nMore marketing-derived language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, if the game hasn’t launched yet how did the user discover it? Lmao&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“MSCP Token is a BSC token and availble on Pancake swap, but i think the native token is on the Moonriver network. You can use the meter.passport to swap fro m BSC to moonriver which will enable you to stake the coins. I believe staking is around 70% at the moment, and you can take your coins out whenever you want without penalty. Moonriver is part of the Moonbeam network on Kusama I belive.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More language that looks lifted from a brochure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time they added “I think” and “I believe” because they’re a third party and totally not affiliated with it. They’re 100% impartial and are just guessing things. Sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;“Id be happy to answer any questions if you have any as well :)”*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They got their message mixed up here in the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of new investor who just discovered a “massive” project is confident enough to take questions? If they know so much, why did they talk about the specifics in the previous section with such uncertainty?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;They also kept up the charade in the comments and had lots of replies to innocent users&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do these sound like they came from someone who’s impartial to the completely new not launched yet project they just discovered?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/9qblSaW.png\"&gt;OP sure knows a lot about this game&lt;/a&gt; that hasn’t launched yet for someone who’s not involved in it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Telling people to &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/5k07B43.png\"&gt;send you PMs&lt;/a&gt; is always a sure fire way to convince them you’re not a scammer yes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apparently &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gCtmbMc.png\"&gt;100x returns is realistic and genuine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s honestly hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s like they started with a genius idea to pretend to be a normal person, but abandoned it halfway through their post then went all in on shilling in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;TLDR&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scammers, shillers, rugpullers have a network of accounts to boost their posts to the top of subreddits, including here on /cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be mindful of the language in the post and look into the user before you believe anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
