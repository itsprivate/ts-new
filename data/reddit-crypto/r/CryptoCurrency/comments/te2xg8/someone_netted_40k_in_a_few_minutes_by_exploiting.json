Anyways, the idea is not that hard, which is to look for price when the stable veers away from 1.00.  Also important to look for one with high enough liquidity.  I found this article here &lt;a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/12/first-mover-how-a-defi-trader-made-an-89-profit-in-minutes-slinging-stablecoins/\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; a very fascinating read - in summary this is what happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically someone started out with 45K USDC and then borrowed another 400K. Then setup a bot to look for temporary differences in UST from 1 dollar.  When the opportunity arose the trader then used Uniswap to exchange 450 USDC for 492 USDT, instantly netting 42 K.  When it it eventually dropped back to 1.00 which he/she then swapped back to USDC.  The total transaction fee was only 2K, netting 40K, not bad for a day of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This story was written up here. &lt;a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/12/first-mover-how-a-defi-trader-made-an-89-profit-in-minutes-slinging-stablecoins/\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;.  In the article they also showed the transaction details detailing exactly each of the transactions.  incidentally is another reason why blockchains are great because all records can be easily observed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importantly this was completely legal and was not unethical&lt;/strong&gt; because the trader only took advantage  of the price difference which is similar to buying low at one place and selling it somewhere else for a higher price. Arbitrage is standard practice only in this instant its done with stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
