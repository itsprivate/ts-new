I used to have $600 back in 2015 and was suggested to buy BTC by my friends. Sadly I decided to by a new laptop instead (which broke years ago). Today, I have found some rather interesting deal. The sad part is that I am going to miss it again because I am too poor to afford the starting bid prices but I am just sharing in case someone in the sub might be interested. </p>\n\n<p>There is this website called <strong>GSA Auctions</strong>. It is an Auctions Website which specializes in selling Proprietary surplus, Government obsolete properties, as well as seized items from police. It is like a giant thrift shop online and most listing offerings are based in USA. I have used the site for several months now and its a goldmine! You&#39;ll find dirt cheap stuff (in my case, printer toner in new packaging) everywhere although you have to plan the shipping of the items because they don&#39;t ship to your doorstep.</p>\n\n<p>Today is rather curious because I discovered that THEY ARE NOW SELLING BTC which I&#39;m going to assume that these are seized assets from some shady criminal somewhere.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/84q8aihou1v71.jpg?width=2281&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d62f25752c7bce1b5ea5a9c0b4375e37a52af3f\">Fall for Cryptocurrency - GSA Auctions</a></p>\n\n<p>On October 26-28, 2021, there is this event called Fall for Cryptocurrency on which they plan to publicly sell about 5 BTC. For anyone interested here is the link: <a href=\"https://gsaauctions.gov\">https://gsaauctions.gov</a></p>\n\n<p>If you are too lazy to open a new tab, I&#39;ve summarized the offerings below:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>FIRST LOT: 0.44 BTC with a starting bid of $11 971</strong></li>\n<li><strong>SECOND LOT: 0.75 BTC with a starting bid of $20 405</strong></li>\n<li><strong>THIRD LOT: 1.00 BTC with a starting bid of $27 206</strong></li>\n<li><strong>FOURTH LOT: 1.25 BTC with a starting bid of $34 008</strong></li>\n<li><strong>FIFTH LOT: 1.50 BTC with a starting bid of $40 809</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>PS: I am in no way, shape or form affiliated with GSA Governement Auctions. I am just a poor ADA staker who daydreams about owning a lambo.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bd2kk040y1v71.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d7066ddce934c81f082214d2d033b9899d3b175\">Summary of offerings</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
