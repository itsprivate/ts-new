There’s the fact that some cryptos have a limited supply just like Bitcoin. Other coins are untraceable like Monero and are great for privacy and DeFi is decentralized and safe from government interference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But out of all features that will later prove crypto more superior than fiat, I think that low transfer fees is what will bring in new people initially and make crypto go mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m saying this is cause I’m seeing it in my own eyes. I live in a country where a lot of young people live abroad and help their families out with extra cash end of month.\nWestern Union here is HELLA EXPENSIVE so I’m seeing a lot of people who have never had any encounter with crypto before open a wallet and start using platforms like Binance and E-Money cause of the ultra low fees and fast transfers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying other features in crypto aren’t important. In fact I think limited supply and decentralization are much more important features. I’m just saying that low fees is what will most likely attract the largest number of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
