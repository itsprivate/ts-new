  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a post last day advising people to be either a trader or an investor and god did it get some crazy reactions!\nHalf of you said we are both. Another half were pissed (don&amp;#39;t tell us what to do!). Out of five hundred comments and more , only a handful understood what I was actually saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me elaborate:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A trader is someone who is trading on daily basis. A trader does not give a damn if it is bear market or bull market. And only like two people said it in comments. When you say  &amp;quot;I am part trader and part investor, I invest in ETH and buy shitcoins for quick bucks&amp;quot; , you mean that you want something that go up a considerable amount to &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; sell it. \nLet me break it up to you. It is called short term investment! A trader can trade BTC or ETH or any other asset with enough price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A treader will not go around saying: I bought this much Shib but it is now down 30% so I will hold till it go back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He will sell &amp;quot;the moment&amp;quot; he understands that market movement is downward. Ofc a trader might have a wallet with some BTC for long term investment in it but he/she is still a trader. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can confidently say that less than 1% of people in this sub are traders. You know why? Because traders are extremely busy trading. And &amp;quot;they know shit&amp;quot;. I am not a trader but some of my friends are , and they don&amp;#39;t have time for their children&amp;#39;s birthday party.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;it is impossible to do both.&amp;quot;\nRather &amp;quot;it is impossible to be both.&amp;quot;\nWhy? Because you need to have two separate mindsets. And in the end one mindset is much more dominant. And we are not skilled enough to be both. At least most of us are not. As some of you put it correctly many of us have a &amp;quot;third mentality&amp;quot; which didn&amp;#39;t came to my mind while writing that post. Most of us are neither a trader bor an investor but rather a &amp;quot;gambler&amp;quot;. \nWhy? Because as I told you before traders don&amp;#39;t give a fuck about market&amp;#39;s general trend. And investors are usually extremely calculative and patient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me. You were right! We are gamblers.\nIt explains everything!\nThat is why we try to quit when we lose money but we always come back.\nThat is why we have like hundred posts here everyday calling the whole cryptomarket a big scam and this is why the same people will go on buying Elonsperm &amp;quot;anyway&amp;quot;.\nThat is why everyone here is pissed when market is red and in a good mood when it is green.\nIsn&amp;#39;t these acts remind you of something?\nLike a gambler who had a bad day at casino?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems we are far far away from choosing between being a trader or an investor.\nFor now it is a great step forward if we quit gamblers mindset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Respect to you all\nVve&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
