What a crazy thing. It costs close to nothing to mint and put an NFT for sale. This is a complete game changer for artists in animation or music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The MyAlgo wallet that Ive been using since a few days ago is really innovative too. No programs running on your device, it simply works in your browser via cookies (I assume?). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I admit, I was really wrong about you guys being super excited for Algo but you cant really blame me after all the disastrous projects that were shilled around here. I&amp;#39;m keeping my eyes on this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
