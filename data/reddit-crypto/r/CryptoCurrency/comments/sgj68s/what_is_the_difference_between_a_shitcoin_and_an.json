If it was called a funny name, would it be a shitcoin or is it because it&amp;#39;s not meme based it&amp;#39;s an alt? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monero for instance, I can see why this is popular due to its privacy and as far as I can see I&amp;#39;d the only coin that has this feature, however quite a few alt coins I&amp;#39;ve checked out don&amp;#39;t seem to be any different than shitcoins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very confusing. Or is it all just a matter of opinon?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: 6 people have told me I&amp;#39;m an idiot because of my ADA comment, yet not one ahs explained to me it&amp;#39;s use case. Calling me an idiot or a troll isn&amp;#39;t helping your case is it? I read their website and it&amp;#39;s nothing but vague roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a dig just a mere observation, please teach me if I&amp;#39;m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: Wow some of you are so angry and bitchy, are y&amp;#39;all ok in here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
