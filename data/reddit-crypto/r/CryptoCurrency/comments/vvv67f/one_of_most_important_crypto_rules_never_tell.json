  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is rule many people forgot about especially in bear market. In bull market most people protect their profits, but during bear market a lot of people like to share their losses. Problem is when bull market will come back you will have target on your back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you need share loses or gains use %,  just tell my portfolio is 70% down or 30% up, not how much  it is  worth. People can do math. Also not tell how much you made, just tell your coin did x10, let people guess if you invested $10 or $20k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never share any financial details of your portfolio outside reddit too. You think messenger, SMS, e-mails or some other social media are safe? Do not even write notes on phone&amp;#39;s notebook with exact details. If anyone will hack your phone they will have access to all those things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same rule applies in real life. A lot of people like to  brag about their crypto profits, later they are often find dead with hole in the head... And I am not even joking, there were many articles about those situations, especially in bad neighbourhoods, everyone who is here long enough remember them. Even if you won&amp;#39;t be  dead, your family &amp;amp; friends and strangers may ask you for money, become jealous or angry. Someone you know or person that overhead may also broke into your home and then nothing will help if they will find your seed phrases or stole your device with access to wallets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never tell % if people can check even single of your coins to guesss value. It is especially  important in case of moons. If you tell how much % of your portfolio moons are...suprise... suprise everyone can calculate value of your whole portfolio. Simmilar situation if anyone know your wallet adress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you blur $ value of coins on photo you share most often it is still possible to restore it by playing with contrast. You either need to cut part of photo entirely or not share it at all. Some exchanges give you also option to hide $balance which may also help if you really need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in crypto long enough, I saw people that shared details of huge portfolios, I also saw countless cases of people losing huge porftolios for whatever reasons. Maybe some of them wouldn&amp;#39;t lose their crypto if they would be quiet. Don&amp;#39;t be like them, even if risk is minimal or your portfolio is small do not worth to took unnecessary risk by  sharing any financial details.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
