Despite not being able to show much yet, he says &quot;<em>we  are at the final stages of a large government contract which would have  multimillion users being onboarded into the platform for a real world  blockchain implementation...</em>&quot;. The project will be a decentralized  identity solution based on the Cardano blockchain that will allow people  to own their personal data and interact with organizations seamlessly,  privately and securely*,* which would be, in O&#39;Connor&#39;s words, &quot;<em>...the largest</em> (real world use case) <em>blockchain deployment done anywhere</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The article also mentions a second project in Tanzania close to being  finalized. This project will focus on providing Internet access to  people who do not have it.</p>\n\n<p>IOG  planning to attract 100 million users in the first stage of these  projects from countries like Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya and  Nigeria</p>\n\n<p>P.S: It won&#39;t let me post the link to the article</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
