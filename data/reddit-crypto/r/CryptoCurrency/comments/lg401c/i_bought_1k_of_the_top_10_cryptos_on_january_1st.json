Speaking of <strong>Stellar</strong>, it joins <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and <strong>Ethereum</strong> as one of only three cryptos to have at least broken even since January 1st, 2018.  <strong>Cardano</strong> and <strong>Litecoin</strong> seemed to be next in line.</p>\n\n<h1>Question of the month month: <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> added approximately how many new members in January 2021?</h1>\n\n<p>A) 225,000</p>\n\n<p>B) 500,000</p>\n\n<p>C) One for every recycled meme</p>\n\n<p>D) One for every Elon Musk mention</p>\n\n<p><em>Scroll down for the answer.</em></p>\n\n<h2>January Ranking, Movement Report, and Dropouts</h2>\n\n<p>Despite a strong month overall, most of the movement in January was downward except for <strong>Cardano</strong> (up two spots to #6) and <strong>Stellar</strong> (up four spots to #11).  </p>\n\n<p>All other cryptos either held ground or fell: <strong>NEM</strong> slipped two to #20, <strong>Litecoin</strong> fell three slots to #8, and <strong>BCH</strong> fell three places and is now in danger of dropping out of the Top Ten.</p>\n\n<p>And <strong>Dash</strong>, man, is having a rough couple of months.  After falling six spots and out of the Top <em>Thirty</em> <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-3-year-report/\">last month</a>, <strong>Dash</strong> dropped an additional eleven places in January and is now out of the Top <em>Forty</em>.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ywkrvd0sjgg61.png?width=454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f48de5cdc9853aef5424c39305c78c27809ec573\">Dash - first crypto of any Experiment year to sink below #40</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:</strong> After thirty seven of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, 40% of the cryptos that<a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\"> started in the Top Ten</a> have dropped out.  <strong>NEM, Dash, IOTA</strong>, and <strong>Stellar</strong> have been replaced by <strong>Binance Coin, Tether</strong>, <strong>LINK</strong>, and most recently, <strong>DOT</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, even with different players, this is the same dropout rate (40%) as the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-25\">2019 Top Ten Portfolio</a>. And the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-13\">2020 Top Ten Experiment</a> group has performed only marginally better (70% remaining/30% dropout rate).  One month in, the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1\">2021 Top Ten Cryptos</a> remain locked in place.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>For trivia night: Ethereum</strong> is the only Top Ten crypto that has climbed in rank since January 2018.</p>\n\n<h2>January Winners and Losers</h2>\n\n<p><strong><em>January Winners</em></strong> –  Gaining +139% and picking up four places in the rankings, <strong>Stellar</strong> dominated January.  <strong>Cardano</strong> also performed extremely well, up +126% in one month.   </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>January Losers</em></strong> –  The L goes to <strong>Litecoin</strong> this month.  While finishing in the green, its +5% gain underperformed the field.  Second worst performer was <strong>Dash</strong>, gaining +6% and falling eleven places in the rankings.</p>\n\n<h2>Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers</h2>\n\n<p>After thirty seven months, the table below gives a good sense of the winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/thj70zn1kgg61.png?width=429&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e853aa46f506836b77aa48f1070644e00fd5186a\">https://preview.redd.it/thj70zn1kgg61.png?width=429&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e853aa46f506836b77aa48f1070644e00fd5186a</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is clearly dominant with the most monthly wins (10).  A bit less obvious, <strong>Cardano</strong> has the second most victories, amassing  6 monthly wins in just over three years. <strong>NEM</strong> has lost 8 months, the most out of the 2018 Top Ten Cryptos. And <strong>Bitcoin</strong> is unique as the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t lost a month yet since January 2018 (although it has come close a couple of times).</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Update – BTC, ETH, and XLM only cryptos in green, overall portfolio breaks -25%, and Dash in last place.</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f9ftjeh4kgg61.png?width=1051&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c3f08231ba0ab8dc33ecdb728a8446fd4703216\">Welcome to the green, XLM!</a></p>\n\n<p>The 2018 Top Ten portfolio as a whole? <em>Down -25% since January 2018.</em></p>\n\n<p>But! But things are starting to move very quickly with the 2018 Top Ten.  Over the last few months, the entire portfolio has been rapidly approaching break even point: <strong><em>the 2018 Top Ten were down -75% November 1st, then -50% January 1st, now -25% on February 1st</em></strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>At this rate we will (hopefully, finally) get back to break-even point in the next few months after over three years of waiting. </p>\n\n<p>This long awaited progress is thanks mainly to <strong>BTC</strong> (+155%) and <strong>ETH</strong> (+89%) gains since January 2018.</p>\n\n<p><strong>XLM</strong> has now joined the 2018 break-even club.  It seems like the next two dominos to fall are <strong>ADA</strong> and <strong>Litecoin</strong>, but we’ll have to see. </p>\n\n<p>-25% is another psychologically important milestone for 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and represents the second highest overall return since the Experiment began.  Only the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">very first update</a> reported less of a loss (-20%). </p>\n\n<p>Check out the Monthly ROI a few tables below for a bird’s eye view of the 2018 Top Ten ROI journey.  Spoiler alert: it’s been mostly painful, until recently.</p>\n\n<p>At the bottom are a couple of cryptos that have lost nearly 90% of their value since January 2018: <strong>Dash</strong> is down -89% and <strong>IOTA</strong> has lost -88% over the life of the experiment. The initial $100 invested in <strong>Dash</strong> thirty seven months ago is worth $10.35 today.</p>\n\n<h2>Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8hamoshakgg61.png?width=851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75237eb3b1d27095c2cc1acf100f0d515ee52647\">A trilly a trilly a trilly a trilly!</a></p>\n\n<p>Ah, that’s a pretty picture: for the first time ever, the entire crypto market cap finished a month over the $1 trillion (with a T) mark.</p>\n\n<p>The total crypto market cap added $232B in January.  For the third month in a row this represents <em>a higher level than when the 2018 Experiment started three years ago</em>. Up +75% since January 2018, it is now crushing the 41% return of the S&amp;P over the same time period. Much more on that below.</p>\n\n<h2>Bitcoin dominance:</h2>\n\n<p>After finishing 2020 way up at 70.4% (barely below the Experiment record level of 70.5% in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/\">September 2019</a>), <strong>BitDom</strong> came back down to earth a bit, finishing the first month of 2021 at 62.2%. If you’re new to the space, <strong>Bitcoin Dominance</strong> is a helpful figure to keep your eye on:  a falling <strong>BitDom</strong> percentage means Alts are ascendant.</p>\n\n<p>For context, since the<a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\"> beginning of the experiment</a>, the range of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> dominance has been very wide: from the current 70% high to a low of 33% in the first month of the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">2018 Experiment</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: </h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zmptwamekgg61.png?width=355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f545a827c06cfc9c34d925f6cd5b837391f040e1\">Almost...there (stay on target).  Almost...there...</a></p>\n\n<p>The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio gained about $235 bucks (+24%) in January, by far one of the strongest months since the Experiment began thirty-seven months ago.  You’d have to go back to  <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-four/\">April 2018</a> (+26%) to find a better month-end gain.  </p>\n\n<p>If I decided to pull the plug on the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, <strong>the $1000 initial investment would return about $748</strong>, down -25% from<a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\"> January 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re just joining, you might find it hard to believe that I feel fantastic about being down only -25% after over three years of running the 2018 Top Ten Experiment.  But take a look at the trajectory:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>November 1st, 2020: down -75%</li>\n<li>January 1st, 2021: down -49%</li>\n<li>February 1st, 2021: down -25% </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Breaking even and even profiting on this portfolio now seems inevitable.  Just a matter of when, not if.</p>\n\n<p>This confidence is not characteristic of most of this journey.  The road has been long and oftentimes seemed hopeless.  Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, over the last three+ years:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oguem1ujkgg61.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11789faec8da2cabc45d0aec7e00f839a56595d8\">ROI summary = 37 months of red</a></p>\n\n<p>Check out the absolute bottom, back in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/\">-88%</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For those just entering the space, hopefully this gives you some perspective as you start your crypto journey.  </p>\n\n<h2>Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios</h2>\n\n<p>So the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is on its way up, but still down -25%. After investing another $1000 in the Top Ten in <strong><em>2019</em></strong> and <strong><em>2020</em></strong> (<a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1\">and just recently, again for 2021!</a>), how are the other Experiments holding up?  Let’s take a look:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-37\">2018 Top Ten Experiment</a>: down -25% (total value $748)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-25\">2019 Top Ten Experiment</a>: up +260% (total value $3,595)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-13\">2020 Top Ten Experiment</a>: up +223% (total value $3,227)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1\">2021 Top Ten Experiment</a>: up +51% (total value $1,509)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom <em>bottom</em> line: </p>\n\n<p><strong>After a $4000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,</strong> the combined portfolios are worth <strong>$9,079</strong> ($748+ $3,595 +$3,227+$1,509).</p>\n\n<p><strong>That’s up +127%</strong> on the combined portfolios.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table to help visualize:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/alqqm76pkgg61.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=415065670cdd4c2d2b6fe8948ce6e671d0fee56f\">https://preview.redd.it/alqqm76pkgg61.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=415065670cdd4c2d2b6fe8948ce6e671d0fee56f</a></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>That’s an +127% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years</em></strong>. This is the highest ROI since I started tracking this metric last year.</p>\n\n<h2>Top Ten Approach vs. All-In Approach</h2>\n\n<p>But surely I would have done even better if I went all in on one crypto, right? </p>\n\n<p>Depends on your choice!  Let’s take a look.  </p>\n\n<p>I can’t do this for all 8,413 cryptocurrencies, but there are five cryptos have begun each of the last four years in the Top Ten: <strong>BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,</strong> and <strong>LTC</strong>. Which one would have returned the most if I didn’t go for an Index approach?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mqomt9mukgg61.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3132eaf4813de90aed9ab7b03d612103bb233861\">Even the worst performer of the 4 year club outperforms the S&amp;P</a></p>\n\n<p>Since I started tracking this metric a few months ago, there’s been a bit of a back and forth between <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and <strong>Ethereum.</strong>  This month? </p>\n\n<p><strong>ETH</strong>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l-QVmsqetB8\">on top</a>, by a landslide.  $4,000 into Ethereum in $1k chunks once a year would now be worth a staggering <strong>$24,645</strong>. That’s up +722%.</p>\n\n<p>In second place, going all in on <strong>Bitcoin</strong> with $4,000 USD would have yielded +482%, turning the initial investment into $17,450.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>XRP</strong>, would have been the worst four year all-in bet, at +57%.  But even that is more than double the return from traditional markets (more on that below).</p>\n\n<p>And the Top Ten Index Fund approach?  </p>\n\n<p>As you might expect, as indexes are designed to mitigate risk, the +127% gains of the Top Ten Index Fund approach fall somewhere in between.  The Top Ten strategy isn’t keeping up with ETH, BTC, or LTC, but it is outperforming a hypothetical all-in investment in both XRP and BCH by a healthy margin.</p>\n\n<h2>Comparison to S&amp;P 500:</h2>\n\n<p>I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The S&amp;P 500 Index stalled a bit in January, but is still near all time high levels. It is up +41% since January 2018. </p>\n\n<p>The initial $1k investment into crypto on<a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\"> January 1st, 2018</a> would have been worth about $1410 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P. That holds up very well compared to the $748 return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund.</p>\n\n<p>But what if I took the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method? </p>\n\n<p>Here are the numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1410 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1510 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1170 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1005 today</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom <em>bottom</em> line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: </p>\n\n<p><strong>After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,095.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That is up <strong>+27%</strong> <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">since January 2018</a> compared to a <strong>+127%</strong> gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 100 percentage points <strong><em>in favor of crypto.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>You can compare against five individual coins (<strong>BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,</strong> and <strong>LTC)</strong> by using the table above if you want. </p>\n\n<p>The key takeaway?</p>\n\n<p>Using a similar investing strategy, the S&amp;P 500 is currently underperforming <strong>XRP</strong>, <strong>Bitcoin Cash, BTC, ETH, LTC</strong> <em>and</em> the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio approach.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table summarizing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4qsi5336lgg61.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc722b8d7da86fd422eaa99a483c42613f02ea5\">That&#39;s a nice, big gap, crypto</a></p>\n\n<p>The momentum is clearly on crypto’s side and the 100% gap is the largest since I’ve been tracking this metric, even with stocks at all time highs.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n<p>Despite some GameStop and Doge distractions (or maybe because of them?) the 2018 Top Ten had an extremely strong start to 2021, especially compared to traditional markets.  Getting back to -25% feels like a milestone, something that seemed impossible only a few months ago.</p>\n\n<p>It was great to see <strong>Stellar</strong> join <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and <strong>Ethereum</strong> in the green this month.  Hopefully some of the other cryptos will be able to claw themselves back up to break-even point and beyond.  2021 is off to a strong start, it should be a very interesting year for crypto.</p>\n\n<p>To both new and long time Experiment followers: thanks so much for reading and for supporting the project, I hope you’ve found them helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. </p>\n\n<p>Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.
