That maximum damage is still yet to come.  Nobody on this sub or anywhere else for that matter actually knows where the price will go.  If it&amp;#39;s so obvious that bitcoin is going below 10k, why aren&amp;#39;t you shorting it right now?  Why haven&amp;#39;t you sold everything you have?  Why aren&amp;#39;t the people who are far more knowledgeable, experienced and invested than you dumping since it&amp;#39;s so obvious that BTC is going to 10k?  Seems like an easy way to profit, since it&amp;#39;s so certain, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not.  We could have already hit bottom.  Truth is, nobody knows.  Even if we aren&amp;#39;t at the bottom yet, here&amp;#39;s the fate of 99% of investors on this sub:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; BTC drops further.  &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t maximum damage yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; BTC drops further.  You don&amp;#39;t buy because you&amp;#39;re too afraid that if you do, it will dip more.  You&amp;#39;re afraid that it&amp;#39;s not the bottom yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; BTC drops to staggering lows, everyone is panicking, articles doomsaying the end of crypto are published, the suicide hotline is pinned.  Looks damn close to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You don&amp;#39;t buy, because now you&amp;#39;re afraid this is the end of crypto as we know it.  The rug has been pulled, everything is going to zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Crypto rallies and begins surging in price.  It multiples in value several times before you can react.  &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just a dead cat bounce&amp;quot; you think, or some other stupid shit like that.  So you continue to be afraid, and you don&amp;#39;t buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Crypto is up 5-10x from the bottom and you FOMO in on the way up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Institutions dump on you again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
