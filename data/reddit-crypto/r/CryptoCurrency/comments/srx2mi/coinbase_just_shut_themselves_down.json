The mainstream events are now glaringly obvious and cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if we continue the winter, adoption is picking up tremendously. Looking forward to seeing the next crypto commercial. Let’s go!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: it was only down about 5 minutes but that doesn’t change anything about welcoming all these newbs with a righteous downed server.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
