  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone still living in 1995, it might be too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But anyone who&amp;#39;s been using a smart phone, going online, and doing online banking, will find using crypto no more difficult than anything else they&amp;#39;ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How hard is it to use crypto for a purchase?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you know how to use a smart phone, then making a crypto purchase with a phone isn&amp;#39;t gonna be rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as simple as anything else you do on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s very similar to using Paypal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Select either &amp;quot;send&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;receive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scan the QR code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enter the amount. And click send. Done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rcng1bsbfn191.png?width=250&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6481ccf7f7b64c79126be94612f6e1d35b3505df\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/rcng1bsbfn191.png?width=250&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6481ccf7f7b64c79126be94612f6e1d35b3505df&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same process if you just want to transfer from wallet to wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re on a desktop, instead of a QR code, you would copy and paste an address. And double check the first and last digits to make sure it&amp;#39;s correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But is it hard to setup the wallet? It&amp;#39;s the same process as setting up any phone app you get from the Google or Apple store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How hard is it to get crypto?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the old days, we used ATMs a lot more. You can still use them, they&amp;#39;re very easy. You put your cash, and it spits out a paper wallet with a QR code, which you can then go home and transfer to either your phone wallet, or go on your computer and transfer from the paper wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can still do that today, but most people now use exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Exchanges.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the old days you had to be a little more at a crypto-nerd level, or experienced in trading stocks, to more easily make sense on how to trade crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since 2016, with Coinbase and many exchanges coming in with simplified and very accessible app, it offered an app that anyone who knows how to use a computer and a browser, can easily setup and use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even my dad in his 70s is using it now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s just as easy as setting up an online bank account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And on exchanges like Coinbase, you don&amp;#39;t even have to look at any charts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You select the crypto you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Select the amount.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Select where the funds come from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Review your purchase, then buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mm94c1vihn191.jpg?width=720&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42bb3b1a1113636e511e9fe76f2470779da28c31\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mm94c1vihn191.jpg?width=720&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42bb3b1a1113636e511e9fe76f2470779da28c31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even making a limit buy, and select the amount you want to buy at, is easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are actually fewer steps than an Amazon online purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;But grandma, and even a lot of average Joes don&amp;#39;t understand how crypto works, or what a blockchain is.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they probably also don&amp;#39;t understand how Paypal or online banking works behind the scenes. I doubt they would even know how a server works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much less how a modern bank actually works. Do any of them know how fractional reserve banking works? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And many of them don&amp;#39;t even know how money works. The decision making behind the dollar, along with the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people still believe the dollar is backed by gold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That ignorance hasn&amp;#39;t stopped people from using it just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Where is the idea that crypto is hard coming from?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From 3 places:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- There are advanced features that can be a little more difficult. Like creating more advanced wallets. Using more advanced features. Doing more advanced trading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to become a miner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things an average Joe probably won&amp;#39;t get into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But things like advanced trading isn&amp;#39;t really more difficult than using e-Trade. And setting up a hardware wallet is still far from rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a miner takes some learning like learning any new hobby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- The difficulty in understanding how blockchain and crypto works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like understanding any software and technology, it will take some learning. Monetary systems, commodities, investment, can be a little complicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Economics has a lot of dynamics to understand. It&amp;#39;s the same with understanding tokenomics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s the same difficulty as understanding the stock markets, how stocks work, and how the economy works, when you&amp;#39;re an investor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3- It used to be more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the notions come from how it used to be in the old days. A little less user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of that has changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the notions that crypto is some complicated nerd money used by hackers, are outdated, and mostly coming from exaggerations by the media.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
