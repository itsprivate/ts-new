So why even spend the whole day looking at the charts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that now it’s the perfect time for accumulating, but you can keep with your weekly/monthly DCA without spending your whole day at crypto charts. Mental Health is vital, and especially when you’re losing huge amounts of money. Everybody will be talking now about Bitcoin falling below the previous market cycle top, but you will thank yourself later if you take a break from social media and crypto charts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Go out with your family/friends and enjoy this summer, I promise when you come back crypto won’t be gone. Focus on your mental health in these hard times and keep doing your DCA in BTC/ETH.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
