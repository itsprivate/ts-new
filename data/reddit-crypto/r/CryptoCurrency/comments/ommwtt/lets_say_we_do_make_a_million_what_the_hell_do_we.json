This is just hypothetical so don&#39;t message me.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: some good advice in a short amount of time mainly being:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hire a good accountant to sort out any taxes / worries. (You should be able to Hire a decent one if you made a mil)</li>\n<li>Stake your crypto and live off of the interest by withdrawing X amount a month (quite like this idea)</li>\n<li>Withdraw small increments each month</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: This blew up way more than I thought it would and there is some very valuable takeaways within the comments. You are right, a million isn&#39;t a lot these days but I was curious how I would go about withdrawing a substantial amount it wasn&#39;t necessarily my entire portfolio it was just a hypothetical scenario to see what measures and precautions myself and others would have to face. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for all the comments and I for one will be getting  my head down to read more into this!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
