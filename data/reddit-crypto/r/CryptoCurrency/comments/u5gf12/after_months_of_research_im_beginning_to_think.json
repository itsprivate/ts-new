After all this research I&amp;#39;ve come to the conclusion that crypto currencies are the future and possibly or only Chance at surviving the upcoming economic collapse.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes I said economic collapse, I know some of you might think I&amp;#39;m crazy for believing that the world&amp;#39;s trusted governments are steering us in the wrong direction but I believe it&amp;#39;s true.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take Bitcoin for example, this thing could really take off. I know it&amp;#39;s not very well regarded now and many believe it&amp;#39;s only for illegal activities but if you look beyond that it could have real uses as a hedge against inflation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also another newer crypto called Ethereum, this could possibly change the way the world works.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look into these if you get a Chance, I know it sounds crazy but this magic internet money is the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
