If we take the history we all know that every time inflation peaks the markets finds the bottom. You can check the data of previous crashes and make some conclusions. This is not advice, but if you’re in the group that thinks that “history repeats itself” it could be a good idea to wait a few months until the stock market and the crypto market dumps again and find a better enter position.\nOn the other side, I think that is not a bad idea to start a DCA strategy since we are really low in prices right now, specially BTC and ETH. I’m sure they will dump in the future, but maybe not enough to try to time the bottom.\nAnyways, this year can be a great opportunity to buy if you believe in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
