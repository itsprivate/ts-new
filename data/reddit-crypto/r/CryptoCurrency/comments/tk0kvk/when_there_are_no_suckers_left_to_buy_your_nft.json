It’s gambling, but you’re going to lose because you are not smarter than the fox. The reason why you hear celebrities buying expensive NFTS, is because that is called “marketing” and they were probably paid to say they bought it for $$$$$$ and were given a free NFT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t fall for this crap. There are more shit apes out there than ever. This is how you lose money. If you do happen to have a sucker on the line SELL IT. No one ever lost taking profits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice, only opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
