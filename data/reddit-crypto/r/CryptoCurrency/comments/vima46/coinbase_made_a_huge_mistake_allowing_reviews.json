Why the hell would you create the ability for people to review a shitcoin? Get on your CB mobile app and look yourself at how stupid and pointless the “reviews” are. All the reviews seem to be are people posting rocketship emojis and outright lying and saying whatever to get a bag pumped. It’s like discord groups pick a crypto (as we already know they do) to pump but now the process is on crack bc they can post “reviews” and verbalize the process to try and get innocent people to buy in. It’s toxic as hell and makes the company look terrible. Like wtf CB!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
