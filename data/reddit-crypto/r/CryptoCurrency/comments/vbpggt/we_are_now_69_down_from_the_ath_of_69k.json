I actually paused mine on Friday because of Gemini stopping free withdrawals, which turned out to be a bit of a lucky break because of this weekend crash, but I might start back up again at the end of this week on a different platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point in time, though, people would probably be better off keeping an eye on global equities news rather than crypto news. This thing won&amp;#39;t get any better until the macro stuff is sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:In other news, Bitcoin dominance actually fell today, which is surprising. But Bitcoin + stablecoin dominance went UP. Maybe this crypto winter is the one where BTC.D stays below 60% because people are keeping their money into USDC and DAI instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
