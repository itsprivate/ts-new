Cant find anything on <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">/r/CryptoCurrency</a> (my apologies if I missed a post about this already on here, but..you know.... reddit search)</p>\n\n<p>Found this post on <a href=\"/r/TREZOR\">/r/TREZOR</a> saying its a definite scam: <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/lun0l8/fake_trezor_ios_app/\">https://np.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/lun0l8/fake_trezor_ios_app/</a></p>\n\n<p>Then checked Trezor.io and found</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>iOS\nTrezor Wiki/Glossary/Trezor/Common device terms/ IOS\niOS is the mobile operating system by Apple. Use of your Trezor device on iOS is currently not (yet) supported.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re on iOS please go to the app store and report it.</p>\n\n<p>I can only imagine being a semi-noob and not being as vigilant or aware of the warning signs and getting all my shit stolen.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The app is just called &quot;Trezor&quot;, I didnt want to link incase a bot flips its shit.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I just worked out that the age being 4+ is the age rating, not the age of the app</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: Its 6 hours since I wrote this post and it looks like the app is off the store. I can’t see it anymore but if you’ve downloaded it I think you can still report. I couldn’t figure out how to report so emailed apple support and don’t really expect a response. </p>\n\n<p>Check the link of the other post above from <a href=\"/r/Trezor\">r/Trezor</a> and you can see what the app looked like incase it reappears.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
