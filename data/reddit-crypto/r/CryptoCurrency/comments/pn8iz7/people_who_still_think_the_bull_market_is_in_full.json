There is always a strong recovery rally (essentially a bull trap) after every major drop off, have another look at 2017 and 2013 for reference. Assets almost always don’t collapse straight away, it’s always hard to see when you’re in the moment of what exactly is happening. Bull markets are full of constant higher highs and treading above the 21 Week SMA, it’s just time and time again history repeats itself and we haven’t had a higher high for months. All in all there is absolutely no way of knowing for sure what is going to happen but just keep in mind, look at the bigger picture and we could still be in a bigger bear macro trend, and this could be that reaction rally that fizzes out. </p>\n\n<p>Just keep level headed and realistic about price expectations and predictions, and keep DCA’ing, the rest is just noise, don’t buy into the hype of everything going 20x within a couple months and bitcoin has to be 200k by this years end. This is a patient mans game.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: It has came to my attention that people are taking this way too personally. This isn’t a “bearish” post or trying to tell everyone to be bearish it’s too be careful at times like this where everyone thinks we’re on the bull trend again, which is exactly what happens with every reaction rally. Be wary of both directions, too many people are thinking it’s got months left of pumps so chasing the pump ASAP. Be patient or you might get creamed if the market happens to swing the other way.</p>\n\n<p>People on this sub get way too sensitive anytime someone posts something half realistic.</p>\n\n<p>Also people saying i think I’m some crypto expert and that I can predict the market. Nice of you to say that and try get upvotes against me but I just never made that claim. Didn’t know suggesting people to take into account a possible bear trend is “claiming to be an expert” but I guess we learn something new everyday.\nAm I telling you what to do with your money? No I’m not.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
