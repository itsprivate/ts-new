I believe this is nothing but great news. Some of you right about now are probably thinking I am crazy because “regulation” is never a good thing. But in this case it is, or should I say, could be. Shining the light on crypto and providing a base set of regulations could open the door to a whole new world of investors such as major institutions and every day investors such as you and me. Crypto will never be widely accepted by the majority until there are some forms of regulation. Now saying that, I am not for overstepping the boundaries and the government going all out to try to kill crypto in general. But I am for a small set of regulations to ease the mind of those on the fence for investing or making it any option for their investors. How does everyone else feel? This is just a general discussion to go over the possible pros and cons of the executive order.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
