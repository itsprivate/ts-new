Shocked pikachu face wondering if pornhub had just blueballed me.  </p>\n\n<p>The first thing I did was go to the pornhub&#39;s contact us page, emailing wasn&#39;t available so I had to use live chat. At this point I didn&#39;t think it was a big issue, so I didn&#39;t take much screenshot of the actual messages, but the conclusion was that upon learning that I had used cryptocurrency as payment I stop getting support from live chat and was told to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:cryptopayment@probiller.com\">cryptopayment@probiller.com</a> as there is nothing he or she can do.  </p>\n\n<p>Here comes the annoying part. You still awake? Aight.  </p>\n\n<p>This is my first email to <a href=\"mailto:cryptopayment@probiller.com\">cryptopayment@probiller.com</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y2ob8i7hyuh61.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df8dad6b960cb0d4fb382b6e74c68382a6fd9903\">First email to cryptopayment@probiller.com</a></p>\n\n<p>About 17 hours later, I received this reply from them saying the payment was pending, shocked pikachu face again, I was confused because the payment was successfully completed and I even had access to premium for a short while. (Althought in hindsight, I probably should have tame the beast back then)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p7hu2alwyuh61.png?width=1583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7da71d9f49e5dff20f74ffd9ad3391becd2678e\">Probiller told me that the payment was pending</a></p>\n\n<p>So Logically, I decided to dig thru thr my transaction and provide proof that the transaction has indeed completed successfully</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qbsydcjrzuh61.png?width=983&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73777f2c2b71ec3b247d6eaa94dc1621c68eb70b\">I used TRX instead amongst other coin because at the time it had the lowest combined fee</a></p>\n\n<p>10 Hours later, probiller finally replied but with the exact same message as before</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ve7q2y3f0vh61.png?width=1693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0981d2688c60708eda514a74140147f859b3c457\">So much for my effort to dig out the transaction</a></p>\n\n<p>So I was starting to think maybe my transaction did fail, so I tried to look for the initial email like he/she suggested, but I couldn&#39;t find any such email, the only email I got is the one screenshot on top. AFAIK the transaction was completed successfully so I followed the link and submitted a support ticket to Coinpayment. (At this point I wasn&#39;t aware that I was being redirected to a third party)  </p>\n\n<p>So I submitted a support ticket using the link provided explaining my situation all while still assuming Coinpayment and ProBiller are one and the same (didn&#39;t screenshot my actual message because it was a contact form), to which Coinpayment promptly replied me saying the transaction was completed from their end and I will have to contact the merchant.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nolyms212vh61.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c4106ae161a0db72f451ca2eccdc8786518bb5c\">Coinpayment says my transaction was completed successfully</a></p>\n\n<p>Shocked pikachu face a third time because he just redirected me back to the other person like a ping pong game, but I told him that I was directed here and ask him to please help me</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/969lcc9f3vh61.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46693574beff626d4d6ea64f92a4aa8bac828dcd\">https://preview.redd.it/969lcc9f3vh61.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46693574beff626d4d6ea64f92a4aa8bac828dcd</a></p>\n\n<p>It is at this point where I realized I am now talking to a third party.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally I had to go back to probiller since it&#39;s not up to coinpayment, but knowing that probiller takes forever to reply my email I thought I give pornhub&#39;s livechat a second try, but the person on the other side of the live chat told me my charges failed and then disconnected immediately.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cc7s1yfo4vh61.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f8726807ad9112a49ce74d6f02187a4633ab5ad\">https://preview.redd.it/cc7s1yfo4vh61.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f8726807ad9112a49ce74d6f02187a4633ab5ad</a></p>\n\n<p>I also sent an email thru probiller&#39;s support page explaining my situation but was basically redirected to cryptopayment@probiller</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/spdrwwjn5vh61.png?width=971&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42d3674650b7c57a49b50780dfcb6117aa316c7\">Reply from Probiller&#39;s support page</a></p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t going to just give up dogecoin gainz like this, so I reached out to probiller&#39;s crypto payment email telling them that coinpayment has confirmed my payment was successfully complete, but each time it resulted in the exact same reply, I did this a few times over 3 days, here&#39;s 2 of the many similar emails I sent and the same copy paste message Probiller alwats replied with.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oqwv8fsm6vh61.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb2d9546f4cc5e4f49ff42039085f2f7d38d69ab\">https://preview.redd.it/oqwv8fsm6vh61.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb2d9546f4cc5e4f49ff42039085f2f7d38d69ab</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/70g0znx76vh61.png?width=1683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe8d2a5329229bb1bae3f2952930348b64f98925\">https://preview.redd.it/70g0znx76vh61.png?width=1683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe8d2a5329229bb1bae3f2952930348b64f98925</a></p>\n\n<p>I was getting tired but I decided to follow up with coinpayment and hoping they&#39;ll help talk to their merchant like a responsible business, but nah it was up to me to talk to Probiller</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b5psvhgy7vh61.png?width=1114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a544c1ab385cfa3c7a49b6d7a1cf5753205eddb4\">https://preview.redd.it/b5psvhgy7vh61.png?width=1114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a544c1ab385cfa3c7a49b6d7a1cf5753205eddb4</a></p>\n\n<p>And I did just that, this time I included a message from coinpayment clearly saying my transaction was completed only to be replied with the same message again.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u36243nb7vh61.png?width=1637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df502c8148399e8af91f5dc4632ab3aabd29c8cc\">https://preview.redd.it/u36243nb7vh61.png?width=1637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df502c8148399e8af91f5dc4632ab3aabd29c8cc</a></p>\n\n<p>After sending a few similar emails and repeatly getting the same message replied, I was getting really pissed so I decided to send out an email to Probiller and ask for them to get a technician to check on it, because obviously their system is bugged and this time they replied using the same message AND a typed sentence (Finally we made some progress)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uqvgbyh4avh61.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b1a9e02e0c80e8db3a4a1496c506f1a27803d6\">https://preview.redd.it/uqvgbyh4avh61.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b1a9e02e0c80e8db3a4a1496c506f1a27803d6</a></p>\n\n<p>So with this little progress I went back to Coinpayment again and this time also CCed probiller, I told the the guy over there to please communicate with probiller as they are business partners and I am but a customer trying to pay for porn.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z6n47y03bvh61.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17a149878e93f648c4664a58dcfe4c767f9821c3\">https://preview.redd.it/z6n47y03bvh61.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17a149878e93f648c4664a58dcfe4c767f9821c3</a></p>\n\n<p>Coinpayment basically said no. (wtf?)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0dtjpw6ebvh61.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb62defc846daa5cd356eb6d120ddc283db123e3\">https://preview.redd.it/0dtjpw6ebvh61.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb62defc846daa5cd356eb6d120ddc283db123e3</a></p>\n\n<p>At this point I have basically given up and accepted the fact that neither Pornhub, Probiller nor Coinpayments are willing to help me, and my Doge gains are gone for good, but I decided to just send one last email to probiller, my last ditch of effort.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zx8r7ewlcvh61.png?width=1352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dab6386caed8411ee3abe68729525b2693e8f848\">The last ditch of effort</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>And then it happened! 5 hours later I suddenly receive an email from probiller telling me the problem has been corrected and I receive another welocme to pornhub premium email, and now I can finally fap to my heart contend.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0n4bno30dvh61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c785b92d32eac72a7aec841be75771475936c57\">Notice how they finally addressed me as a customer now</a></p>\n\n<p>I am seriously impressed with my stamina in attempting to recover my premium porn access.</p>\n\n<p>Well that&#39;s that,  thank you if you have read thru all that, maybe consider upvoting this post so I can earn some moon to extend the premium membership for a sequel of pain?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
