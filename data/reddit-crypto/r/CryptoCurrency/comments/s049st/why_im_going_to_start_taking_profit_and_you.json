I believe in the tech long term. I believe that the coins I&amp;#39;m invested in, will in 5-10 years time form the foundations of decentralised AI, finance and web3.0 infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m likely to see a bear market or dip soon&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; but who cares?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The short-term dips won&amp;#39;t matter in 5 years time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;These kinds of gains take years in the stock market, and I&amp;#39;ve seen them in less than a year&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt; I was naive, waking up to my portfolio at higher highs every morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;-8%&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#39;s my portfolio today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All those unrealised gains, lost. Everything that was once beautiful flourishing green, is red like the blood of a slaughtered goat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I considered selling some of my gains at the top, but I was too greedy. I wanted more. Had I taken some profits, I would&amp;#39;ve had the opportunity to buy in at much lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What am I going to do?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m still HODLing.&lt;/strong&gt; But I&amp;#39;ve decided during the next bull run, I will take profit &lt;strong&gt;(nothing massive, the initial investment or less)&lt;/strong&gt; and hold those funds in wait for a significant dip. The dips do come and will come and I think it really benefits your mental health to be able to take some amount of profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
