There are &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of posts on Reddit talking about people losing their life savings, feeling &amp;quot;weirdly detached&amp;quot; from seeing their money vanish in thin air, and everyone panicking...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... and even then, you see other people commenting stuff like &amp;quot;I feel better about reading these posts, I would never trade leverage, my funds are safe&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not the time to boast about your good decisions in other people&amp;#39;s misery posts.&lt;/strong&gt; People are attempting suicide. With people in this state, all it takes is a single comment reinforcing their &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; decisions for someone to take their lives away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please, please be gentle with your words during this time. Offer help, offer your presence if they need to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can talk about strategies and good/bad decisions after the fire is put off. For now, let&amp;#39;s just be human beings and support whoever is feeling lost in this shitstorm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
