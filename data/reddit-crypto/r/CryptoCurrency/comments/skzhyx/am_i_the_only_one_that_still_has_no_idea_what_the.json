Rather then chatting with someone on zoom I&amp;#39;ll spend half an hour wiring up my VR kit so I can chat to their avatar in a pretend conference room?

But which world? Presumably anyone can make their own metaverse? Does Eve Online count as the metaverse? Habbo Hotel? Or does it have to have VR?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t the internet just the metaverse? Or does it always require some sort of game like VR interface to count?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what role does Blockchain play in the metaverse? Is it intended to support the persistence and the idea of one true metaverse? But whose Blockchain? Surely anyone can create their own Blockchain for their own metaverse? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are people buying virtual land in the metaverse? What utility does it have? And given it&amp;#39;s just a simulation, the land itself is presumably infinite? So why pay for it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I just an old grumpy man?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
