Bonus points if they have a powerful earn program, cards, or seamless DeFi integration. I don&amp;#39;t need a one stop shop, but I do want to avoid extensive gas fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys use, and what do you prefer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Plutus looking very nice, but they only do EU, so that is very sad for a US person like me. I&amp;#39;ll be eagerly awaiting US support someday...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
