Even if the upcoming months seem very bearish, you have to stick to your DCA plan. That’s the whole purpose of dollar cost averaging. I saw a lot of people saying that it was the perfect time to DCA when BTC price was at 40K$, but now that BTC is at 20k$ the say that they will wait for the market to go lower. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s perfectly fine if you want to predict the market, or if you will wait for BTC or ETH to go lower to buy more. But be conscious that doing this defeats the whole point of DCA. Just do what you want, but don’t lie to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
