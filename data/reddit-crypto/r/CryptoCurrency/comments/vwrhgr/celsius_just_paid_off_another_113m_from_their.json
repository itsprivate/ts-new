Gox.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the last weeks they successfully completly eliminated their liquidation risk (now at $2.7k) and paid down hundred of millions in debt. Even in the least 24h they paid down 113M on debt to AAVE any Compound, now their only remaining debt is 123M. And they can very likely pay that off too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy to see that at least somewhere investors and not getting rigged. Hopefully they can actually lift their suspension that have been here for nearly month now and get back to normal. Obviously the trust is and should be gone but at least investors will keep their money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
