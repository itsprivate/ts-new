Crypto to take off and the worlds billionaires and millionaires to not get with the program?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should be happy that as more big institutional money enters the crypto world, the total crypto marketcap increases, raises all boats and you, having already been invested, are making profits.

Please. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are their exit liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
