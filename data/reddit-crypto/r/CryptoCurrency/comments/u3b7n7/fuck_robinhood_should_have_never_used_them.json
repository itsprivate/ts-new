I literally used them for 2 months, realized I did not like the platform, then the GME and AMC bullshit and the shady practices with the hedge fund, then the wallet bullshit where you couldn&amp;#39;t sell your crypto. After all that it just made me hate them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily before I got this heads up I had already began converting my accounts into a different email and I regularly update my passwords. This was by chance that i did the new email. Very happy I did&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if I didn&amp;#39;t have enough reasons to not like RH this is the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck robinhood. Update your passwords, get a new email and stay away from this shit show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aoga66kazft81.jpg?width=1908&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=30e8b8bcf3f566eccc43dedd738368f8d7d59784\"&gt;Here is the proof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
