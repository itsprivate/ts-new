  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! Today marks the anniversary of my first ever crypto transaction! My first purchase was of Ethereum, and since then it has been nothing else but a learning journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of things I learnt later than what I wished, so here are a few of the things I wish I did earlier when investing in crypto:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping track of transactions&lt;/strong&gt;: when I first bought crypto, I invested X amount of fiat without keeping track of how much I have put into it. Later, I discovered the portfolio trackers. Some good examples are the &lt;a href=\"https://delta.app/en\"&gt;Delta App&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/\"&gt;CoinMarketCap&lt;/a&gt; portfolio tool. I rather input the transaction manually after making them, as I don&amp;#39;t really like giving API keys to 3rd parties.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening a Vault for Moons&lt;/strong&gt;: easily the worst mistake I have ever done. I never knew the existence of moons until they, well, mooned. I always use my PC or laptop for Reddit and never seen the Vault menu, and when I found out about I felt so stupid as I was quite active in this sub when I first started. Open your Vault!! It is literally free crypto for your posts - please focus on quality!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having Native Wallets&lt;/strong&gt;: this isn&amp;#39;t a mistake, but more of a &amp;quot;help the ecosystem&amp;quot; kind of thing. What I must recommend though is to keep all your assets away from exchanges. A system failure, hacking attack or just bankruptcy can be the end of your funds, so keep your coins in an external wallet. I started with &lt;a href=\"https://www.exodus.com/\"&gt;Exodus Wallet&lt;/a&gt;, as it has the most assets and allows staking for interest rewards. With time, I migrated to native wallets (wallets made for a single network in particular) and around 80% of my assets are secured with a Ledger Nano X (hardware wallet, not hackable!).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t stick to one exchange&lt;/strong&gt;: not all exchanges have all the coins you will want. Not all exchanges have the same features and most importantly, not all have the same fees. what exchanges do I recommend? I personally use &lt;a href=\"https://Crypto.com\"&gt;Crypto.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, each one to their own and geographical restrictions may apply to some exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do stupid things that can cause you headaches&lt;/strong&gt;: what I mean with this is, do not add 5 bank accounts to your fiat withdrawal addresses, don&amp;#39;t deposit fiat from 4 different banks in 3 different countries, 2 credit cards and 4 debit cards. Focus on 1 and 1. One card. One bank account. Work yourself around that and it will help you massively. I have seen so many issues with people with locked accounts due to having to verify details etc. that can just be solved by this. I never had a single issue using &lt;a href=\"https://www.revolut.com/\"&gt;Revolut&lt;/a&gt; as my bank account and the virtual card as my means of payment if i use this. Also, all bank deposits are allowed to exchanges from them (EU Customer). KYC! Just do it. The government knows all about you anyways, so don&amp;#39;t worry. You are happy to give your bank details, name, surname, card number away but not a selfie of yourself? The big exchanges have great privacy and security measures, don&amp;#39;t worry!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Rewards. There are A LOT OF THEM!&lt;/strong&gt;: Crypto is a baby. A volatile baby, but a baby nonetheless. Everything is new! DeFi projects can offer 100%+ APY by staking your coins, projects with PoS networks offer some really good interest by just hodling their coin and a lot of platforms offer interest in stablecoins and other tokens. Personally, I use one of the VISA Cards that CDC offer. It earns me cashback, free services and lets be honest, looks cool af!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lastly but most importantly, ENJOY&lt;/strong&gt;: Don&amp;#39;t look at the chart every day and worry. Yes I look at my portfolio every day but just to see if it is a good moment to buy or not. I never worry. If you are a day trader, then yes. A hodler, then hodl. You are here for the long run. Enjoy the experience, the learning and the communities (apart from &lt;a href=\"/r/bitcoin\"&gt;r/bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; - that&amp;#39;s a cult). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps newbies a bit more, and makes it easier to start up! Have a great year everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
