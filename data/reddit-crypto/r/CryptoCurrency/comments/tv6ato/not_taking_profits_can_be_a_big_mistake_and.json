  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see, there are two types of people here:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. People who say that HODLING is the key to success&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Others who say you are wrong if you do not take a profit from time to time, DCA in and DCA out&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The thing is, both are relatively right&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20150906/\"&gt;top 15 coins&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 and if you invested in them and held all of them, with most of them you would be in profit. Some profits would be small, some profit like BTC would be very significant.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s the top 15 coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even in top15 you will find dead coins like &amp;quot;Banx&amp;quot; that went from &lt;em&gt;$1.57 to $0.0003death&lt;/em&gt;. So in case you were there in 2015 and held all this time you would be rich, but most of us didn&amp;#39;t invest back then and most of us would probably sell a lot of it by now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So with this mentality, they would say the key is in HODLING.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simply choose quality projects, invest money in them and wait a few years for wealth.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So lets take a look at&lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20171217/\"&gt;2017.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you invested  in top15 coins in 2017 and compare some of those coins to today’s price you would be at loss. And those are good projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coins like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCH that was $1,862.88 and now is $375.23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LTC that was $318.72 and now is $126.40&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IOTA that was $3.93 and now is $0.8997&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DASH that was $1,105.92 and now is $130.23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Huge loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with this example we can see that not taking profits is a &lt;strong&gt;mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In essence, it could be said that it all depends on the time you invested, but just HODLING without taking profits can be fatal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, with blue chips like BTC and ETH there are no mistakes and people who were patient now don&amp;#39;t have to worry about money for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This being said, I am holding some coins for a long term. I am not against holding, I am just saying that holding mentality is not everything and that taking profits is a right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
