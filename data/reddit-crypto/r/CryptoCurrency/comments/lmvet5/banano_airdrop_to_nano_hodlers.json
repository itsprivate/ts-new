There will be a snapshot of the Nano network <em>at an undisclosed time</em> <strong><em>between February 22nd-28th</em></strong> <em>(the real time is still a surprise).</em> Anyone holding Nano in their nano_wallet will be sent Banano to their identical ban_wallet. There is a detailed walkthrough on how to claim below.</p>\n\n<h1>Who is Eligible?

As explained in the <a href=\"https://www.daily-peel.com/post/nanoairdrop\"><strong>Nano Airdrop Round 1</strong></a>, The way Banano and Nano reaches consensus is through a process known as <em>Open Representative Voting</em>. This is different than the Proof of Work and Proof of Stake methods of most blockchains and cryptocurrencies. This is what allows Banano/Nano to be instant and feeless, and is also why there is no mining or staking required. Instead, people run nodes for the network, and others delegate their voting weight to those node runners (also known as representatives). Basically summarized, everyone picks someone running a node (a rep) to speak to the blockchain on their behalf. You can select/change that representative at any time for free. When you create a wallet you are assigned a default rep associated with that wallet. If you have not changed it yourself, you will still be on that default rep. Banano wants to help encourage people to delegate their voting weight to less mainstream reps in an effort to further decentralize the network.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Incentive:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There will be a bonus to the airdrop for all accounts who have elected a principle representative with &lt;1% voting weight. For perspective on why this is important, currently; 68.8% of all Nano are delegated to Representatives with &gt;1% voting weight, and 34% of all Nano are held on exchanges.</p>\n\n<p>This is a good tool for assessing Nano Representatives: <a href=\"https://mynano.ninja/\">MyNano.Ninja</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to change your Representative:</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the purpose of this section we will go through how to change our Representative using screenshots from Natrium mobile wallet.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6hdskj1aiai61.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871f97ed560e87eab981c11d7fa02c609f2d7b0c\">Natrium&#39;s Change Representative Button</a></p>\n\n<p>First from the side panel select the &quot;Change Representative&quot; option. Once there, you will see a nano_address similar to the one below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/txmnl2tbiai61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ac7904afc0a50d2f4091fb05b4d37c193d0d35\">Example Representative Change and Pick From a List Menu</a></p>\n\n<p>This Representative shown on the left is the one used for the <a href=\"https://www.daily-peel.com/post/nanoairdrop\"><strong>first Banano-to-Nano Airdrop on February 13th</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a list of Nodes and their stats on <a href=\"https://nanocrawler.cc/network\"><strong>Nanocrawler.cc</strong></a> under the network tab. The Natrium &quot;Pick From a List&quot; option is also a good method to choose a rep with the voting weight requirements for the airdrop bonus.</p>\n\n<p><em>Reminder: to receive the bonus your rep must have less than 1% of the total voting weight.</em></p>\n\n<h1>When the Airdrop does go out, this is how you can claim:</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Importing the Seed:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Export the Private Key or Mnemonic Phrase from your Nano Wallet</li>\n<li>Import the Private Key or Mnemonic Phrase into your Banano Wallet (<a href=\"https://kalium.banano.cc/\"><strong>Kalium</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://vault.banano.cc/\"><strong>Vault</strong></a>)</li>\n<li>The Ban_address version of your Nano_wallet will be holding the Banano. Withdraw them (or leave them in their since you do indeed hold the keys)</li>\n<li><em>note that seeds/mnemonics can be used on both blockchains and the address stays the same. The only thing that changes is the nano_ or ban_ prefix of the public address.</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Sweeping the Wallet Balance:</strong> (<a href=\"https://kalium.banano.cc/\"><strong>Kalium</strong></a>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o85jg9ddiai61.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8926893977046cd9af68ef234681b6f508c70817\">Kalium&#39;s Load from Paper Wallet (Sweep) Button</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Export the Private Key or Mnemonic Phrase from your Nano Wallet</li>\n<li>Locate Kalium&#39;s &quot;Load from Paper Wallet&quot; option in the side panel</li>\n<li>Select &quot;Manual Entry&quot;</li>\n<li>Paste the Private Key or Mnemonic Phrase to your Nano Wallet</li>\n<li>You will be prompted to withdraw the Balance of the inputted Seed to the Banano wallet you are currently signed in to within the app.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We hope that with educational rewards such as this more users will be encouraged to remove their funds from the exchanges, and truly take control of their coins in the way they were designed to be used. Decentralized Digital Currency is closer every day. <em>Don&#39;t let your memes be dreams</em>.</p>\n\n<p>See Also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://daily-peel.com/post/nanoairdrop2\">The Daily Peel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/lmhl3v/airdrop_to_nano_holders_round_2/\">r/Nano Thread</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/lmhj19/banano_airdrop_to_nano_holders_round_2/\">r/Banano Thread</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/lkuv3p/every_wallet_delegating_a_certain_rep_even_if/\">Airdrop to Nano Holders Round 1 Thread</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
