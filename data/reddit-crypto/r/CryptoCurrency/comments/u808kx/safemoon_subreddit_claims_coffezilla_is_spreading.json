There are millions of dollars missing that should be in the liquidity pool and are now in the pockets of safemoons creators. All of it can be looked up by everyone on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet the safemoon subreddit calls Coffezilla &amp;#39;FUDzilla&amp;#39; and claims he is spreading FUD. Right now they are celebrating for buying the dip... while being 95% down from ATH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not everything is FUD. This echo-chamber, cult-like behaviour is sadly quite common in the crypto space, not just with meme coins like SafeMoon. Take care and think for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
