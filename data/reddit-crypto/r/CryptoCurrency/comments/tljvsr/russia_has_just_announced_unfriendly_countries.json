So i asked them to DYOR. They reported back that they found the perfect solution. Shiba Inu. Whilst they say Shiba is the true shitcoin of the crypto world, apparently it is the second most volatile currency other than the Rouble. So it&amp;#39;s basically an upgrade to the Rouble. As they say, a better shitcoin is better than a shitcoin&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the announcement, Shiba Inu has shot up 3000 percent finally proving 14 year old kids right that Shib has mooned to a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world is now coming to terms with the fact red bull chugging 14 year olds now control 95 percent of the world&amp;#39;s wealth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
