The main disadvantages I know after being here for a while and investing myself:</p>\n\n<h2>1. No smart contracts</h2>\n\n<p>Some may argue that this is an advantage, while others consider smart contracts the future of crypto; that&#39;s up to you. It does make sense that NANO isn&#39;t supporting them for technological reasons, and that&#39;s ok. Nano doesn&#39;t have to be the only coin in the planet and can coexist with coins that are specifically made to support smart contracts and thus better at it.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Lacking privacy</h2>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just as private as BTC, which is already pretty successful. Besides, not sure if it would cause regulation issues, as others have pointed out in different posts. I&#39;d love for privacy in a coin to be an advantage but it doesn&#39;t seem like it in our society.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this can be solved to some extent in the second layer.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Deflationary currency</h2>\n\n<p>There haven&#39;t been any successful deflationary currencies yet AFAIK. The only time that happened was with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_(Japan%5C\">Japan&#39;s Lost Decade</a>), which wasn&#39;t going to end well according to expert economists. I don&#39;t know enough about the topic to discuss more about it and I still have some reading to do, but my current research isn&#39;t too optimistic. Not because it&#39;s impossible, but due to the fact that it has never happened before, which makes actual Nano adoption harder and another challenge to overcome.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest everyone to learn more about this themselves. It&#39;s a very interesting topic. There&#39;s <a href=\"https://cdn.mises.org/Deflation%20and%20Liberty_2.pdf\">this small book I haven&#39;t read yet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErUQnd-YFGg\">this great video</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdYUQxD01_0&amp;amp;t=2s\">another video</a>, but look for more yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Is it really a good enough fiat replacement?</h2>\n\n<p>NANO is great, <strong>but is it great enough to replace fiat for your average Joe?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Consider that the average fiat user doesn&#39;t care about decentralization at all. If anything, it&#39;s worse for them: it&#39;s harder to set up, understand, and they have to keep private keys safe.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My father is unable to understand how cryptocurrencies work. Thus, he doesn&#39;t plan on using them as he doesn&#39;t trust crypto at all.\n* NANO is green, but not that much in comparison to fiat -- at least when we&#39;re talking about digital fiat transactions. Would like to see facts and an objective comparison on both physical and digital fiat, though.\n* NANO is instant... just like fiat, or at least for day-to-day amounts and between close communities. Nano is a global currency; it shines with larger amounts and between banks from unrelated countries. For example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area\">SEPA</a> transfers are limited to Europe and are slow AF, and other methods have fees and are also quite slow. But that&#39;s not really something the average Joe cares about, he just wants to pay for the beer he just had.\n* NANO is feeless: that <em>is</em> something nice. But converting <em>to</em> NANO does have fees, which is required to use it (although less important). I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever get rid of all middlemen, and we&#39;ll always have to deal with fees, although probably much smaller. Not that big of a deal, but something to take into account.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s an example regarding adoption I&#39;ve experienced myself and consider in the same situation as crypto:</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a huge Linux fan and user, and it is objectively better than Windows in many ways: it respects your privacy, is open and transparent, and completely free. It&#39;s usually a bit more performant, and you have full control over it. Yet, not more than 5% of desktop users run this OS, and most are tech-savvy people.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love it if this happened, but the advantages just won&#39;t convince average Windows users to switch, because it&#39;s a somewhat complicated process for the tech illiterate or they just don&#39;t care enough.</p>\n\n<p>Some are also confused about why there are so many distros and which one is best (same as crypto), specially considering that the user of a distro (coin/token) will tell you their own is the best one. Sometimes we are our own enemies. Not to mention that Windows (fiat) is the most used platform, which means there&#39;s less support for Linux (nano) sometimes. That makes it a big reason why people don&#39;t want to switch their OS (currency).</p>\n\n<p>The issues in this section don&#39;t mean that the switch to crypto is impossible. Only that it&#39;s going to take muuuuuch more time than most of their users think, and that it could take many generations IMO. Considering cryptocurrencies are <em>just</em> starting to get attention now, it&#39;s to be expected -- you can&#39;t change the world in two days. This also affects all kinds of cryptocurrencies, not just Nano, so at least it&#39;s something we all fight together against.</p>\n\n<h2>5. No node incentive</h2>\n\n<p>It can only make sense that without fees nor inflation there&#39;s not much incentive to run a node. There&#39;s just no way around it. I can get behind the common counter-argument that companies that use NANO run nodes to secure their own holdings, which so far has been working well, but it&#39;s something to be aware of and that we don&#39;t have much experience with.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Spam attack</h2>\n\n<p>Spam is also a concern: if Nano is instant and feeless, what prevents a Nano hater from spamming the network?</p>\n\n<p>As this post is being written we&#39;re under a small spam attack. <a href=\"https://nanolooker.com/\">We&#39;re at ~30 Transations Per Second</a>, while we&#39;re usually at ~2, so about a x15 increase. Is Nano any slower? Not really. With Nano&#39;s model of having a blockchain per account, ledger bloat is also reduced; only full nodes need the entire history and storage is quite cheap (and pruning hasn&#39;t even been implemented yet). While this is a relatively small attack and we should work on preventing them, there are many ways to approach this and it might get better as Nano gets more usage.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Devs could do better</h2>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t take me wrong. I value the time and effort put into the Nano foundation and all its members for creating this coin, but for instance I think it could be more transparent. I&#39;d love to have a more in-depth analysis of the foundation&#39;s expendings and regarding decisions taken about Nano&#39;s future (most technological decisions are nicely explained in their <a href=\"https://medium.com/nanocurrency\">medium account</a>). The <a href=\"https://medium.com/nanocurrency/q-a-with-colin-lemahieu-recap-48dd61cc320b\">whole Appia thing</a> has already been talked about many times and I don&#39;t want to beat a dead horse. I support it, but I consider it could have been a much more transparent process. I would also like to see a clearer roadmap than a GitHub project.</p>\n\n<p>But considering that cryptocurrencies seek decentralization, and that Nano is proven to be mostly a community project, I&#39;d like the dev team having as little power as possible (to some extent). I don&#39;t think it&#39;s important that e.g. the devs promote Nano. See for example the <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/lufruq/25_million_impressions_five_thousand_clicks_and/\">guy who just started an ad campaign on PornHub</a>. It&#39;s just a different way of doing things, and I prefer it.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Bitgrail</h2>\n\n<p>Most posts like this one include <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/analysis/bitgrail-nano-saga-twisted-tale-hacks-threats-lawsuit/\">the Bitgrail scam</a> as a temporary disadvantage, as some lost a lot of money. It was just a bad experience overall, and some people only know Nano because of this. I don&#39;t consider this a huge disadvantage, but I wanted to include at least a mention.</p>\n\n<h2>9. Epoch blocks are centralized</h2>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s one I didn&#39;t know about: the epoch blocks are a centralized solution. The upgrade itself was decentralized because all nodes agreed to do so, but it&#39;s only up to the team to add epoch blocks from that moment on. Read more about it <a href=\"https://medium.com/nanocurrency/an-epoch-blocks-explainer-aa22905b28db\">here</a> and see more discussion here: <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/9pabov/an_epoch_block_explainer/\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/hwijl2/nano_epoch_v2_blocks_explained/\">[2]</a>.</p>\n\n<p>DYOR</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
