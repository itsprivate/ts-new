It is the only reason prices even stay close to each other from one exchange to the other to begin with: a multitude of bots are developed to profit from such price differences, and thus help the market in having somewhat unified prices.</p>\n\n<h1>How could I profit from it in this case?</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>(Mandatory) Already have ETC on Coinbase.</li>\n<li>(Mandatory) Have access to another exchange that trades ETC at the &quot;normal&quot; price.</li>\n<li>Sell ETC on Coinbase around 9.5 USD (at the time of writing) and Buy it back on another exchange around 7.7 USD(T).</li>\n<li>Profit! You effectively sold your ETC for 9.5 USD and bought it back for 7.7. You now have the same amount of ETC, and ~1.8 USD per ETC bonus because of this operation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Why does it happen in this case? Why is it still not resolved?</h1>\n\n<p>Since ETC was 51% attacked several times throughout the past years, Coinbase has decided that to deposit ETC on their platform, you would need <a href=\"https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/why-is-my-transaction-pending\">91,000 blockchain confirmations</a>. This is approximately 2 weeks. In other words, you need to wait 2 weeks for you ETC deposit to arrive on Coinbase.</p>\n\n<p>Under normal circumstances, the price inefficiency would be solved immediately because deposits and withdrawals would happen in a matter of minutes/hours, and the new price would land somewhere in between the 2. But in this case since no one can bring ETC to Coinbase, this imperfection could last up to 2 weeks, at which point the inflows of ETC will start coming in to profit from this arbitrage opportunity.</p>\n\n<h1>Who are you and why do you care?</h1>\n\n<p>Merely a bot developer, my daily job is to code Crypto trading bots and to earn money for myself and clients for a fee. In the process and using what I learned so far, I try to help other less fortunate people that are missing some key trading concepts, or are simply new to the ecosystem.<br/>\nAny question you ever had about Trading that is still puzzling you? Feel free to drop it below and I&#39;ll see if I can have a shot at it! If not, I am sure other people in the subreddit would be delighted to do the same.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
