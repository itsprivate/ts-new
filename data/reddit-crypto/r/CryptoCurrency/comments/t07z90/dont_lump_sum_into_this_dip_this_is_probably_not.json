  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I see a recommendation on this subreddit to &amp;#39;buy the dip&amp;#39;, I remind people that we don&amp;#39;t know if this is the bottom, and that you should be patient - don&amp;#39;t invest all your money at once, do it gradually. I&amp;#39;ve gained quite a few downvotes for commenting this, but I think it is solid advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, another dip has presented itself to us. The same advice holds true, we don&amp;#39;t know if the invasion will get worse, and so don&amp;#39;t invest all your money at once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the previous dips:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In November, BTC dipped from $65k to $57k, a 12% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;#39;d be down 39% today.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In December, BTC dipped from $57k to $49k, a 14% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;#39;d be down 29% today.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In January, BTC dipped from $47k to $41k, a 13% dip. If you had lump summed in then, &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;#39;d be down 15% today.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I am not saying that you shouldn&amp;#39;t buy the dip, but do it gradually. Every dip seems like the bottom, but it most likely isn&amp;#39;t, especially with this geopolitical turmoil. Do not spend all your money on this dip, keep a good chunk of money to invest if the market falls further. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lump summing now could be catching a falling knife - don&amp;#39;t get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
