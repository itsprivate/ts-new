  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted about this plan last week and went through with it yesterday. I’m sure I could of timed it better. But my plan is to stake what’s available of these and cold storage the rest. The plan would be to revisit all these purchases between 2024-2026. If they’re still alive either hodl longer or take profits if they’ve made good gains. Some are good alts that I picked and some were just random purchases off Coinbase that I could get a lot of tokens/coins for a few dollars just for fun. I’ll break down my current portfolio below with the gamble portfolio as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How the $1000 was spent:\nAvax 11%\nAlgo 9%\nPolygon 9%\nEnjin 9%\nCardano 9%\nGala 8%\nCosmos 7%\nChiliz 6%\nDot 5%\nTezos 5%\nDoge 4%\nAnchor 4%\nBat 2%\nFet 2%\nUni 1%\nLrc 1%\nSpell 1%\nJasmy 1%\n1inch 1%\nPerp 1%\nWluna 1%\nLoom 1%\nVoyager 1%\nShping 1%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real portfolio:\nBTC 52% ETH 32% Link 9% Sol 4% HNT 2% Amp 1% also have some random coinbase earn coins and like 120 CRO that was given. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said my plan is to hodl and stake all these for the longterm hoping one of these random alts will pull the next Sol. Wanting that $1k spent to at least make itself back in the future (I know they could all go to $0). Let me know your thoughts on this strategy. I may add some more alts over time but in very small increments like $10-100 per purchase. Reason I picked most of these is cause of ease of purchase off CB I know of better alts on other exchanges didn’t want to go through hassle to buy them though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever bought a random alt and forgot about it for years to come back and find it mooned?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
