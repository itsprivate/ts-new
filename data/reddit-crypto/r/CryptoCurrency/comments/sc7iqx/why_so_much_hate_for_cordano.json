People forgive ETH for practically everything but cardano is bad because of a congestion? Or because it didn&amp;#39;t grow much in market value? \nOr is it another reason which I missed? Like annoying fan base?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really think ADA doesn&amp;#39;t deserve so much hate. It is a solid project with a really nice team and it might have a bright future ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vve&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
