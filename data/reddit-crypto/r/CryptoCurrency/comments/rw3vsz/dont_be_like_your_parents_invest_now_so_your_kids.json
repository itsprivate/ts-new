I know there&amp;#39;s a chance the market will collapse in a spectacle of people pulling their hair out and jumping out windows, but with the amount of institutions and big companies getting involved, i doubt it. the amount of users they will bring on to what ever networks they decide to work with will def help the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;every time the internet upgrades a good handful of people get rich, and yes alot of people lose money also ( but those are the impatient people or the people who put in too much and end up having to pull out )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;even look at this video from after skool is all about crypto. ( mainly ether and bitcoin ) but they are a youtube channel that makes videos about mental health and life&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VIDEO: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGHMyxYSa58\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGHMyxYSa58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if they are making videos about it, i know this is def not going anywhere and who ever chooses the best chains to invest in will change their life for the better or worse if you only want hookers and cocaine... your choice and youre money&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So for the love of MONEY,&lt;/strong&gt; just DYOR and Invest&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HODEL&amp;gt; PROFIT&amp;gt; CREATE&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
