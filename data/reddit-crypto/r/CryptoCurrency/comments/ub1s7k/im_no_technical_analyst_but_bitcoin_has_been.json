Every time it goes back down to this average we get the FUD &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Bitcoin has crashed, fell, &amp;amp; tanked&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; articles. This may be oversimplified, but prices seem to both shake and grasps these average lines. Recent FUD has been calling for 800/900 day SMA levels. For some hopium; notice how those longer averages just slowly and constantly trend upwards.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice. This is just a chart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
