So you gotta keep an open mind throughout the week and be ready for everything. Here the list of most important events:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings, a lot of Earnings. As it&amp;#39;s earnings season right now at the stock market and we already had a dull with snapchat falling -35% and losing billions. Now it&amp;#39;s actually getting real with much of big tech like Apple and Microsoft reporting. Bad will cause stock markets to melt and with a high correlation also crypto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOMC. This is probably the biggest event of the week where we will actually get our rate hike, whether it&amp;#39;s 75bps or 100bps is to be seen. A 100bps would definitely cause havoc over the markets as already a 75vps last month did make markets melt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GDP Q2 numbers, this could be the most important event too of its done in the week, which is it exactly clear yet (may be early August) but if the Q2 number like the Q1 number would be in the minus then the US would officially be in a recession and even if most economists knew that, the constant lying from politics could have made it unclear for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recently added event is the US dividing whether they should declare an health emergency over monkeypox. Just now the WHO declared one and Biden administration said to do it on Monday. I&amp;#39;m not expecting it to be big news but certainly some minor panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
