Walmart, Amazon, and other large corporations fund social welfare programs that their workers use in order to deprive them of a living wage and healthcare. Cryptocurrency allows us to break free of this financial bondage and turns the whole system on it&amp;#39;s head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truly decentralized cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize everything. It can allow for everyone&amp;#39;s vote to matter and have input on the changes society needs. It can allow for efficient and transparent tax allocation so anyone and everyone can audit and keep the system accountable to the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trustless and public block chains are the only way I see to get dark corporate money out of politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto isn&amp;#39;t just some novel niche tech, it has the potential to be the catalyst for economic and political revolution. If we can successfully integrate a truly decentralized financial protocol, it changes the dynamics of rich nations to poor nations, rich people to poor people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really hope humanity can use cryptocurrency to better society and eliminate the asymmetry&amp;#39;s of power that Corporations, and people like Janet Yellen abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
