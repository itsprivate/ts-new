And honestly, with Banano being the #1 team, that&amp;#39;s a huge accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We employed Folding@Home a worldwide distributed computing network where hundreds of thousands of volunteers around the world contributed computing power to create the world’s first exascale computing resource to compute the free energy of binding of all 20,000+ crowdsourced submissions&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We also thank the numerous volunteers that contributed compound designs to the COVID moonshot and to the citizen scientist volunteers of Folding@home for donating their computing resources, and Amazon Web Services for key support of Folding@home infrastructure&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.339317v3.full.pdf\"&gt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.339317v3.full.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
