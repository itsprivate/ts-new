Basically risk free. Yeah.. about that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Part 2: Shit implodes and claim you never said any of it.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f6v1m6diik191.jpg?width=1170&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=58a445f63ccb535e22893b141564e91e564885ba\"&gt;After calling it a risk free return, now he claims he never even understood it. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kwyg5wswhk191.jpg?width=1194&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=75792a6ccdd827a8eea546ce4b6e47aa67117fe7\"&gt;Suddenly, he was never involved.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oops, I dindu nuffin... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Part 3: Sad attempt to remove evidence&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only that, whats even more hilarious - his investment advisory/publishing media company Real Vision edited all their youtube videos where they talk about this coin and the 20% returns. Yeah.. they actually edited old youtube videos to remove those portions of the videos which talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l4jk14otik191.jpg?width=1914&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=885a7374970888c84bf5e4e5bd4c724f143886ee\"&gt;They now claim they have edited the video because \\&amp;quot;its a delicate matter\\&amp;quot;. LMAO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look Pal... lots of people recommended it. Some funds/VCs have openly said they made a mistake. They are still responsible but atleast they own up to it. But to literally say you didnt do what you did - thats utterly ridiculous and such a scum thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
