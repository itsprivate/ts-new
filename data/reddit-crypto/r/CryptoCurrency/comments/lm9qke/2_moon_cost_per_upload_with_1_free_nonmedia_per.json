And it&#39;s only gonna  get worse, and could lead to very strict measures like on WSB.</p>\n\n<p>But  a simple method would answer this, without being so harsh or so  elitist, and help with both Moon usage, and reducing spam and fluff.</p>\n\n<h1>Everyone gets 1 free non-media post(upload) per week.</h1>\n\n<h1>After that 2 Moons would be required and burned to be able to post (This does not apply to comments).</h1>\n\n<p>There  will still be the same current 2 post limit per day etc... So no one  with lots of Moons would be able to get high or unlimited posting.</p>\n\n<p>-There will be a cost in spamming memes, links, etc...</p>\n\n<p>-But the cost won&#39;t be too high, and not hinder legitimate posts.</p>\n\n<p>-There  will probably be more posts from people who have become regulars and  contributors, than new accounts and non contributors.</p>\n\n<p>-This will encourage more people to have vaults and use Moons.</p>\n\n<p>-If  you&#39;re gonna spend some of your Moons, you&#39;ll probably want to make  sure it&#39;s for a quality post that will get you your Moons back.</p>\n\n<p>-This will create more Moon usage, and more Moon burning, which will also create more value for Moons.</p>\n\n<p>I  think it&#39;s best to start with a very small amount first. If in the  future the community decides it&#39;s not enough or too much, future  proposals may change the amount</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/lm9qke\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
