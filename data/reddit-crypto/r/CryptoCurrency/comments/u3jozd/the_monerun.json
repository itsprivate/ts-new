Yes indeed, and here&amp;#39;s why:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monero&amp;#39;s obfuscated ledger has enabled a number of  exchanges to misrepresent their reserves, and sell XMR that they don&amp;#39;t actually have, knowing that all too many of us will never withdraw, and no one can see onchain the evidence of their misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well that all changes in 4 days. We&amp;#39;re busy pulling liquidity off exchanges, to force the issue. Already a number of exchanges have frozen XMR withdraws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I&amp;#39;ve got a little side pot ready to go on the 18th. When the tide goes out, we&amp;#39;ll see which exchanges serve their customers, and which exchanges abuse their customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope you join! Check out the xmrtrader and Monero sub&amp;#39;s for more info.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
