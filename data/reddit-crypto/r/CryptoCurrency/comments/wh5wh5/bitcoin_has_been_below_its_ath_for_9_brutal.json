An ATH at 69k was comical enough and then all the denial that we will still rally back up. Then the endless crabbing, ended by one of the biggest collapses in crypto, LUNA-UST implosion. Causing a dip to under 30k and below the past cycle ATH for Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to mention how many companies just went bankrupt in the past few weeks. Celsius, Voyager and 3AC and more to come for sure. Not to forget the thousands of hacks. The past few weeks could be the most intense movie ever made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just a congrats here to everyone getting through this and still feeling convicted. If you got this far don&amp;#39;t lose up on the last few meters hopefully. Everything has and end and this too will have an end, one day surely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
