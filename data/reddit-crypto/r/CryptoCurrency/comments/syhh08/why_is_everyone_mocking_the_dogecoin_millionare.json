Could it hurt anyone to congratulate the guy instead of poking fun at his misfortune? I mean he is still up 250k and never sold. I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but that is more money than I have ever made in crypto and the guy has genuine balls to risk 250k early on Dogecoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And incase you didn&amp;#39;t notice, the whole damn market is down at the moment not just memecoins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes he took a risk and yes i wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend anyone invest that much money on a memecoin, but it paid off for him and isn&amp;#39;t the whole damn point of investing in crypto to MAKE money? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should be uniting people in the crypto community not dividing them by making fun at them. I for one am happy for him. If he becomes a future multi millionare doge holder I hope he sets and example by being humble back to those smug people who relentlessly poked fun at his misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
