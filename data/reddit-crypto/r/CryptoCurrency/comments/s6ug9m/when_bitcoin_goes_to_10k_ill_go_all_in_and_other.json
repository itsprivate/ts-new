Then it goes to 40K and they say: Oh it&amp;#39;s going to 30K. When it goes to 30K, I&amp;#39;ll go all in!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it reaches 30K and they hope for 10K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The opposite also happens, with people saying: When Bitcoin reaches 50K, I&amp;#39;ll take profits. Then it reaches 50K and you wait for 60K to take profits. Then 70K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, Bitcoin has been at or below 10K &lt;strong&gt;for a decade&lt;/strong&gt;, why didn&amp;#39;t you go all in then? Maybe 40K is the lowest we ever go, who knows. But if you wanted to buy at 40K when we were at 60K, then buy at 40K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people say: When we get a bear market, then I&amp;#39;ll buy! But it&amp;#39;s kinda like: When it&amp;#39;s 2023, then I&amp;#39;ll start losing weight!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know there are exceptions and I know some people are very disciplined in their crypto goals. I know 100 people are going to reply to this: &amp;quot;Just DCA and HODL&amp;quot;. Yes, that&amp;#39;s fine, as long as you continue doing that during the bear market, and don&amp;#39;t capitulate then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if you were hoping for 40K when we were at 60K, don&amp;#39;t hope for 20K now, then you&amp;#39;ll never buy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
