People lost millions and now they are investing in a shitcoin in the hope to get that millions back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But there was an airdrop!? So they do&amp;#39;nt invest?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yea, but in order for the coin to be worth something, other people will have to invest and put money into it, and there are people that are actively doing so. These are most likely the same people that already were invested in Luna before and want to make more gains to cover their losses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they are gonna lose all of it. And there are already people celebrating the new blockchain by making claims like &lt;em&gt;biggest airdrop ever&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;most decentralized blockchain&lt;/em&gt; etc. People will never learn...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
