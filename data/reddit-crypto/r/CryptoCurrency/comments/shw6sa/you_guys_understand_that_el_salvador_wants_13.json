No international organization is going to make us do anything, anything at all!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys understand that the IMF isn&amp;#39;t just randomly going around demanding stuff, right? Most replies don&amp;#39;t seem to understand that. El Salvador has tried to get &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-economy-exclusive-idUSKBN2AW1GV\"&gt;$1.3 billion in funding from them&lt;/a&gt; for almost a year now. That&amp;#39;s a ton of money. And sure, edglord Bukele and his corrupt, idiotic government can keep their stance that nobody can &amp;quot;make them&amp;quot; do anything - but nobody is trying to force them to do anything. It&amp;#39;s more of a &amp;quot;yeah we won&amp;#39;t give you money as long as you are gambling with your economy in an irresponsible manner&amp;quot;. Which is a completely reasonable attitude. Why would they just give money to them without conditions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;El Salvador doesn&amp;#39;t hold any power here. They&amp;#39;re an irrelevant, tiny economy, the IMF couldn&amp;#39;t care less about them. If they want money, they&amp;#39;ll have to comply. Or the dictator once again makes a stupid decision for his country...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
