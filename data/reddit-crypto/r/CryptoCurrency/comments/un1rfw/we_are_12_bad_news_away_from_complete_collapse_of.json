Doing your own research is more important than ever&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Doing your own research wouldn&amp;#39;t do much in this environment - markets are in a tricky situation, globally, a very bad one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many projects will see MASSIVE corrections and many would not survive so be even more careful.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, with that aside, let&amp;#39;s dive in a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A significant downside risk still persists in the market and if (god forbid) another 1-2 bad news hit the market, we may end up seeing that downside - it may mean a &amp;lt;$10K BTC and &amp;lt;$1K ETH. Terra is already down 90% with its own bad news and market will not be nice to any assets if bad news keep hitting. Right now, likelihood of bad news is more than the good news. Russia-Ukraine situation can escalate beyond the two countries, China real estate is a ticking bomb, China lockdown may extend further, another major covid variant can set things really back etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The V-shape recovery from this crash is highly unlikely, no major stimulus plan is waiting this market crash at the end of the tunnel, this market crash is good for the government because it will tame down the inflation. So don&amp;#39;t try to outsmart the market with short term trades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, don&amp;#39;t fall for shitty and shady YouTubers and Crypto influencers on Twitter - nobody understands the market and macro signals are more geared towards downside risk than upside optimism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS IN EXECUTING ANY TRADE!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good news - this shall pass too and we will emerge stronger with a bigger crypto market (shooting to $5-10T) but have patience and wait and watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God bless us all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
