There are a lot of other issues they could focus on that have a way larger impact on climate change than BTC. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you see the private jet fleet that flew all the billionaires to Davos? The same people telling you to eat bugs and ban mining are flying around on private jets. Private jet flights produce around 33.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year. Whereas Bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3h2i3qriph491.png?width=1744&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1945404b910c96980fda8c2695d4f676b1cf61b7\"&gt;The actual fleet of jets at Davos 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So all these people preaching about the impact of mining, better start rolling up on bicycles if they want us to listen. Get off your carbon emission-filled soap boxes, billionaires. In actuality, 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/davos-guests-private-jets-climate-crisis-2020-1\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://peri.umass.edu/greenhouse-100-polluters-index-current\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
