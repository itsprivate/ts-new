Harmony have disabled the bridge for the time being and prices of various assets on Harmony have completely shit the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a post over 6 months ago Vitalik outlined the dangers of cross chain bridges:&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, imaging what happens if you move  100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to get 100 Solana-WETH, and then  Ethereum gets 51% attacked. The attacker deposited a bunch of their own  ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum  side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract  is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now  only worth 60 ETH. Even if there&amp;#39;s a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that  fully validates consensus, it&amp;#39;s still vulnerable to theft through 51%  attacks like this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For  this reason, it&amp;#39;s always safer to hold Ethereum-native assets on  Ethereum or Solana-native assets on Solana than it is to hold  Ethereum-native assets on Solana or Solana-native assets on Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just an excerpt from the post but the whole thing is really worth a read. It explains the inherent risk and dangers involved in cross-chain bridges. Now more than ever I think it&amp;#39;s important to remind people that tokenized &amp;quot;wrapped&amp;quot; assets on other chains are *not* the same as having the token on the native chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
