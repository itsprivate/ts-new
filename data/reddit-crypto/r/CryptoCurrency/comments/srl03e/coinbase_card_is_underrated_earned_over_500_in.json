But it’s actually really easy. They mail you a card (and link a card using Apple Pay if you have an iPhone) and then you simply just use that as opposed to your normal debit card. Transferring from your bank account to your Coinbase account is literally instantaneous. It’s quick, easy, and convenient. If you’re on the fence, just get one!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/WYhTK1H/\"&gt;Proof of over $500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Forgot to mention. It’s 4% cashback on every purchase&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
