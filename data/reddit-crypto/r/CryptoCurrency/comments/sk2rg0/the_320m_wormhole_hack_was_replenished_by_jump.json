  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Wormhole bridge one of Solana&amp;#39;s biggest bridges lost $320m in a hack. Within hours, a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d\"&gt;Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana &amp;quot;ecosystem&amp;quot; is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Solana goes down - over night fix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
