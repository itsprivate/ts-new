I&#39;m posting it today because I had trouble accessing it all.</p>\n\n<p>Like it says on the title: last year I just happened to have $50 to spare and, instead of adding it to my other crypto investments, I decided to have a little fun and invest on coins with a low market value that no one seemed to know about (at the time anyways). I swore to myself that I would not check on their progress until a full year had passed.</p>\n\n<p>Why October 3rd? Because I knew I&#39;d remember it due to all the Mean Girls and FMA memes, that&#39;s why.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, without further ado, here are the ten coins and how much money they&#39;ve made me since:</p>\n\n<p><strong>#1: Polkastarter (POLS)</strong> is a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Polkadot for token pools and auctions. Its value rose <strong>208.3%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$10.41</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#2: Flamingo (FLM)</strong> aims to unleash the full potential of DeFi, a crucial component on which to base the Neo Smart Economy. Its value rose <strong>21.4%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$1.07</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#3: Tellor (TRB)</strong> is a decentralized oracle network that allows smart contracts on Ethereum to securely connect to external data sources. Its value rose <strong>162.4%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$8.12</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#4: Qtum (QTUM)</strong> is a cryptocurrency which uses a proof-of-stake consensus model for creating new blocks, which is far easier and less energy-intensive than Bitcoin&#39;s proof-of-work model. Its value rose <strong>509.8%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$25.49</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#5: Polymath (POLY)</strong> is an Ethereum token that aims to facilitate digital securities trading on the Polymath platform. Its value rose <strong>2031.2%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$101.56</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#6: Stellar (XLM)</strong> is a decentralized protocol on open-source code to transfer digital currency to fiat money domestically and across borders. Its value rose <strong>343.4%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$17.16</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#7: Monero (XMR)</strong> uses a public distributed ledger with privacy-enhancing technologies that obfuscate transactions to achieve anonymity and fungibility. Its value rose <strong>149.8%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$7.49</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#8: Serum (SRM)</strong> is a decentralized exchange software built on Solana where cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold by traders. Its value rose <strong>470.8%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$23.54</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#9: Avalanche (AVAX)</strong> is a platform for creating custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). Its value rose <strong>1599.8%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$79.99</strong> extra.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, the last coin, which gave me astronomical returns, and which makes me incredibly sad I didn&#39;t put more money into it. But oh well. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#10: Gala (GALA)</strong> is a platform that builds a range of blockchain-powered games, each of which provides players with true ownership of their in-game items through the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its value rose a wooping <strong>12153.9%</strong> in the past year, earning me <strong>$607.695</strong> goddamn extra.</p>\n\n<p>So... yeah, that was wild. Notice how there was nothing but profit. If you invest in crypto and leave it alone for a year, it will almost surely be nothing but profits. I love crypto because of that.</p>\n\n<p>It was fun! I&#39;ll probably do the same right now, and come back in a year with another post like this :D</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
