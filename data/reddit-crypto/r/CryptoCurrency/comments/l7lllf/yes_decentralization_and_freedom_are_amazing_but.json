That&#39;s kinda the whole point. You can send money to anyone, anytime. You can trade on centralized platforms or directly peer-to-peer. It&#39;s totally up to you.</p>\n\n<p>If some exchange prevents trading, you can always trade somewhere else. They can&#39;t stop decentralized networks. If you hold your own keys (cryptography that allows you to send and receive funds), you have freedom to do whatever you want with your money.</p>\n\n<p>But... pump and dump groups are not good. <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> is <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> a pump and dump group.</p>\n\n<p>Cryptocurrencies have seen their fair share of pumps and dumps. The distributed nature of them mean that anyone can attempt these at any time. Experienced cryptocurrency traders are extremely familiar with them, since they happen all the time. It&#39;s normal to see random &quot;altcoins&quot; appreciate or depreciate more than 100% in a single day. That&#39;s normal here. Everything is 100x.</p>\n\n<p>We encourage you to learn about cryptocurrencies and to take advantage of their freedom and censorship-resistant properties. But please, follow our rules. Us moderators take the role of preventing manipulation here (of all types) extremely seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> Moderation Team</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Do you have no idea how cryptocurrencies and blockchains work? Don&#39;t panic. Everyone needs to start somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Have 25 minutes and want a laugh?
