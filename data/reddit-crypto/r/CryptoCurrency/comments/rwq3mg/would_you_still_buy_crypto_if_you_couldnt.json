But it got me thinking: if you &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; never sell your crypto for fiat, would people still buy it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a thought experiment.&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, you couldn&amp;#39;t exchange crypto for fiat, ever - but it&amp;#39;s not just that exchanges wouldn&amp;#39;t offer it, there would be no loophole (&lt;strong&gt;edit: so also no crypto credit/debit cards&lt;/strong&gt;) for it. You, for some reason, could not find someone to privately sell your coin to for fiat. In this hypothetical world, everything would be the same as now - you could buy crypto with fiat, you could use crypto for their use cases, and you could even use crypto to buy stuff in the few places that enable it - but you could not get fiat for it. This means, you would either have to have a use case for crypto that isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;getting more money&amp;quot;, or you would have to speculate on more adoption and more merchants accepting crypto in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you still invest in crypto? I&amp;#39;ll be honest: I&amp;#39;m in this to make more fiat, if I couldn&amp;#39;t exhange crypto for fiat I would not invest. What about you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
