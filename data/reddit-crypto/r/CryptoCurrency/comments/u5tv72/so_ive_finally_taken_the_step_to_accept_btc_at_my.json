I also have added it to my invoices and even mention it as a payment mention to anyway who asks over the phone/in person. I have a 10% discount for any invoice paid in Bitcoin for the first 10 customers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s been 6 months now and every time without fail it is “I’ll pay by card please”. Not one person has shown any interest in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s strange because in the circles I’m in (including this sub), crypto is a part of every day life and it’s easy to think this carries over to the general public.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For now at least I think we are still so far away from mainstream adoption. Especially with my usual customer stereotype - 40’s and somewhat successful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep trying and see how it goes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I need to start accepting doge and get to work fixing scooters instead!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: doge not dodge - autocorrect but it’s not far wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
