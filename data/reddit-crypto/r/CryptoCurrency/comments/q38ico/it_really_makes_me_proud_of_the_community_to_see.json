Just look at the top of this post next to my name: I too have showered and boy am I squeaky clean and proud to bear the badge 👌 look around you, everyone is at it and I’m pleased to see just how many internet degenerates take their daily hygiene so seriously. Cleanliness is, after all next to godliness. This is the kind of thing that really brings the community together folks! </p>\n\n<p>Ok jokes aside, it’s genuinely cool to see how many people here are bearing their governance poll voting badges - and that folks, genuinely is something to be proud of! Not mention the Moons bonus you get for voting. Just imagine if we got paid for turning out to vote in the real political process… </p>\n\n<p>Well, congrats everyone and wear your governance badge with pride!</p>\n\n<p>Now go and take a shower you filthy degenerates…</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
