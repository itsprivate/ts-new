It helps you mentally and also it is in my opinion the best call for a long term hodler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, I have been sipping coffee watching Reddit go nuts and keeping calm as hell because I have Ethereum staked, CRO staked for the card and in their DeFi Earn (all locked) and the rest of coins I have them staked and all these secured with a hardware wallet which I genuinely find it too much of a hassle to get to start using again for the sake of panic selling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is just better to watch the world burn while you know it will eventually heal up again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stake your coins, earn interest and lock it up for a while. It will help you A LOT mentally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOTE: any PoW hodlers (unstakable coins obviously), try to get them into a DeFi earning system like Compound or Aave. Any centralised ones can be Nexo&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
