I looked into it as it seemed too good to be true but the project seemed sustainable, at least for a few more months. I mean iron finance was not a new name, it was previously on BSC before making the switch. plus fucking Mark Cuban endorsed it.</p>\n\n<p>I bought in with 500$ worth, I know its not a lot but it was 1/4 of my total portfolio so its a lot for me. within days TITAN skyrocketed to 60$ and I was making profits of over 50$ daily. I could&#39;ve and should&#39;ve cashed out then, but I didnt.  I wanted just ONE MORE day of the juicy rewards then I&#39;d cash out. </p>\n\n<p>I went to sleep last night and when I woke up this morning, to my horror the price was tanked. I could&#39;ve walked away with 1000$ yesterday but now I&#39;m walking away with 0. this is because I was too greedy and wanted one more day of profits, and then the rug got pulled ( more of a bank run but still).</p>\n\n<p>now, I know this was my fault and I&#39;ve taken a valuable lesson from this. NEVER get too greedy in anything, especially if you are a trader or farmer. many have lost far, far more than me and I feel for them. but the common factor with all of us who lost is greed. if something seems too good to be true it probably is.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not bothering with liquidity farms now, I&#39;ll concentrate on making fiat to recoup my losses and focus on investing.</p>\n\n<p>i hope my experience teaches you a lesson, and I hope no one makes the same mistake as me in the future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
