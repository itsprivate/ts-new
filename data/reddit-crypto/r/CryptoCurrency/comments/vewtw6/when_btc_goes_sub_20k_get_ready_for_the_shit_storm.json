As it is, people are freaking out and exchanges are “slowing” dumping, I can see this decline very hard in the next few days. Nobody can predict anything, I’m just giving my very anecdotal analysis of the predictable human condition: media creates uncertainty, humans in fear, media “confirms” uncertainty, humans panic, humans always choose themselves first = “sell while you can” mentality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brace yourselves. 3 days tops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion only.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
