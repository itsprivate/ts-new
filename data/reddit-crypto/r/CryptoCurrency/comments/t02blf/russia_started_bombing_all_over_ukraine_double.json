So that means there is a full scale war now in the country. That also means worldwide economic tensions caused by further supply chain shortages, war effort, and overall volatility from the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A reminder for crypto new comers who are getting absolutely pantsed and turned around right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Selling at a loss historically makes no sense. Overtime crypto and the overall stock market and real estate. It all bounces back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time in the market over timing it. Instead of thinking you know what’s gonna happen. Just buy some here and there. And in 2025 maybe we we all be better off for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of that being said I’m so sorry if you live in Ukraine I cannot even imagine being a smaller country being brutally attacked by a large and vicious neighbor with no remorse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fight if you want, escape if you can. Russia kills civilians and supporters of anything western. Just a week ago the US exposed a list of Ukrainians Russians were to kill and put in camps after an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don’t think it cannot happen. Be safe and be smart. Fight hard the Russians are just people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
