They are very different from each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While Bitcoin has been seen as a currency by most and even is accepted as one in some countries. Ethereum clearly is not a currency of you just look at the fees but even if the fees get lower, it&amp;#39;s still not a currency. Ethereum is meant to be about smart contracts and decentralized applications in crypto and as we can see ETH had a very huge ecosystem around that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comparing them both is stupid because at the end of the day both will prevail and be successful together and more importantly both are needed for Cryptos future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
