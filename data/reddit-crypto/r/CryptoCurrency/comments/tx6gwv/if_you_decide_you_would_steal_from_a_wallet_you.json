I think this is monumentally fucked up and shows how desperate and immoral a lot of people are. If you decide you&amp;#39;d steal someone else&amp;#39;s money given a chance and consider this a lottery ticket, then you are no different at all from the hackers and scammers that have ruined peoples lives. Apart from the intelligence of being able to directly carry off a plan to complete such a goal. To complain about anything revolving around a hack or a rug pull in the future would be the epitome of hypocrisy. So don&amp;#39;t complain. Instead, endorse and show your true colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
