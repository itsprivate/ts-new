So, we probably won&amp;#39;t see BTC going down below USD 19,970. This is why this current bear market is interesting. We are seeing possibly a &lt;strong&gt;lowering in the drawdown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bear market is getting more and more bearable. Pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, if you had entered into crypto this year, then the next point of exit should be by the next halving in 2024/2025. Although the current halving hasn&amp;#39;t met the expectations yet, the previous halving would suggest that the metrics is rather promising. If you&amp;#39;re concerned about the stock-to-flow model not meeting the prediction this time, consider that BTC had exceeded the stock-to-flow prices previously as well. It will eventually balances out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, you do need to pay additional considerations if you&amp;#39;re jumping into alts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
