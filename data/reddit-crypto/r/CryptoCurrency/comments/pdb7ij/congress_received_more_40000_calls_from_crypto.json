This bill is quite stupid, and it is clear that the people who designed it do not understand cryptocurrency. They define Brokers much too broadly, and would require KYC for a ridiculous amount of users.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, the Crypto community was quite outraged about this. There were many posts and comments asking people to call their local senators. </p>\n\n<p>From the article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Digital Rights organization Fight for The Future said that it saw <strong>more than 40,000</strong> calls to congress ahead of the Senate Infrastructure vote.  </p>\n\n<p>“I think it’s the first time that lawmakers have taken crypto seriously on a broad scale, so we’re able to have a different level of conversation than we’ve been able to have in the past because they know that so many of their constituents care.”   </p>\n\n<p>-Kristin Smith</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am disappointed that they voted to pass the bill anyways, but at least our voices were heard. I am proud of y&#39;all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
