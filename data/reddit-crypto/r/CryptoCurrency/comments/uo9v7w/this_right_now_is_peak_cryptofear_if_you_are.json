You are literally surviving one of the biggest bear markets in Crypto history while reading this, you are actually one of the last ones still actively being here. That&amp;#39;s called a holder and not someone who holds during 1000% gains. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But obviously it&amp;#39;s not bad either if you need to catch some fresh air outside of the markets. Because at the end of the day your health is more important than Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
