Like 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So of course everyone who have invested more than they could afford to lose are uncertain what to do so expect to a lot of posts like, even though it keeps being said that you should only invest what wouldn&amp;#39;t affect your financial situation if you lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a huge difference between losing 10k or $1000, so of course you&amp;#39;d prefer losing less and not being affected by the crash, or possibly a bear market which won&amp;#39;t recover for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also a great time to buy in my opinion, even though I&amp;#39;m just speculating as everyone else and we might drop to 10k&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
