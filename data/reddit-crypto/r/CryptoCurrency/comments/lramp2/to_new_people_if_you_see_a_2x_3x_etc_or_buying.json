Case and point, <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lr9fwe/this_is_all_i_have_im_scared_to_lose_everything_i/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">this post</a> on bitcoin sub</p>\n\n<p>This guy went all in with all the money he had, he thought he was just buying btc with his money, he didn&#39;t realize it was a margin account with 3x leverage, he didn&#39;t even know what margin is. His position got closed out once and he opened another position, still not knowing that he was playing with borrowed money. </p>\n\n<p>To put in short and simple terms, what margin is:</p>\n\n<p>Margin is literally borrowed money. \nLet&#39;s say you put 1000$ in and it&#39;s a margin account with 3x leverage. That means your broker lends you 2000$ and your buying power is 3000$. </p>\n\n<p>You buy btc with 3k, btc dips 33.3%, so your 3k has gone down to 2k, the exchange/broker pulls out the 2k by closing your position and you&#39;re left with nothing. </p>\n\n<p>If you had bought 1k worth of btc without margin, for you to go to nothing, btc has to go down to nothing aka, go down 100%. </p>\n\n<p>The higher the leverage (2x, 3x, 10x), the smaller the % dip required to wipe you out. </p>\n\n<p>So if you see, words like <strong>buying power, margin, leverage or 2x, 3x, etc</strong> where you&#39;re buying, you&#39;ve accidentally opened up a margin account, and its not a simple buy, you&#39;re opening up a long position with borrowed money.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: On binance, currency pairs might have little 5x, 10x, etc written next to them which just simply denotes the max leverage available with those pairs. If you&#39;re on binance, as long as the top part of page says spot and the buy sell buttons aren&#39;t replaced with buy/long &amp; sell/short buttons you&#39;re fine. Binance does require you to pass a small quiz to do leverage trading if you accidentally stumble onto the margin page. Many less popular exchanges don&#39;t have this tiny barrier. Many exchanges are completely for margin trading and there&#39;s no spot option.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
