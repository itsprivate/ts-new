But as much as I hate to admit it, I&amp;#39;m bored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is predictable,  I know Bitcoins gonna be crabbing till it breaks 50K, and even then it&amp;#39;s only luck if we can sustain the profit takers and push to another all-time high. I&amp;#39;m not invested enough to be happy when BTC reaches a new all-time high, but I&amp;#39;m also not sad if BTC crashes to 20K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how did you guys who managed to go through multiple bear markets stay in the &amp;quot;game&amp;quot;. I would be pleased to learn some tips should you have any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention that I have a life outside of crypto and it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I&amp;#39;m bored, I find it hard to come back to crypto and do some research on new coins, tech, etc. I don&amp;#39;t feel motivated at all, so all these comments about &amp;quot;getting a life&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t helping.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
