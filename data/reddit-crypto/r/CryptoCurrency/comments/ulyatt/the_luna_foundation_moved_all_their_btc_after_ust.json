It will probably recover this time around because they got the BTC to sell or lend, but this just proves that UST isn&amp;#39;t the great stablecoin that this sub portraits it at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be careful with UST going forward, this definitely won&amp;#39;t be the last time that it&amp;#39;s briefly losing it&amp;#39;s peg and one day it might not recover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: 37,000 BTC that originated from the Luna foundation wallet is being transferred to Gemini exchange&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/2195e45c27826de5ea6086ea5d35d0c00485079910d24b8dd96972f8d7faa7e0\"&gt;https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/2195e45c27826de5ea6086ea5d35d0c00485079910d24b8dd96972f8d7faa7e0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
