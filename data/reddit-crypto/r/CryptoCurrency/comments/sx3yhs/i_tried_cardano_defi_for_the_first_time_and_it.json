So please keep an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Installed Nami wallet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Started a withdrawal of just 5 Ada from Kraken to this wallet, it took 30 minutes (??) for funds to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Went to SundaeSwap, tried to swap 1 Ada for 1.4 Sundae but kept saying that I have insufficient funds, apparently Sundae has additional fees that I was not aware of (2.5 Ada + some refundable deposit of 2 Ada).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waited another 30 minutes to withdraw more Ada.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big red warning on the Sundae page that the network is heavily congested. Checked the explorer and blocks were indeed (85%+) full while running at 2 tps. How is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First 4 swap attempts failed with 0 warnings, nothing to be found on-chain in the explorer, just pending attempts that disappeared after reconnecting my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 5th one I think was recorded on-chain and remained in pending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;40 minutes later another on-chain swap attempt magically appeared, probably from the first 4 &amp;quot;failed&amp;quot; txs. Wtf?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tried to cancel this second order...cancellation pending with 0 feedback on what is happening, tried to cancel 3 more times... nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exactly one hour and 7 minutes later the first swap completed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m used to getting near instant confirmations and swaps on other networks, 1 hour+ is definitelly the longest I&amp;#39;ve ever had to wait on any Dex by a factor of 1000x and combined with all the fails and weird behaviour that I got I can&amp;#39;t call this a good UX. What exactly went so wrong and what&amp;#39;s the solution? Please don&amp;#39;t call me a fudder because none of this is made up and anyone can try it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
