The total transaction fee costing 50 ALGO. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now whether you have a bag of ALGO or not, its good to see what is possible with crypto and can only be seen as a positive for us all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those that aren&amp;#39;t aware, the rewards were around 3.5% for the 3 month locked period - that&amp;#39;s 14.75%APR. Again, this is only another positive for us all. Its well above inflation and considerably more than any bank would offer in a standard savings account. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The deadline for the second round of Governance is the 6th January, so if you&amp;#39;re thinking about locking it in until the end of March you&amp;#39;ve got a couple of days left (depending where you are in the world).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
