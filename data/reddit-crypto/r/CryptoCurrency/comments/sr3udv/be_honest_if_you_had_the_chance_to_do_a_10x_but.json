  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a discussion with a friend, I recently found myself asking a somewhat philosophical question about crypto. I like to think I&amp;#39;m in it for the tech, and I think most of my investments reflect that (I&amp;#39;m pretty much all in on ETH at this point), but of course I&amp;#39;d like to make money. And as everyone knows, the best way to make a quick buck in crypto is to flip sh*tcoins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s my question: if I had the chance to make a 10x, but in order to do so I had to buy a token that is clearly a ponzi, would I do it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not talking about a project with utility that could fail ; I&amp;#39;m talking about a genuine cash grab.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On one hand, I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel so good about participating in this kind of operation. It&amp;#39;s the kind of things that gives the entire ecosystem a bad reputation. But on the other hand... This is a free market, and if people want to throw their money at me without DYOR, then that&amp;#39;d be their fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All things considered, I think I would not do it. But I&amp;#39;ve never been tested, so it&amp;#39;s easy for me to say this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was wondering what do you think about this. Would you sleep well doing a 10x knowing other people got scammed? Would you simply refuse to participate?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
