And what happened to the truckers is honestly maddening no matter what you think of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad this year DeFi is back on the rise and a lot of protocols are investing millions into the platform and trying to make it a better place like Bitdao, it creates more hope for more decentralization in the future because everyday shows that DeFi is needed or these unruly displays of government power will continue to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
