Additionally, no one believed in me and ___<em>(add something personal and dark that just happened, e.g. my wife left me)</em>____ . But thanks to god, I discovered crypto and this subreddit <em>(Mentioning this sub grants +23% upvotes)</em>. I know that I might be late in the game but ____<em>(try to arouse a bit of pity/compassion from the reader)</em>____ but overall, I&#39;m a good boi. <em>(Showing that you are a good person -&gt; +12% upvotes).</em> I know that my story might seems ____<em>(go with the traditional &#39;I&#39;m a standard guy and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on\\</em>)* but I just wanted to ____<em>(finally, finish with something humble stating you you are just here to share and you don&#39;t want anything)</em>____.</p>\n\n<p>*If well made, showing that you are a noob will awake the &#39;teaching desire&#39; of the most experimented users of this sub. They are hard to reach but if you get them -&gt; x3.2 Moons multiplier.</p>\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key points :</strong></p>\n\n<p>-Never mention any crypto! NEVER! Everyone tries to shill his own bag. You don&#39;t want to start a war.</p>\n\n<p>-Add a pinch of humor to contrast the dark side of your post. It will balance your story and will emphasize your &#39;good boi side&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>-Keep in mind that you need to target the broader audience possible. Good luck!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
