You know that when you go to bed and when you wake up in the morning something will have changed in your portfolio; things jump up or fall off of a cliff our of nowhere and you&amp;#39;re just lying there thinking about what you&amp;#39;re going to buy when it all works out (because it feels like an inevitability); you wake up and shrug off the -5% because you&amp;#39;re sure that eventually it&amp;#39;ll be made up, and it might not even take that long because of how quickly things seem to gain or lose momentum. At first it&amp;#39;s stressful but if you stick around you develop a kind of gallows humour where you just laugh and wait for the next day to come around to throw more coins into the money pit. Because one day you know you&amp;#39;ll have enough for that little impractical squashed-looking yellow car.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
