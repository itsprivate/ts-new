Market buying the shorted 6,800 BTC opened at that price </p>\n\n<p>if Bulls get control we will be looking at a $42,000 BTC. Then a slow climb to $50,000</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Up another 13% since I posted. They are really trying to push the price down </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Up another 30% since posting (90% now). Jesus they really want BTC to crash but its holding $36,000.00. Go Go BTC </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Bulls just jumped in 4% increase in long (Including me). Shorts up another 3.5%. To put this into context a total of ~7000BTC was just shorted worth $210 Million in 30 mins </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Up 105%; Jesus how much money do these fuckers have </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Up another 5% in 6mins, 110% increase! I&#39;m all in BTC Kraken, Coinbase and 3X on Binance. Out of cash 100%+ all in hope someone is still buying</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Bulls up 0.9%, Shorts 5.9% (116%). BTC $36,600.00.00+ </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I can&#39;t believe it these fuckers just broke 120% increase in less than a hour. 15,000 BTC worth $450million. But BTC at $36,800+ GO GO BTC </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Longs showing weakness down 0.2%; people just got liquidated. Short sellers have unlimited funds it seems up another 5% (125%). Satoshi give me strength out of fiat  to buy   </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Now at 132%+ (1000BTC /$36 Million shorts opened in last ~30mins). BTC still above $36K. I went all in buying BTC, but put a stop loss at 1% loss of account on all trades. Now all I can do is wait and hope I don&#39;t lose money </p>\n\n<p>Edit: These fuckers are at 143%. They literally just shorted BTC nearly half a billion in about 2 hours</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Twitter to see all the Short liquidations occurring; enjoy the show <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whalecalls?s=09\">https://twitter.com/whalecalls?s=09</a></p>\n\n<p>Personally have a short open on ICX with a stop loss at $1.07 and holding 25% of my portfolio in BTC. Either way its going to be a interesting and profitable US session. Edit Closed my short sending to BTC</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
