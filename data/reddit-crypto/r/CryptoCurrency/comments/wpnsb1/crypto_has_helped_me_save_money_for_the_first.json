I&amp;#39;m an impulse spender,  and whenever my paycheck came it would go to Take-out/booze,  useless stuff or gaming. A friend suggested I buy in the dip in July,  I was a little late but I still got in pretty low and now for the past month I&amp;#39;ve been throwing every spare cent I have into eth/bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know everyone says you shouldn&amp;#39;t put more money in than you are willing to lose,  but this money would have been wasted anyway,  right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now the proud owner of almost half an eth and about a quarter of that in bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really hoping for a nice pump in the coming months so that I can take the money out and buy an engagement ring for my girlfriend, and start over with my crypto investments again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone in the sub for all the information and tips over the past month,  I&amp;#39;ve been following the daily discussions and checking up for new info every couple of hours,  and I think I&amp;#39;m really starting to get the hang of all of this. (although I know there is still a lot to learn) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers everyone! I appreciate you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
