That&amp;#39;s a lot of time we suffered here, a lot more than during the May crash. As this was a slow burn bear market steadily dropping like 10% each. That&amp;#39;s usually more pain than a 30% drop at once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we gotta stick in there get through all those loops to see the amazing view afterwards and just be able to say &amp;quot;yeah I was there one day&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t know about you guys but I personally did not check my portfolio since November. Also my chart watching has drastically reduced. But now slowly getting back. The pain is there when crypto drops like 10%, then jumps 5% to put in hope but then drops 10% again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be afraid of that. Think of the day you will be there in the major bull market and tell all those newbies that you went through all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
