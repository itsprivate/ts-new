I spent them about a week later for diamonds in a minecraft server.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you might be wondering why I wouldn&#39;t regret spending what is now worth half a million dollars on fake rocks in a videogame, but the more I&#39;ve thought about the more I&#39;ve realized:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At $3 bitcoin still felt like a fun experiment. I had NO idea what I had. </li>\n<li>More importantly, let&#39;s say I kept those coins. When Bitcoin hit $20 I would have been tempted to sell. When it hit $100 I would have been verrry tempted to sell. $1,000? I&#39;d cash out for sure. There are so many milestones where I and many of us thought it was topping out where I without question would have so;d, especially in the early years. The likelihood of me keeping those coins for a decade with the assumption that today&#39;s prices were even possible at all is extremely unlikely. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So ultimately don&#39;t beat yourself up if you sold some coins for lower prices than we see today. You made a decision that was probably right for whenever you made it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
