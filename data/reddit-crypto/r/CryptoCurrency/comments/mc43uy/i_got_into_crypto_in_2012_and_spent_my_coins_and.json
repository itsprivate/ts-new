So, when I accumulated some crypto through mining, I would find ways to spend the coins without converting to cash. I paid for flights a few times a year in BTC through Expedia, even rental cars and hotels. I would buy new electronics with crypto directly, including a second mining rig I bought with dogecoin. When I wanted to buy my first motorcycle, I found a seller that accepted BTC for the bike. I bought a new TV in BTC too. Do I wish I held all those coins that would be worth millions now? No! I believe that my spending of the coins I earned was my way of adding legitimacy to crypto by using I as a currency instead of a commodity. Obviously I still hold for savings and investments but I will continue to find ways to spend my crypto instead of cashing out. </p>\n\n<p>All that being said, I am going to buy a Tesla now that they accept BTC. What a time to be alive</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
