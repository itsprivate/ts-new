  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, the second half of the title is slight clickbait (but true)&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been three different Bitcoin symbols in use since its inception. The original one was designed by Satoshi and looked &lt;a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Bitcoin_old.png\"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt; - a picture made out of a few pixels, depicting a gold coin with &amp;quot;BC&amp;quot; on it, looking really, really awful. I think it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting that Satoshi himself designed the logo as a gold coin, as I&amp;#39;ve seen many people complain over the years if the media illustrate stories about crypto with physical coins with crypto logos on them, because that&amp;#39;s a wrong depiction. I always thought that was weird criticism - it&amp;#39;s difficult to illustrate crypto stories, are they supposed to print a picture of code if they need a picture? - but it&amp;#39;s interesting that Satoshi himself used a physical coin as a logo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second design was also by Satoshi and was presented on the Bitcointalk forum &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130524055823/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0\"&gt;on February 24, 2010&lt;/a&gt; (archived version because the pictures don&amp;#39;t work with the current one). It&amp;#39;s closer to the current one, still a gold coin, but with the ₿ on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third and final design, the white ₿ on orange background, was presented about 8 months later, on &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130525203057/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0;all\"&gt;November 1, 2010&lt;/a&gt; (again, archived version for the same reason as above) on Bitcointalk - by Bitboy. Okay, not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Bitboy, but a forum user with that name on Bitcointalk. Seemingly a pretty random user that only made a few posts on the forum. Crazy to think that the logo of a trillion-dollar-asset was not designed by a graphic designer but by a random guy on a forum. He said he was inspired by the Mastercard logo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the current logo still looks quite good almost 12 years later, and I&amp;#39;m glad we didn&amp;#39;t stick with the Satoshi logos!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
