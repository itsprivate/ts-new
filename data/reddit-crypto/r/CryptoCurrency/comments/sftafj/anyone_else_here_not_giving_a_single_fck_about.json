Why?\nBecause I strongly believe that we are still at the beginning ot this long journey. If you are someone who believes in crypto patience is the key. Im not a gambler. Im an investor. And as an investor, holding the assets that you truly believe in, is much easier during volatile times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gamblers who threw in a massive portion of their bank accounts and see them going down in a few days are likely angry or already moved on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cant help but feel perfectly fine despite the volatility. Id be lying if I said that Id be happier to get more sats for less fiat but keep that dca on dips and itll pay off in the end&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
