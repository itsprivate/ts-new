Don&#39;t get complacent. Part of the responsibility we have with cryptocurrency is to <strong>self-manage</strong>. If this is to replace the current banking system, we need to understand how important it is to uphold security of our wallets and our private keys.</p>\n\n<p>TL: DR;  </p>\n\n<p>Do not click on <strong>ANY</strong> Google ad search suggestions under <strong>ANY</strong> circumstance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
