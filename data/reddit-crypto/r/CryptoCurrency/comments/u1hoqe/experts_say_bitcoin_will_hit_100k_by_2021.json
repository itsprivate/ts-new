Not only that, but let&amp;#39;s talk to everyone we know and convince them to FOMO all their money in Bitcoin. What could go wrong, we have the word of experts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly though, I&amp;#39;m already seeing articles about how Bitcoin will hit $100k by the end of 2022 and it feels like the same thing again that happened last year, namely, people expecting crazy gains because Bitcoin has moved up like 5%. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this again will cause people invest in Bitcoin and expect to be rich by the end of the year, which is very unlikely, so they&amp;#39;ll definitely be disappointed. I would say that we shouldn&amp;#39;t really care how much Bitcoin will be this week, this month, or even this year. Why look at short term? Not like short term works with Bitcoin, because it&amp;#39;s become a little stable compared to alts, and even they&amp;#39;re not as volatile anymore to get you a lot of profits short term. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin won&amp;#39;t get you rich Short term, it&amp;#39;s best to have patience and invest and wait. No, Waiting doesn&amp;#39;t mean checking the charts every second of the day, simply DCA if you already do or forget about your investment. Patience does pay off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
