I was obviously prepared for spam bots etc. But still the amount of people that claimed that their low-cap coin, no one knows about with a 100M market cap or so, is 100% safe was just outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many claimed that some low-cap coin they invested in will definitely be successful in the future and is actually 100% safe. The sad thing is that many seemed like they are not even a bot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that Crypto won&amp;#39;t crash into disappearance and actually survive but there is absolutely no guarantee that it will be profitable, especially with low-cap coins. That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s: higher risk, higher rewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously a low cap coin no one knows about could possibly end up being very successful for you. So investing is not wrong. But you should know that there are probably hundreds of Cryptos doing the same thing, solving the same problem. So it&amp;#39;s very hard to find something legit and uniquely new nowadays in Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
