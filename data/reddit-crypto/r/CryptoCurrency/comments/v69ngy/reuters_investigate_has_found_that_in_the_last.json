In a recurring pattern, as published by Reuters investigation report, Binance has helped launder money originating from scams, hacks, investment frauds, illegal drug sales, a foreign exchange violation case among others in the last five years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S.  government also hired crypto researcher Chainalysis,  to monitor illegal flows, and it was reported that Binance received criminal funds totaling $770 million in 2019 alone, another report by Crystal Blockchain,  showed that a Russian-language site called Hydra, used Binance to make and receive crypto payments worth $780 million.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reuters calculated from an examination of court records, statements by law enforcement and blockchain data, compiled for the news agency by two blockchain analysis firms. Two industry experts reviewed the calculation and agreed with the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Binance declined to make Zhao available for an interview. Responding to written questions, Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann said Binance did not consider Reuters’ calculation to be accurate. &lt;strong&gt;He did not respond to requests to provide Binance’s own figures for the cases identified in this article.&lt;/strong&gt; He said Binance was building “the most sophisticated cyber forensics team on the planet” and was seeking to “further improve our ability to detect illegal crypto activity on our platform.” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What impact do you think this will have on Binance and its&amp;#39; Binance Coin&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-binance-dirtymoney/\"&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
