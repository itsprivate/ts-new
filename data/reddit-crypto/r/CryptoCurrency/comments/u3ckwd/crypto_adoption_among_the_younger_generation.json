I was really surprised to see that so I asked them about it after class and I was shocked by their knowledge. I assumed they&amp;#39;d all love SHIB or whatever coin Jake Paul is shilling now but they knew about shitcoins, staking and different exchanges. Obviously they&amp;#39;re all too young to invest at the moment but they said they were always trying to convince their parents to do so on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, it gave me a lot of faith that crypto knowledge and adoption among the younger generation is much higher than I previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bullish on Gen Z/Alpha/Whatever they&amp;#39;re going by these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
