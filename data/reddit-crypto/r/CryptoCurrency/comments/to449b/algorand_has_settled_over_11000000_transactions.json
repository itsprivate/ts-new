For more background on State Proofs, please see an overview &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/algorand/algorand-state-proofs-707d64038e35\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Developers are now able to build complex dapps for the Algorand ecosystem with smart contract-to-contract calling and network participants can take their first step towards trustless cross-chain interoperability with quantum-secure keys for the upcoming State Proof technology. These network upgrades come on the heels of a $20 million incentive program from the Algorand Foundation focused on developer tooling and&lt;a href=\"https://algorand.foundation/news/10-million-evm-compatibility-grant\"&gt; EVM compatibility&lt;/a&gt;, putting Algorand at the forefront of blockchain interoperability and post-quantum security while providing features for even more advanced decentralized applications. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These features add to Algorand’s already advanced tech, high performance and robust developer resources. Smart contracts on Algorand can be written in Python or Reach, making it accessible for developers of all skillsets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Algorand has experienced zero downtime since launch, helping it become the blockchain of choice for hundreds of organizations launching DeFi protocols, NFTs, payment solutions, regulated digital assets, and more. The network supports applications that can scale to billions of participants, all on a high-speed, carbon-negative, secure and stable blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
