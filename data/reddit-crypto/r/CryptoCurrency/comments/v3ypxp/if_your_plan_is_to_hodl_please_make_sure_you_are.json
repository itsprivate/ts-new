A lot of people follow the HODL strat and “I’m never gonna sell it’ll go back up again” mentality. It makes sense, it’s a good strategy but please be aware of what can happen.\nLet me give you an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The 2017 Incident&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine you bought around the ATH in 2017. 10-16.000$ back then. After 2017 a bear market hit. And it was a brutal one for the mentality of a lot of investors. -80% investment &lt;em&gt;on BITCOIN&lt;/em&gt; not just alts. And this wasn’t happening in a couple months it happened over years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast foreword it’s 2019 and BTC is currently at 9k again. You hope for a new ATH to cut your losses or at least break even and what happens? It goes back down again. It’s 2020 and BTC is still at 9000$. &lt;strong&gt;It’s been nearly 3 years now&lt;/strong&gt; since you bought BTC and your portfolio was always in a loss. And now Covid happens. BTC falls towards 5000$. All that with the years of mentality “Will it ever hit 10-16k again?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you managed to even hold through that time after 4 years you finally get rewarded. The next big bullrun hits and it was the biggest that ever happen. In a matter of weeks BTC doubles. After that it doubles every couple weeks. New all time highs every week reaching up to 60k+&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you managed to HODL through those years congratulations you just 6-8x your initial investment. I’ve been through this time and I can promise you the majority of people with that HODL mentality gave up and sold eventually. It’s rough and not as easy as a lot of people think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
