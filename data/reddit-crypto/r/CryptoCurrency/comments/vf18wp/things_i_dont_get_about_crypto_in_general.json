  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 - People say that crypto is a way to stay away from banks/government and protect your wealth, however what we are seeing right now are exchanges preventing people from making withdrawals. I understand that you can use a cold storage to protect your crypto, just as you can use paper cash to protect your cash. But at some point you will need to make a transfer and use an exchange or a bank and your crypto or money can be locked out. What is the difference then?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 - People say that CBDCs will give more power to governemnts. In most countries if you get your social security or similar blocked by the governemnt you can&amp;#39;t do anything in the financial system, so I believe governments already have all the power they need to block your financial life. And I would rather put my money on a CBDC than on a project such as Terraluna or similar. What&amp;#39;s the advantage of crypto or stablecoins here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 - Transactions fees are enourmous for Bitcoin and Etherium, sometimes even more expensive than using a traditional bank. Fintechs can offer international transfers, regardless of the amount being transferred for a flat fee. What&amp;#39;s the advantage of crypto in this regard?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 - Store of value. Nothing with the extreme volatily of Bitcoin, Etherium, etc can be considered a good store of value. A store of value implies low volatility and an asset that at least keep up with inflation. I often see people comparing the rise of Bitcoin price vs the loss of value of the US dollar and other currencies. This is a fallacy. Bitcoin gained value since its invention but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that if you bought it a month ago as a store of value it did its job. Crypto in general are looking more like shares than a store of value. It goes up and it goes down, to make money you either time it right or hold it for decades. What am I missing here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 - Exchanges get hacked or go bust and there is no one to turn to to have your crypto back. With banks the government guarantees up to a certain amount of your cash if the bank goes under.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very sincere with my questions and I really would like to hear good and adult counter arguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
