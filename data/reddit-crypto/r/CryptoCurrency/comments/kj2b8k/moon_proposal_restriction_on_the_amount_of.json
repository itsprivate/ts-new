I believe restricting the amount of comments a user can have eligible for moons (18 a day / 504 a month) will hopefully inspire more effort to be made when commenting.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s likely this small tweak will only apply to a tiny proportion of the community, however I believe it will make moon distribution fairer and more accessible for people that only comment insightful points.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m interested to hear what you think about this proposal, is the threshold too high? too low? When you vote perhaps comment a reason.</p>\n\n<p>Please note, after you hit the 504 comments (including deleted ones) per month threshold you will still be able to comment, but the subsequent karma will not be counted for the moon distribution. 504 was chosen as it&#39;s 18 comments per day in the 28 day moon cycle.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/kj2b8k\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
