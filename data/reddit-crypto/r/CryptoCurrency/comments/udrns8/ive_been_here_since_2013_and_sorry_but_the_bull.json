The stock market will continue to struggle while investors will look for alternative investments. Since crypto is extremely undervalued, it will decouple from the stock market soon which will create a positive feedback loop, where the more investors move from stocks to crypto, the better crypto performs, which will result in more investors turning to crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people who think crypto winter already started have already sold or wouldn&amp;#39;t have sold anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore the rest of the year is going to get exciting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just my 2 Satoshis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
