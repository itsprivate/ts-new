If we sell of course.\nIt is really hard not to panic. And even harder to see your 10k worth 2k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish we all have strength to hold and wisdom to buy instead of panic selling because this is the correct time to buy and not at peak hype of 2021.\nAnd those of us who hold through this will get rewarded. And if you came out of this mess with a nice profit, when someone talks about how lucky you were, you owe it to yourself to tell them to go F themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a great day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
