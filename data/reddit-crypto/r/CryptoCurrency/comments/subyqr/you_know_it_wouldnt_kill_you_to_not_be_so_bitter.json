Just be a guiding hand to the newbies or can it with the harsh salty comments and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make this platform a better space and to push people forward you need to be able to see to remove yourself from your own perspective and see it from another&amp;#39;s eyes, less bias, less cult like mentality towards your favorite coins, and it&amp;#39;ll be smoother for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through support we can build a better community and some newbies here may go on to form their own startups and build the next big thing in crypto, what comes to mind when I think about supporting the community are launchpads like solanaprime that a providing a good platform for startups and support in their ventures for a change. Let&amp;#39;s just be supportive and see how that plays out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can see you&amp;#39;re trying to moon farm by making OP fall on their face, that&amp;#39;s really pathetic. Be the bigger person, help them help you. That&amp;#39;s my 2 cents on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
