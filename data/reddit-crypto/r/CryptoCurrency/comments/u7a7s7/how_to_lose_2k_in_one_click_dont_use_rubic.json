  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I got caught up in the Sphere hype and exchanged 4 ETH worth about $12K for Sphere using Rubic Exchange. This was a mistake and for more reasons than just not buying the dip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x7s83mffoiu81.png?width=342&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2852345854ba278ab4962d77c543f491e6c9f042\"&gt;MetaMask Transaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what exactly happened but $2K just vanished at the exchange. Looking at the &lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x90d233582efd622794459f84c3747b3ac41f7b295c98115946454e6c43d8282f\"&gt;transactions&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like Rubic swapped my 4 ETH for 10,257 DAI which makes no sense, but that&amp;#39;s what they did. By the time it got to the end of the transaction the math which should have looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(4 ETH * $3021.76) - $27.11 ETH Gas - $.15 MATIC Fee = $12,044.93&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;instead looked like this&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(4 ETH * $3021.76) - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RUBIC does some shady shit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; = $10,205.55&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/okyxz4o6oiu81.png?width=1375&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5d5f6b227cc61502dafe344b2b211a16d254282d\"&gt;Etherscan details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have since been chatting with them. It&amp;#39;s been 5 days. At one point they said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve received an update that the remaining balance (2k$) has to be saved on your account.&amp;quot; But never specified which account and then backtracked when it never showed up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/onhxwei9oiu81.png?width=375&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8d197c72b6ebded2480cda592c9ba4e600e54ca9\"&gt;Confirmation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9 times over the course of 5 days I&amp;#39;ve been told it&amp;#39;s being sent to their developers, but no one has coughed up the missing $2K&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even deleted messages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1qdjerm2oiu81.png?width=366&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=110c55791afd0b976dd4f27bb7cfe16c006e6c17\"&gt;Deleted message&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talk about shady. Not sure if this is a straight up scam or their tech is just bad, but STAY AWAY FROM RUBIC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I sent 4 ETH ($12K) to Rubic to buy Sphere and they stole/lost $2K of it and have been giving me the run around ever since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: For the record, I didn&amp;#39;t just go off and try some new service without testing it first. The day before I bought $1K of Sphere just to make sure the whole thing worked and it went through just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: I just looked at Sphere again and now it seems the default exchange is no longer through RUBIC. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
