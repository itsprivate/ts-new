  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think I found that group randomly on Instagram where they have just a couple of followers but when I checked their Telegram, I was quite shocked to see 150k members there. As I try to experience all the possible things you can do in the crypto space, I naturally joined to see how that process work. Here is a short summary of the annoying journey. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>When?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The group doesn&#39;t allow any comments besides their own announcements. These announcements have a very simple order. They tell you when will the next pump happen and then they send several reminders as you&#39;re getting closer to the pump day. I think that they do these pumps around 2-3 times per week or something like every three days.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a set time for when the pump starts. On the exact time and day it was planned, the announcement will display a simple message that just states the specific token&#39;s symbol. That seems to always happen at 6pm UK time and at the very second this happens, the price skyrockets. That only lasts for about a minute. For another minute the price hovers around the same high price and then it starts to drop hard basically to the pre-pump price. The owners of the group state something like that they &quot;hold the pump for two minutes to attract outside investors&quot;, but I think that&#39;s just a clever statement how to screw over a lot of people. I will come back to this in the conclusion below.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So all of this happens at Hotbit exchange which I&#39;ve never used before and it just look so bad. I&#39;m sure there is a very good (shady) reason why the pump group uses this exchange but I don&#39;t know the details so feel free to expand on this!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>My own experience</strong></p>\n\n<p>I prepared around 28 USDT and sent it to Hotbit (I did that by swapping it around with XLM to save on gas fees). I had the Exchange tab at Hotbit ready and Telegram opened on my phone, waiting for the &quot;signal&quot;. As soon as the token symbol was revealed, I typed it to the search tab and tried to swap all my USDT as the price was immediately climbing high too fast. The price per token before the pump was $0.0038. My trade went through 19 seconds after the pump started when the price already grew 1000% to $0.039! I didn&#39;t really know what to do because the interface of Hotbit is so bad but I knew if I will hold longer than another few seconds, I will be screwed. I quickly sold everything at $0.051 (highest point of the pump was $0.06) making around $10 profit.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sounds good? Actually not at all! It only took few seconds for the price to reach the top which means if your trade goes through just a little bit late, you will buy at the top and watch your money lose 10x of its value in the next minute. Obviously there must be a shit ton of people who already know which coin will be pumped and all the small flies like me only help them to pump it more. I think that the statement about &quot;attracting outside investors&quot; is just bs because the price wouldn&#39;t drop back to the original value if there were more people outside of the group buying.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to play around and risk with your money, this is a fun thing to try out but remember you can easily end up with $100 worth of shitcoin after putting in $1000. You will definitely never be able to buy fast enough to get those 1100% profits so don&#39;t let that blind you. I was super lucky and got out with like 30% profit? I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just because I put in a small amount of USDT. Was that like 10k USDT, the trade might have been executed at the top and I would turn into a clown 🤡</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thank you and if there is any total shit out there that you want me to try out with my, now $38, I will be more than happy to try it out so you don&#39;t have to!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
