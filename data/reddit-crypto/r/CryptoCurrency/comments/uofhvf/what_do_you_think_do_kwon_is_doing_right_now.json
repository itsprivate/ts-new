He&amp;#39;s still watching everything burn to the ground and has gone silent since tweeting yesterday about how he was in the process of fixing this whole mess. Circulating supply of luna has sky rocketed today going from 345 million to 210 billion as of writing this and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be slowing down at all. He talked a lot smack going into all of this so I truly wonder where his head is at right  now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also wonder if we will ever hear from him again. I personally hope that he pops up 3 months from now, pretends this never happened, then offers us a limited series NFT. I would also like to see him introduce a new stable coin called &amp;quot;SafeLuna&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know. I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly imagine where his head is at right now. What do you guy&amp;#39;s think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
