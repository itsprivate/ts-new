You can purchase cryptocurrencies from several popular exchanges/platforms such as Binance, Kraken and Coinbase. You can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there. You should note that there will often be a transaction or a &#39;gas fee&#39; when moving most crypto&#39;s off an exchange and into your wallet which depending on how much of a crypto you own might not make it worth it to move off an exchange.</p>\n\n<p>From there you should bet set, there tons of great past threads on this subreddit about crypto that will probably answer the majority of questions you have so always google them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
