Take a coin like Filecoin, 56,697,664 coins are in circulation out of 2,000,000,000. Yes, only 3% of the coin is in circulation yet somehow it&#39;s rank #20. Why are people even buying coins like this or Avalanche or basically any coin with such a low circulating supply? They claim its to &quot;keep the price stable and help the ecosystem grow&quot; but really given the massive inflation this will cause and the fact that most of the time its so devs can dump their coins/ they own a large chunk of the total supply, I don&#39;t see how you can make significant money in the long term. When those other tokens unlock, the price will dip so much as supply increases it&#39;s not worth it at all. I don&#39;t care what the coin even does if such little of the initial supply is released you can bet yourself in the long term you won&#39;t make much money as opposed to coins where more than 60-70% of the initial supply is released or so.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
