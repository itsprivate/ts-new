Now currently at $0.122 from it&amp;#39;s ath of $0.68, thats a fall of nearly 70%!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kadgk0cpelk81.png?width=891&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=15f4b2d6d0c637c624ea0a2c22859b6dea2952b7\"&gt;Consistent downtrend (1D chart)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been minor jumps and pumps along the way, but after every single jump, there&amp;#39;s a even bigger dump. The gap between pumps have been becoming higher and higher, and the duration of the pump has shown to be shortening over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it safe to say the era of not memecoins, but dogecoin in reference is over? I honestly don&amp;#39;t think Elon or anyone for that matter would be able to bring back the hype of dogecoin as it was back in May. I personally know many people who bought at the top and still hold for the &amp;quot;$1 dogecoin!&amp;quot; line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I although did hold through .07 and saw my investment hit the multi-thousands. I didn&amp;#39;t sell because of that line, my knowledge in cryptocurrency tokenomics has a huge role in my decision making. I&amp;#39;m still baffled that Dogecoin managed to pull off being in Top 3 cryptocurrencies, when you look at it now. That&amp;#39;s crazy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, just wanted to discuss my thoughts. What do you think? I don&amp;#39;t think doge will ever go back up aside from the little pumps it may have, definitely not close to where it was at it&amp;#39;s highest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
