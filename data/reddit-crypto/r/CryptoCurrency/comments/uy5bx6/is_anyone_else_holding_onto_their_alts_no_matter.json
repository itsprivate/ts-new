All the way up, and all the way back down. Hindsight is a bitch, but we all know that, and I&amp;#39;m sure we all learned lessons over this last year about taking profits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a stubborn individual, maybe to my demise, but I&amp;#39;m not selling. I&amp;#39;m willing to wait 5-10 years and give them a chance. I&amp;#39;m like Jordan Belfort in his &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not fucking leaving&amp;quot; speech, no matter how psychotic that may seem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, are you holding on, or did you drop your alts like a hot stone?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
