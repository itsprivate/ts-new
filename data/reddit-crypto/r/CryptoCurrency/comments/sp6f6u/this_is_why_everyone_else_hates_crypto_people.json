Every bullish comment gets upvoted, and every even so slightly bearish comment gets downvoted, thats the &lt;a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\"&gt;r/cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; way! People get told to buy when the coin is up, when its down, when it rug pull, before the update, after the update, after the news, if you&amp;#39;d listen to people here you&amp;#39;d always buy! Not only that, but you&amp;#39;d buy the shitcoins that get promoted over and over again. If you even dare suggesting that an altcoin in particular might not be of much value long term, you get the army of shitcoin bagholders to silence you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result, is people are scared to say what they think, they dont wanna go against the &lt;a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\"&gt;r/cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; party line.What makes things worst is the moon system, which litteraly provide rewards for participating in the echochamber. The more bullish the comment, the higher the upvote! This cycle fuels a machine which slowly makes all of us more and more delusional, until we inevitably fall into collective hysteria. Problem is when you leave this sub, you sometimes don&amp;#39;t realize you&amp;#39;re also leaving the dogma, and everyone else that wasnt exposed to it perceive your opinion as absurdly bullish, leaving them thinking that you&amp;#39;re either crazy or full of shit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dont have a solution to offer, I just wanted to point it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
