  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before Christmas last year, I researched collated a list of the ten most despised cryptos in this subreddit. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The current statistics and indivdual performance of the folio is shown below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting value: $1000&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current value: $686&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Profit/Loss: - 31%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0uovguqn9bd81.png?width=804&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=afba680e7cc72c7b0f972ec04c80fe4bc5291397\"&gt;Folio of Hate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original Post from one month ago:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I&amp;#39;ll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won&amp;#39;t let me create a post with that many coin names in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
