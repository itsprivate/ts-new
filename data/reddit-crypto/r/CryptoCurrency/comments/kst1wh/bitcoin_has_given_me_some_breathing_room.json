I’ve always worked full time but I dropped out of college so I have only ever worked entry level jobs.  I’m not blaming anyone or asking for sympathy it’s totally been my own fault between poor choices and being stumble-drunk for about 5 years straight, but one thing I did right was invest a few hundred dollars around the beginning of 2020 after researching the halving and I’m so glad I did.  For the first time in years I’ve got some actual room to breathe financially.  Don’t really know why I’m posting here but just wanted to speak my piece out into the ethos, thank you all and cheers to our bright futures!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
