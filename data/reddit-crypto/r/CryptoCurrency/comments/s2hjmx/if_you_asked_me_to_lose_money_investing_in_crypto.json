You&amp;#39;re almost certainly at the bottom at this point and you gotta get out before the price returns and you make your money back!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buy wallets for all the companies, even though you have coins with less value than the cost of the wallet. Gotta get that $50 off the exchanges after all!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DCA into projects but do it in that way where you DCA MORE when the market is going up and then kinda slack off of it when the markets are down with that &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ll wait and see mentality&amp;#39; because the E in DCA stands for emotion and you need to always include that when you are making financial investment plans!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
