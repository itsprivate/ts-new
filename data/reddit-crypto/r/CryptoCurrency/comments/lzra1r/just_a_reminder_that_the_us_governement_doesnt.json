It does nothing other then create inflation in the economy. The trick will be to figure out where the inflation will show up. Normal quantitative easing usually shows up in equities and expensive shit like art  and yachts because it’s sent to large banks and distributed to the already wealthy. This time the people get the cash... I think equities will still do fine but crypto is bound to pop up. It isn’t that anything is more valuable it’s that the dollar is worth less in terms of those assets.</p>\n\n<p>Full disclosure: I’m Canadian and will 100% be riding the financial asset inflation wave 🏄</p>\n\n<p>Edit: first post and I manage a spelling error in the title 🤦🏻‍♂️</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: My first award!
