(<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mc60c0/to_bitboy_crypto_and_related_youtube_clickbaiters/\">Link to that post</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I get constant recommendations in my Youtube of this clickbaity fuckers, even though I have selected &quot;Don&#39;t show anymore&quot; on Youtube, but I guess it doesn&#39;t care. And lucky me...because Bitboy has released a video titled: &quot;My $10 Million Crypto Portfolio REVEALED (Shocking Holdings)&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, there is nothing shocking in your holdings, besides the amount of coins that you have already accepted a sponsor of and didn&#39;t disclose it, which is illegal.</p>\n\n<p>And this got me thinking of some coins that he has proclaimed that have a &quot;100x&quot; potential, so I decided to watch the video, and see if he puts his money where is mouth is. (I only know where he puts his mouth in for those thumbnails)</p>\n\n<p>Well Lo and Behold...that must be one of the biggest self exposes I have seen in a while.</p>\n\n<p>He has SEVERAL videos titled something similar to: &quot;BEST Low Cap Crypto Gem of 2021&quot;, and GUESS WHAT!! He doesn&#39;t hold 2/10 coins that he pumps in those videos. But he does hold 300k USD...hmmm, where has that come from?</p>\n\n<p>I know that one of his sponsored videos was about SOUL, where he named it the BEST LOW CAP GEM, and HE DOESN&#39;T OWN IT. This is more than proof that he dumps soon after his video airs.</p>\n\n<p>Frontier...same thing...naming it the coin with the best potential he has seen, and it is only 0.4% of his portfolio??? Yeah right. See it for yourself if you are interested...</p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to leave this information here. THIS IS PROOF THAT WHOEVER LISTENS TO BITBOY CRYPTO IS BEING SCAMMED. And if he was investigated...oh boy...oh boy, he would certainly use that 😱😮 face quite a bit in jail.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
