Don&#39;t look to Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, and other popular figures as a source of guidance</strong></p>\n\n<p>These prominent figures need to be viewed with skepticism, as their pockets are deep, and they stand to reap great reward from the groupthink of little fishies like us.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mntcz3/elon_musk_is_not_one_of_us_stop_using_him_as_a/\">Elon Musk Is Not One Of Us. Stop Using Him As a Role Model.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lm891z/elon_should_not_be_held_up_as_a_positive_figure/\">Elon should not be held up as a positive figure for crypto. Crypto is for the people not a plaything for the richest man in the world.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lra6ps/im_honestly_not_buying_this_billionaire_bitcoin/\">I&#39;m honestly not buying this Billionaire - Bitcoin relationship anymore.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Robinhood and WeBull are NOT places to invest in crypto</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aside from the fact that Robinhood has done multiple shady things in the past like front-running order books and disabling buy/sell buttons, the primary reason to avoid these exchanges is because you don&#39;t actually own the crypto when using their services. The rule of thumb, <em>&quot;not your keys, not your coins.&quot;</em> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lfrslo/reminder_robinhood_blocked_several_stocks_from/\">Reminder: Robinhood blocked several stocks from being bought. They locked the buy button when it suited them. Don&#39;t buy Bitcoin on Robinhood. The dust has settled, but we remember.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l7x3bi/to_all_the_new_folks_getting_into_crypto_do_not_i/\">To all the new folks getting into crypto: Do not, I repeat, do not buy on Robinhood.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Be wary of Youtubers because they have their own motivations and are ultimately trying to pump their own bags</strong></p>\n\n<p>Youtube can be a great source of information, but it is very common for Youtubers to leverage their audience for their own personal benefit.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mekhv7/crypto_youtubers_tier_list/\">Crypto Youtubers Tier List</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mct868/proof_that_bitboy_crypto_pumps_and_dumps_on_his/\">Proof that Bitboy Crypto Pumps and Dumps on his subscribers. So yeah, once again, fuck you Bitboy Crypto and other Youtubers.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Don&#39;t dwell on past gains that you missed out on during previous Bull runs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hindsight is 20/20. We all wish we drank from the BTC faucets back in the day but it&#39;s not worth beating yourself up over. We are here now, let&#39;s make the best of it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lijzxr/if_i_had_bought_btc_in_the_early_2010s_at_10/\">&quot;If I had bought BTC in the early 2010&#39;s at 10 cents, I would be a millionaire now&quot;. Truth is: You would have sold long before BTC reached even its 2017 ATH of 20k USD.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mszcav/the_psychology_of_investing/\">The Psychology Of Investing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ma6uph/stop_dwelling_on_the_past_the_best_day_to_invest/\">Stop dwelling on the past: The best day to invest was yesterday. The next best is today.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. DeFi is the way of the future</strong></p>\n\n<p>The traditional centralized markets are comprised of middlemen and gatekeepers that all need a cut of the money going through transaction. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Decentralized Exchanges are removing the middlemen and revolutionizing the nature of financial transactions.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l6wv0u/wall_street_has_decided_youre_not_responsible/\">Wall Street has decided you&#39;re not responsible enough to buy GME.

There are many ways to earn FREE crypto daily</strong></p>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re rich or poor, you still have an entry to crypto investment with these ways to earn free crypto.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/llyq6e/a_collection_of_all_the_possible_ways_to_earn/\">A collection of all the possible ways to earn free Crypto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m983wv/investing_in_crypto_with_low_income_how_ive_been/\">Investing in Crypto with Low Income: How I&#39;ve been doing it</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lsvqeu/i_dont_care_if_you_invested_100_or_1m_youre_doing/\">I don&#39;t care if you invested $100 or $1M. You&#39;re doing something for your future and we should all respect that.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. People have opinions about Dogecoin</strong></p>\n\n<p>Heavily debated on this sub- the tokenomics of Dogecoin don&#39;t lend themselves to sustainable price increase in the long-term, but the laws of Supply vs. Demand are counteracting the tokenomics in this current Bull run. How long will it be sustained? No one has the answer.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mwwffa/people_that_say_imagine_if_dogecoin_went_to_10_or/\">People That Say &quot;Imagine If DogeCoin Went to $10 or $100&quot; Do You Guys Understand Market Cap and Circulating Supply?

That&#39;s around 14m coins per day.

There are a lot of Shitcoins and Scams now, maybe even more than before</strong></p>\n\n<p>As of the past few months, Shitcoins have been penetrating the mainstream ethos and serve as a significant risk to less-seasoned investors who might fall prey to scammers and rug pulls.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvujsi/doge_paved_way_to_a_lot_of_scam_coins_beware_of/\">Doge paved way to a lot of scam coins: Beware of SH*T coins like Safemoon, Elongate, safemars, safegalaxy, safe whatever.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mytvup/shtcoins_like_safemoon_are_creating_unrealistic/\">Sh*tcoins like Safemoon are creating unrealistic expectations in the Crypto world</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. Be careful about telling others you own crypto, or suggesting to them that they invest in crypto themselves.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The more insight people have into your net worth, the more susceptible you are to being targeted by someone with malicious intent. Divulging your holdings and recommending crypto to family and friends can introduced severe complications into your relationship.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n13oql/for_the_crying_out_loud_stop_telling_your_friends/\">For the crying out loud, stop telling your friends and family to invest in crypto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mtsq3g/i_told_my_friend_to_buy_btc_last_week_he_stopped/\">I told my friend to buy BTC last week.

Your health is the #1 priority</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are all heavily invested in crypto not just financially, but mentally and physically. It is hard to disconnect and stop watching green and red candles every waking moment. Being able to dedicate uninterrupted focus on personal relationships and other interests is highly liberating and a goal every member of this sub should prioritize.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mwl056/much_needed_mindfulness_during_this_dip/\">Much Needed Mindfulness During This Dip</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lsqzr7/stop_checking_your_portfolio_every_5_mins_get/\">Stop checking your Portfolio every 5 mins.
