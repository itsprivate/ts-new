It’s basically an offline blockchain rn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This used to be discussed on the Solana sub few times and used to be called out as FUD. The same shit is getting agreed now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to hear shit like decentralisation is not the only important aspect, network can be usable and also centralised and be successful. &lt;strong&gt;decentralisation IS important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bots are spamming w micro transactions because they’re basically free. The only way to fix this now is increasing the transaction fees to make it expensive for bots to spam. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sub is total havoc w people telling the transactions aren’t going through.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
