Though, I do also think that people may be apt to missing the overarching theme of the tweet. </p>\n\n<p><em>There&#39;s rhetoric to consider here. &quot;Rhetorical nuance&quot; if you will. It&#39;s like a football aficionado saying, &quot;Football is not a game. It has nothing to do with a ball. It&#39;s a way of life and freedom for the spirit.&quot; Of course that&#39;s not 100% perfectly accurate in technical terms, but it gives an idea as to what it can stand for and mean to some people, while also holding some more universal, philosophical truths.</em></p>\n\n<p>I really like this thinking and sort of statement. Obviously, CEO of Microstrategy, Mr. Saylor, sees a future wherein blockchain technology / distributed ledger technology is something like ubiquitous and authoritative. <em>I, too, share that vision - as I&#39;m sure many reading now do, too.</em>  Along with that, though, is a thinking outside of traditional and restrictive ideation. It&#39;s &quot;untraditional&quot; in so many words. Just because you&#39;ve/we&#39;ve/they&#39;ve done something like <em>that</em> for a thousand years doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t do something like <em>this</em> now.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;m surprised no one has noticed yet, but the quote in the title of the post <em>is not</em> in the article (c&#39;mon people, you need to be a little more vigilant; your life may depend on it god dammit) ... ... ... it <em>was.</em> I remember reading it and is the reason I initially posted it a couple of months back and wanted to post it again, because it really gives a good perspective and idea of what&#39;s possible with DLT. Nevertheless, I&#39;m now searching for it and not finding it anywhere. I haven&#39;t done a search of all his tweets, so imagine it is there somewhere, but maybe someone reading this now can link it for everyone if they find it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit2: <a href=\"https://blog.kraken.com/post/6725/watch-super-bull-michael-saylor-says-bitcoin-is-the-central-bank-of-cyberspace/\">Here&#39;s</a> something close from Kraken.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
