This hurts the whole cryptospace and any serious project as long as this is going on. Doing a rollback back to 3 or 4 days ago does not solve ANYTHING it just hurts even more. The legal implications of that would be gigantic, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am actually debating, if I should by some coins just to have funny legal battle if they actually follow through with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: If someone wants to dive deep into the mind of the self proclaimed &amp;quot;lunatics&amp;quot; here you go: &lt;a href=\"https://agora.terra.money/\"&gt;https://agora.terra.money/&lt;/a&gt; There are all kinds of really funny proposals :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
