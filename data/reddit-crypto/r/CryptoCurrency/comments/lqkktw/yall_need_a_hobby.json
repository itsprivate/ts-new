Find out what kind of free learning programs your library offers. </p>\n\n<p>I get that crypto is the future but a lot of other things are the future too. Like urban farming, global infrastructure, and decentralized learning. Don’t just diversify your money investments, think about your time the same way. Before you give yourself a stroke</p>\n\n<p>Edit: why am I getting awards? Spend that money on a pack of seeds, or a dollar bin record that you think might have cool samples on it, or a cheap thrift store electronic piano, or a fruit from the Asian store you haven’t tried before instead 🙏</p>\n\n<p>Also, some of y’all are looking real salty. I ain’t telling anyone to buy or sell or hodl or anything, do you. Just be healthy. If you stress a lot when you’re young, it’s gonna snowball when you get old. They have charts for that too. Do you wanna spend your moon money on healthcare or a party boat?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
