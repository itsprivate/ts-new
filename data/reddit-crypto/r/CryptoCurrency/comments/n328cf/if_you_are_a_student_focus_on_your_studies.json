Now I have a decent job. \nI can&#39;t help but think in which mindset are students who lately made some quick gains. If you did take some gains, I can only congratulate you, you probably did better than most of your student peers who are probably not fully aware of what crypto is.</p>\n\n<p>But be aware that once you make your first gains, there is something I call the &quot;casino effect&quot;. It pushes you to take more and more risks. I think it can be even amplified as a student because most of you don&#39;t have yet a monthly income. I remember that each penny counts and insane gains can start turning your head. At the same time, you are in the period of your life when you need to make very important decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Lately, you might read about young Samsung employees quitting their jobs in South Korea thanks to millions of $ they earned in crypto. Or read cool posts about huge gains and lambo.\nAnd you might think there is no good reason to study anymore.\nStrangely there is not much about people ashamed of massive losses.</p>\n\n<p>My message is for you to keep in mind you must measure your risk. Crypto is great but who knows when the rollercoaster ends or when you will make bad moves (we all do). You can not rely only on that. Hopefully the recent dip made you realize that. Please treat your study as your top priority and crypto as a bonus. If you make it in crypto, that would be amazing. If not, you still have a diploma and a good option in life.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crypto = great</li>\n<li>Crypto + job = better</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t gamble on your life. Don&#39;t have regrets. Decision is only yours.</p>\n\n<p>Your crypto older brother who wish you good in life.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
