Some person creates a shit coin and pays influencers to shill his coin in order to create a fake hype and boom, that coin is in top 20 without any use case and utility. Excuse me but what the fuck?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We almost lost our most important values, fundamentals, utility, a good dev team etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a market where shitcoins sit easily in top 20 without any utility/use case, no one cares about fundamentals anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
