I’m not sure what they mean by “exclusively curated NFT” launches (on what basis is it curated?) but given that other platforms have everyone and their mothers launching NFTs, I’m up for something that is a little more handpicked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of this package is the SMAK governance token which could go shoot up if the launchpad does well. I’m getting some just in case, because screw it, I’ve missed out on too much&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I’m also growing open to the fact that newer NFT platforms might do better. Don’t get me wrong, OpenSea and the rest will still have a strong market presence but I think we’ll see some outflow as newer gen launchpads come up with better features and checks, kinda like how solana, fantom, bsc took some influence away from ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
