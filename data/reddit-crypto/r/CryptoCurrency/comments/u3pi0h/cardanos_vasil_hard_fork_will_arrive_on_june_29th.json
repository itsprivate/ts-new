It enables even greater gains in headroom, which will enable further increases to Cardano’s performance and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pipelining is just one of the pillars supporting Cardano’s scaling this year. Combined, all these changes will lead Cardano to a position where it is faster than its competitors, and a highly competitive platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Expect June to be a month of innovation and change for the Cardano ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
