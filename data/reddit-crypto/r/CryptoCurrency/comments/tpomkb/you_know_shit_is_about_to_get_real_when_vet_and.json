Before that always BTC went up and we thought the rally is about to start. But this time we got the real indicators going up. The famous ADA and VET stablecoins are on the rise!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean seriously what was the last time we saw ADA making double digit gains nearly everyday and goddamn VET pump 30% in one day. Other Cryptos pump double digits nearly every second week or so. That&amp;#39;s nothing special and does not mean anything at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if we are all lucky we may be going on such a MASSIVE rally that ADA would be capable of regaining its stablecoin status at 1.20$ and VET its stable coin status at 0.11$. Buckle up everyone we are in for a helluva crazy ride.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
