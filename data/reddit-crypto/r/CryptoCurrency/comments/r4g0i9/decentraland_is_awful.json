It&#39;s only the popular buy because it was one of the only metaverses you could even invest in for a long time, but no way will this game stand the test of time.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I&#39;ll be eating my words someday, for anyone with big bags of Mana I hope it continues to do well and truly improve, but I had to sell mine. Moved it into Enjin and Gala, broader metaverse plays that don&#39;t depend on the success of just one project. But then again for all I know this is a Fortnite-before-Battle-Royale situation 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>\n\n<p>All I know is that as a gamer, tech enthusiast, and someone with a job, there&#39;s no way I would ever waste my time in Decentraland as it stands now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
