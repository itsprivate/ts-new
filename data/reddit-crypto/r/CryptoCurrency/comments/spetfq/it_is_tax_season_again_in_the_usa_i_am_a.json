I&amp;#39;ve been in the cryptocurrency space as an investor since 2013, so I&amp;#39;ve seen much the development of the cryptocurrency community, regulations, and use-cases first-hand. As a practicing attorney I consider it a privilege to have successfully shifted my hobby into a career in such an excitng, cutting-edge field of law. Now that tax season is in full swing again, I wanted to drop in and host another AMA as Americans start the process of untangling their 2021 cryptocurrency activity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I&amp;#39;ll try to respond to as many questions as possible, including in the coming days/weeks, so if you&amp;#39;re late to the party please feel free to drop your comment/question and I&amp;#39;ll circle back to provide answers when I have the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This AMA is not the place to get specific legal, tax, or investment advice. Everyone&amp;#39;s tax situation is different, so you should always consult with your own tax professional before acting on anything you read online. What makes sense for one person&amp;#39;s situation might not make sense for you. For this reason, this AMA is for general informational purposes only and does not create any professional attorney-client relatioships. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;m going to leave this post up for a couple hours and circle back once questions begin rolling in-- So please don&amp;#39;t be discouraged if I don&amp;#39;t address to your questions immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
