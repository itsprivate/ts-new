This post is for those of you that do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is staking? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Staking is a mechanic where you lock up your cryptos and generate passive income as you are helping to secure the blockchain through said mechanic. So you don&amp;#39;t have to do anything and you can generate passive income through staking. This is just like interest in banks but only with much better APY. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say I have 32 ETH and I am staking them for a 6% APY. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So 32 ETH x 6% = 1.92 ETH&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gives you 1.92 ETH for free by staking every year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many coins that let you stake. BTC doesn&amp;#39;t let you stake but you can lend it out to generate some passive income. Generally, the APY for staking is around 5% give or take. Some provide more some provide less. If you are HODLing anyway, why not let your crypto make you more crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
