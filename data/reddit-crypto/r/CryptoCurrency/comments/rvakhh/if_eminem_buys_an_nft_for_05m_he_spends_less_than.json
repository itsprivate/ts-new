At face value, those numbers might look great ($0.5m which will appreciate with time)- but when you dig a little down- these guys are just playing with their lying around money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not get motivated by these purchases, they can afford to lose 0.20% of their net worth and still live the life that they are living. While most of us- if the purchase goes south- won&amp;#39;t be able to survive through the episode unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adding to that, most of these projects would fail eventually. Terrapin (a LUNA NFT collection) was minted for 3Luna each. The floor price of them today is 0.5 LUNA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so (let this post be a reminder) only invest what you can afford to lose. Only buy NFTs if you can afford to buy a minimum of 10 of them. As it&amp;#39;s currently a game of fire, and if you&amp;#39;re not cautious you too will burn your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
