The focus was still on using it as a currency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one I found interesting is &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/2a1y8f/the_death_of_dogecoin/\"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/2a1y8f/the_death_of_dogecoin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/auk515f8kwv81.png?width=1100&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5bf6c8dc9938a610fd61fd22740a5d43ab232507\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/auk515f8kwv81.png?width=1100&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5bf6c8dc9938a610fd61fd22740a5d43ab232507&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, people 8 years ago was facing the same problems as we are today in the SEC is highly unclear and how people weren&amp;#39;t sure what to invest in because the USA dragged it&amp;#39;s feet when dealing with crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015&lt;/strong&gt; it seems like most were asking if a coin is dead, they were talking about how hard it is to invest thanks due to banks, and other things&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that year I found this to be interesting &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3gtg5g/whats_the_most_interesting_altcoin_youve_ever/\"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3gtg5g/whats_the_most_interesting_altcoin_youve_ever/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They asked what is the most interesting alt coin. Most of them I never heard of and they died a long time ago. But this is an interesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tny0c7gclwv81.png?width=1081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55e6682cc4d93c851e138057a4d406115510106c\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tny0c7gclwv81.png?width=1081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55e6682cc4d93c851e138057a4d406115510106c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7hma0mqelwv81.png?width=1146&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f144f2959647cadfb1662ca8943a9724c74ee343\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7hma0mqelwv81.png?width=1146&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f144f2959647cadfb1662ca8943a9724c74ee343&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something to note is we get some FUD 2014 and 2015 against Doge. Even comments saying &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hoi1k9x4mwv81.png?width=1064&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce713a9b19ccb102b60fc2653886843ddb158280\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hoi1k9x4mwv81.png?width=1064&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce713a9b19ccb102b60fc2653886843ddb158280&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even ETH is looked as a scam. But note this is people like today trying to figure out the good from bad in the tech.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zgy2frjimwv81.png?width=1117&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e23b91ea40d4771111797713d7c1f7714b492fc1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zgy2frjimwv81.png?width=1117&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e23b91ea40d4771111797713d7c1f7714b492fc1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016&lt;/strong&gt; has more people looking for alt coins, best coins to mine, how to get into mining, exchanges, and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, this is the year when people started wanting to do something with their coins or do something like mining to get coins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at some recommendation coins shows what we see now where people don&amp;#39;t know what they are talking about&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qz7gtmjinwv81.png?width=1153&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31aa8705adbb4ec24d9665424b9de8b605841233\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qz7gtmjinwv81.png?width=1153&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31aa8705adbb4ec24d9665424b9de8b605841233&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/346z4xhlnwv81.png?width=1137&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1b2e36d78f86fd4eea0d22fb08be688d38308c4a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/346z4xhlnwv81.png?width=1137&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1b2e36d78f86fd4eea0d22fb08be688d38308c4a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that same post people were seriously recommending things like Truck Coin. There was some that gave good advice, like what you see today &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/s1q56satnwv81.png?width=1072&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d9735a59f350b564a7324bdbeb3b7ad206c4f593\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/s1q56satnwv81.png?width=1072&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d9735a59f350b564a7324bdbeb3b7ad206c4f593&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is almost no word about Doge but there is a number of post about ETH. It looks like ETH is taken serious at this point. Same with Litecoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017&lt;/strong&gt; there was post about what coin will 10x in 2018, more ETH post, Doge, memes started to come up, people freaking out about dips, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ldo8vrnqowv81.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b0b9f8d50b6bce66d72002e3e548fea4162c5ffa\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ldo8vrnqowv81.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b0b9f8d50b6bce66d72002e3e548fea4162c5ffa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found that cute. that is like a 10am for me. I wonder what they would be like with the losses we have now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is Coinbase fud because Coinbase added a coin they didn&amp;#39;t like. And again people were talking about how the SEC isn&amp;#39;t being clear with their regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the post were like a 2021 where the price went everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018&lt;/strong&gt; Robinhood launches it&amp;#39;s crypto trading app, Bitconnect, and virtually nothing else showed up on the search. IDK I guess it was a dead year. The daily went from 14k to 2k comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019&lt;/strong&gt; this looks like another dead year since the daily was getting 3k comments, there was some fud on how BTC uses more electricity than most small countries (while overlooking BTC is worldwide and comparing it is stupid). There was some push for NANO. Some post about ETH, the Binance block against USA people, and that is about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020&lt;/strong&gt; another dead year. The daily was getting 1k comments some months. There was XRP FUD, hacks, the XRP SEC thing, and that is about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2021&lt;/strong&gt; the daily kicks back up with some days getting 35k comments. Anyone who was there would tell you it was price, meme, lambo, questions for those coming in, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
