And quiet honestly, I think a project like Polygon is more deserving of slot at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cardano has &lt;strong&gt;A LOT&lt;/strong&gt; of potential if only they improve their development timing. But for the current performance, I just think they’re very overhyped. That’s just my personal take though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
