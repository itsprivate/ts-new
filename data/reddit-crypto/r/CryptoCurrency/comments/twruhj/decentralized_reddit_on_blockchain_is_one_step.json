  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve written about this a few months ago when I found out that a developer Esteban Abaora is working on a fully blown decentralized Reddit. To put it short, it&amp;#39;s a decentralized Reddit alternative that will use public key based addressing and p2p subnetwork to operate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty crazy alright. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Esteban believes that this design would solve the problems of a serverless, adminless decentralized Reddit alternative. It would allow unlimited amounts of the so-called subplebbits (subreddits), users, posts, comments and votes. This is achieved by not caring about the order or availability of old data. It would allow users to post for free using an Reddit like interface. It would allow subplebbit owners to moderate spam semi-automatically using their own captcha service over peer-to-peer pubsub. It would allow for all features that make Reddit addictive: upvotes, replies, notifications, awards, and a chance to make the &amp;quot;front page&amp;quot;. All this without any fears of illegal content as it wont allow any media hosting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So technically, &lt;a href=\"https://plebbit.eth.limo/\"&gt;Plebbit&lt;/a&gt; client developers to serve an unlimited amount of users, without any server, legal, advertising or moderation infrastructure. PLEB is their native token which will be used for the Plebbit similar to the what reddit does with it&amp;#39;s community points if you will. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/plebbit/whitepaper/discussions/2\"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; has been constantly updated for a while with a lot of work and he seems really dedicated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took some info from their &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/@plebbit\"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
