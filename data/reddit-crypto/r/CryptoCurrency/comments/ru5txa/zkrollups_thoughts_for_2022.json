It doesn’t seem that many zkRollups have tokens yet … it seems to me that Loopring is one of the few.  Who else is looking at this area?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the rise of p2e gaming, and retail interest in this area, it makes sense that there may well be growth in these kind of scaling solutions at a more sustained rate.  No noobs are gonna shell out thousands for gas just to play an 8 bit style game masquerading as a dex … even Defi Kingdoms has a high price entry point (shelling out for heroes) which newbies to the space will shy away from, although of course Harmony’s tx fees are of course wayyyyy better than ETH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;zkSync looks interesting, as does zkSwap as a dex … anyone know much about Polygon Miden?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have got a bag of LRC as a starting point - shill me your favs and why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers and beers 🍻&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
