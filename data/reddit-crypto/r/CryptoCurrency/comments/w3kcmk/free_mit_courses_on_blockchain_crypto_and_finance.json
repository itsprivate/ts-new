I took a break from staring at the 1m charts a couple of months ago and decided to fill my free time with some of this curriculum. Amazingly, this resource exists for free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MIT OpenCourseWare is an open collection of material from thousands of MIT courses, covering the entire MIT curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No enrollment or registration. Freely browse and use OCW materials at your own pace. There&amp;#39;s no signup and no start or end dates. (this is nice for anyone who has a busy schedule and can&amp;#39;t commit to classes all at once, you can take them whenever you have some free time)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OCW includes a growing collection of free open textbooks, lectures, podcasts, interactive assessments, and assignments. It&amp;#39;s a pretty extensive library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy learning!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=blockchain\"&gt;https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=blockchain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Edit: For the Gary Gensler haters, there are a ton of other classes about a myriad of things not taught by him, lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
