In the loss column, <strong>NEM</strong> has finished in last place 11 of 42 months, or 26% of the time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Update –  Portfolio back to break even point, only 30% of cryptos in the green, ETH maintains healthy lead</h2>\n\n<p>So, the thrill is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oica5jG7FpU\">gone</a>: we’re right back where we started in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">January 2018</a>, minus about 11 bucks for our troubles. That four month streak of the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio being in the green?  History.  </p>\n\n<p>This is very familiar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio.  Over the three and a half years of the Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only four months of green.  And all of the green months came packed together in the first half of 2021.</p>\n\n<p>30% of the 2018 Top Ten are in positive territory: <strong>BTC,</strong> <strong>ETH,</strong> and <strong>ADA</strong>.  <strong>ETH</strong> (+192%) is ahead of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (+154%) by a good margin and is the best performing crypto of the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio.   <strong>ADA</strong> is in third place, up a healthy +100% so far.</p>\n\n<p>The initial $100 invested in <strong>ETH</strong> forty-two months ago is worth $293 today.</p>\n\n<p>Still at the bottom is <strong>Dash,</strong> down -86% since <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">the Experiment began.</a>  The initial $100 invested forty-two months ago is worth $13 today.  </p>\n\n<h2>Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1q3fujvaw6a71.jpg?width=793&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc85fe90a3a352203003022e21b808b9030c38a8\">Monthly total market cap since Jan 2018</a></p>\n\n<p>After surpassing $2.2T just <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40\">two months ago</a>, the total crypto market cap has lost nearly $1T, down to $1.38T, the same level it was in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-38\">February</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>As a sector, it’s not nearly as bleak:  overall crypto is up +139% since <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">January 2018</a>.  If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than both the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+-1%) and over double the return of the S&amp;P (+62%) over the same period of time.</p>\n\n<h2>Bitcoin dominance:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/odom45edw6a71.jpg?width=681&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29210a7e4ba8a705144b4ad72b8668a03e012315\">Le BitDom</a></p>\n\n<p>After five straight months of downward movement, <strong>BitDom</strong> reversed course this month.  Is this a sign that the crypto market has more or less bottomed out?  Hard to tell, although it’s clear that investors are diverting funds away from riskier altcoins back into the big daddy <strong>BTC.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For context, we still have a bit to go before setting a record <strong>BitDom</strong> low: the last altcoin cycle saw <strong>BTC</strong> dominance go down to a low of 33% back in the first month of the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">2018 Experiment</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: </h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zpr0qn6fw6a71.jpg?width=355&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b54fc1e1773e53854b6320127d579cab2dd8ae0\"> 2018 Top Ten ROI - back to break even</a></p>\n\n<p>The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost about -$275 in June.  Not quite as <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41\">bad</a> as last month’s -$292 drop, but close.  The 2018 Index Fund is basically back to break even point, down about -$11.  </p>\n\n<p>If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, <strong>the $1000 initial investment would return $989</strong>, down -1% from<a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\"> January 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c45tl6ziw6a71.jpg?width=904&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7e671d3ca82a38e9b8f2424a981683b3df16821\">2018 Top Ten ROI, month by month</a></p>\n\n<p>Being down -1% after 3.5 years is definitely disappointing, but for context it is nowhere near the absolute bottom: in January 2019 the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/\">-88%</a> followed closely by the -87% Zombie Apocalypse month (<a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27/\">March 2020</a>) just over a year ago. </p>\n\n<p>For those just entering crypto, this is a gut check: can you stomach being down -1%?  What about down -88% on your investment after one year and -87% after two years?  When crypto veterans stress that you shouldn’t be investing what you can’t afford to lose, they mean it. </p>\n\n<h2>Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios</h2>\n\n<p>Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.</p>\n\n<p>But I didn’t stop the party in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the <strong><em>2019</em></strong>, <strong><em>2020,</em></strong> and <strong><em>2021</em></strong> Top Ten Cryptos as well.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-42\">2018 Top Ten Experiment</a>: down -1% (total value $989)</li>\n<li>2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +341% (total value $4,414)</li>\n<li>2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +469% (total value $5,688)</li>\n<li>2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +184% (total value $2,840)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom <em>bottom</em> line: </p>\n\n<p><strong>After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,</strong> the combined portfolios are worth <strong>$13,931</strong> ($989 + $4,414 + $5,688 + $2,840).</p>\n\n<p><strong>That’s up +248%</strong> on the combined portfolio.  Another massive drop from last month, but with a bit of perspective we can see that the combined portfolios are back to where they were a few months ago in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-38\">February</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y5vho1dxw6a71.jpg?width=380&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1a86a8c671c47c2cba975e44701d8a4481322de\"> Combined ROI of all four Top Ten Crypto Portfolios - back to February levels </a></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>That’s a +248% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<h2>Comparison to S&amp;P 500:</h2>\n\n<p>I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  Another solid month for the S&amp;P in June and yet another all time high.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v4zw0b01x6a71.jpg?width=568&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddc9ca4edf0a9391879cfd2e1779d3c22b6b6ea\"> Another month, another ATH for the S&amp;P </a></p>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 is up +62% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">January 1st, 2018</a> would be worth $1620 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  </p>\n\n<p>Compared to the -1% return of the 2018 Experiment, the S&amp;P is well ahead of the Top Ten Crypto Portfolio. </p>\n\n<p>But it’s not a very fair fight when I combine the four portfolios: taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments yields the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1620 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1720 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1340 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1150 today</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom <em>bottom</em> line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: </p>\n\n<p><strong>After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,830</strong> ($1,620 + $1,720 + $1,340 + $1,150)</p>\n\n<p>That is up <strong>+46%</strong> <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">since January 2018</a> compared to a <strong>+248%</strong> gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of over 200 percentage points <strong><em>in favor of crypto.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table summarizing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/61nzx1s3x6a71.jpg?width=501&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54e66accb8fa2766d5c91151dd0efaa2d63a3cd5\">Crypto still in the driver&#39;s seat</a></p>\n\n<p>Despite the less than stellar performance of crypto over the last couple of months, it is still far, far ahead of the S&amp;P over the same time period.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n<p>Two straight down months for crypto, something we haven’t seen lately.  The crypto crystal ball gazers seem divided on whether we have already hit the top of the bull cycle or only hitting some kind of mid bull cycle bumps.  Technical analysis in crypto is like reading tea leaves or entrails to divine the future: the guesses of the experts are as good as yours or mine.  </p>\n\n<p>To the long-time Experiment followers: thanks so much for reading and for supporting the project over the years.  </p>\n\n<p>For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow help you see what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and enjoy the ride!</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of January 1st, 2019, January 1st, 2020, and most recently, January 1st, 2021.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
