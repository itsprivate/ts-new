I went 25x into a certain coin and made an enormous 1.1$ profit. Now I can finally add professional leverage trader to my resume and apply for a job at some bug bank then go to a government organization, from there I will start my political career and in a few months be senator, after that I will make a crypto legal tender law as it should be and try do pass it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds good right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no joke had some amazing timing. Selling 3min before the dumb and making that profit. Oh leverage really is the safest thing ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t worry I will obviously remember you all after becoming president.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
