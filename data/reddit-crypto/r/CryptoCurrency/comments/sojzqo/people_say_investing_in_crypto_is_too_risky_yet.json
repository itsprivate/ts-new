With the divorce rate steadily increasing, a marriage is the most risky, unfavorable investment one could make in his/her entire life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, let’s say you and your significant other decides to divorce. Attorney fees, and divorce filings can well exceed $10k (If you’re lucky) and that’s not even taking into account your significant other taking half of your shit + child support if you have children. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Society is programmed into thinking getting married and having children is happiness. Don’t get me wrong, of course there’s happiness and love involved, but almost 65% of men and women find out the hard way there is A LOT of financial suffering involved too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, investing in Crypto is a risk, but so is living the blueprint model of happiness and success. Investing in crypto seems a lot safer than getting married to one person for the rest of your life. I’m just saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
