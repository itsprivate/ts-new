What I&#39;m talking about is actually using crypto. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Things like setting up your own wallet, sending crypto from one address to another, securing seed phrases, understanding Gas fees, those are the very bare minimum of actually using crypto (not even talking about using L2s, staking, actually using De-Fi, NFTs, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We take those for granted, but do you think the average Joe, who is too busy with his job and family have the time and energy to actually try and understand it? Do you think your grandma who doesn&#39;t even know how to turn on her Wi-Fi could know about it? Even us young adults are sometimes too lazy to study it. They probably won&#39;t bother and just use a normal bank. They would just go to a bank and proceed with their lives.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Crypto is about decentralization, but we may need to embrace more centralization if we want more adoption now. I hate it, but I think we&#39;ll need it. I think, Real adoption is when companies have seamlessly integrated crypto into their services. When users don&#39;t even know they&#39;re using crypto, they just do. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Like how reddit implements RCPs! We just open a vault to get it. Points are also really easy to send. Example only: Just tap my name and type 5 moons, hit send. It is so easy! Until companies make it *THAT* easy, we&#39;re nowhere near mainstream adoption. That&#39;s why I think we&#39;re still early. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Crypto is still too complicated for the general public. We need companies to integrate it in their services.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
