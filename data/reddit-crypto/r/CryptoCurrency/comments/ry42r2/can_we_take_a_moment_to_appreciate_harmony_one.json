It should be an external launch so onboarding externals for running vaults. Some minor details to take care of still, but the launch is still planned for this month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Trustless Ethereum bridge&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Expecting a month of work, but hoping to finish everything by the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Streaming sync and fast sync&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fixing last problem before launch on Testnet. No update currently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Cross Shard Transactions&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needs a few more rounds of iteration and feedback on designs. A few more weeks until start of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Polygon Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The team is working on this currently. More updates will come on this including date of launch in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Staking Derivatives&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently working on the consistency of the bots and this is taking longer than expected. Once this is stable, they will work on a technical plan for updates and final dates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;!!!Smart contract staking allows metamask users to stake!!! THATS HUGE&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Cross Chain API&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is as far as it can go before the bots and bridge are out. Once these are up and running, it should be a generic solution and finished shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Cosmos Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An external team is currently working on this. There should be a progress update sometime next week. The end goal is to launch in February.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Secure Resharding&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working with the Research DAO. Waiting on the write up adn finalizing design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1 second finality&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The feature is a major change so it is still under review. Increasing the gas fees slightly will help grow the block time and help with spam attacks as well, while still keeping the fees small for users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Decentralized RPC&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bringing in more partners to help with this. Should be done by the end of January. Currently working on new ways to continue becoming more decentralized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Decentralized Ops&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is used for onboarding teams to help with ops. Used to introduce a new Devnet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Ambassador DAO&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;goal for 2022 is 100 meetups per month around the world. The first meeting meeting will take place this month. Establishing a way to pay governors currently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, the recent crash did barely any damage to the coins price. Harmony is going strong and it is accumulating to the new ATH. When everyone is talking about ZK rollups on ETH, maybe more people should look in ONE and their immensely cheap gas fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
