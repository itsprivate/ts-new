And I think this approach will be proved superior in time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing how crowdloan works. When I read &lt;a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/web3-foundation-and-zondax-bring-ledger-apps-to-polkadot-parachains/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, I became even more excited because it seemed to be a fantastic opportunity to join in many projects. Polkadot continues to roll out of the parachains, giving people the opportunity to earn a ton of free tokens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;XCM will soon rollout allowing parachains to communicate with one another and secure token transfers between chains, among other things. On the existing parachains that have won a slot, projects are presently being built and launched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just some random thoughts and I believe there is much more to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
