The sub as a whole is wrong so many times per month, yet people keep making the same posts with the same confidence saying &amp;quot;This time BTC is done, the winter is here&amp;quot; ETC.\nHow many times are you gonna be wrong before you realize it&amp;#39;s impossible to predict where this wild ride is going?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
