These people called out Terra Luna while it was still on its upward meteoric rise. Basically they didn’t buy the hype. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they were smart enough to be skeptical then, and not just be skeptical but pinpoint the exact reason Terra Luna would self-destruct a few months into the future, it’s probably a good idea to follow them and see what they’re saying now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chances are they’ll be right again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
