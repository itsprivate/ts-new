It is a subscription service that costs $29.99/month and will waive all trading fees on the app(still could be effected by spread) and it will protect your account against unauthorized access up to $1,000,000 worth. It also says 24/7 customer phone support too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see myself using this since I hardly buy on the app and use cb pro for my crypto buys. Even with the 0.5% fee and spread fee I would need to be buying at least $6000 in non stablecoin crypto to make it worth the monthly subscription fee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The added protection is a good selling point though that makes me consider it since I mainly keep about $2000 in USDC on there to pay my bills with their coinbase card for the 4% cashback. Knowing that my card/funds are safe from unauthorized hacks is nice. I&amp;#39;m not one to be hacked though and haven&amp;#39;t had any issues with my CB account in the 4-5 years I have had it and the 9~ months I have had the card&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
