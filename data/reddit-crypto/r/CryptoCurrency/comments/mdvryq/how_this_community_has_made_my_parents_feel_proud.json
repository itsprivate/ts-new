I don&#39;t think there could be a bigger smile on my face.</p>\n\n<p>I told my mom about this and she couldn&#39;t believe it. That was more money than many brazilians make in a month, since the minimum wage here $191.27. My dad also was super happy for me.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am looking foward to sell my moons and buy a tablet with this money. This is something I wanted since mid-last year. Now I have it thanks to this community.</p>\n\n<p>All I have to say is big thank you to everyone here, to the moderators and to Reddit for making such a great opportunity to people from 3rd world countries 😀😁</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
