I have been in this space for over two years and learned about scams EARLY on, but just today I saw an advertised live chat between two well known crypto people and clicked it, saw 9k &amp;#39;other people&amp;#39; watching, was like wow, sent it to my friend but then thought, oh right, that channel logo was the wrong color, silly me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a novice. People are surprised when they hear about people falling for these but &lt;strong&gt;scams are getting more creative and realistic every passing month&lt;/strong&gt;! No one is immune. I search crypto topics and click websites and my MetaMask pops up like HELLLlloo! and I immediately exit out of the site; but imagine and UNDERSTAND that many people would just sign in without second thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YouTube Live crypto scams netted $8m+ in October 2021 alone. Scammers posing as Michael Saylor have stolen over $1m+ in Bitcoin via YouTube in one go. The value of scamming is increasing and YouTube is doing LITTLE to solve this issue. ChainAlysis says Indians visited crypto scam websites 9.6 million times in 2021. YouTube comments with WhatsApp and Telegram numbers left by scammers to call and obtain your property. Accounts made by bots to host only this junk. YOUTUBE IS DOING LITTLE ABOUT THIS. All articles are just about &amp;quot;raising awareness&amp;quot; but not about waht they are going to do to stop this from continuing.   Try and searching &amp;#39;YouTube&amp;#39; online to research this topic without getting just a list of their videos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/youtube-crypto-scams-on-the-rise-as-victims-lose-millions/\"&gt;There was an article two months ago,&lt;/a&gt; but it says NOTHING about YouTubes responsibility in this and I haven&amp;#39;t heard/found much since. There are ways the platform could be ramping up and stopping this type of crap but they take little to no responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
