This easy, everyone can do it. But then it starts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You notice other coins pumping, not yours. So you start to wonder, should I switch? If you switch your old coins will pump in front of your eyes. Then you see your portfolio dropped to nasty lows. After which it goes up. All in all you check your portfolio daily to experience the thrill of huge increases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investing suddenly is a lot more difficult. The long term perspective didn&amp;#39;t change. The emotional roller-coaster makes it hard. Your chasing new coins makes it hard. You make it hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of us will be best of, investing, waiting, and profiting. Patience. Eventually, your portfolio will pump too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
