It was &amp;quot;obviously manipulation&amp;quot;. The drop was gonna be a bear trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that the bear market may have bottomed, we are starting to see the exact same thing from bear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m seeing comments and posts about these latest rallies being fake, and probably manipulation. It will eventually crash to $10K. How it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, and how it&amp;#39;s a bull trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8mcmblcrbxf91.jpg?width=698&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf6fdf96517f970f39c156baa173046b405533f1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8mcmblcrbxf91.jpg?width=698&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf6fdf96517f970f39c156baa173046b405533f1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been well over a month since we were supposed to be in a bull trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We dropped all the way down to $17.6K on June 18, and haven&amp;#39;t found as new low since. And somehow managed to get as high as $24K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Bears have begun to switch their narratives:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more telling sign is that bears have started to switch their narrative. The main narrative of bears has been macro economics, and the plunge into a recession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The initial idea was that, if average Joe is struggling, he won&amp;#39;t be able to buy much crypto. That&amp;#39;s assuming average Joe really is the market mover in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inflation was increasing, gas prices went sky high, home prices too, it was tightening the budget of average Joe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only flaw remaining in their argument, was that unemployment was still low, in a year when wages increased the most in decades. So most average Joes still had money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But bears brushed that off and said mass layoffs and rising unemployment were coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now those increased unemployment numbers didn&amp;#39;t come. And unemployment is continuing to drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s worse is oil prices have plunged from $123 to $89. And the housing market is cooling off. While the supply chain is continuing its recovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Energy was the #1 culprit of the increased CPI numbers. In fact, if you removed energy from the last CPI data, it wouldn&amp;#39;t have had any increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole reason for Fed hikes has been CPI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lower CPI means the Fed won&amp;#39;t have to be aggressive with rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The switch:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;ve started to see bears switch their narratives that if the economy and all those things are starting to do better, that means we&amp;#39;re unlikely to see Fed printing any money to bailout a struggling market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we won&amp;#39;t see any bull market for crypto and will remain in a bear market. Based on the assumption that the stimulus is what caused the crypto bull market (if you check my past post on this, you will see that it&amp;#39;s not entirely true).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Economy going to shit was what they originally said would cause the bear market. But now some bears have started to switch to the economy going well being bearish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How we bottomed in the last bear market.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The evidence is growing, and the picture is looking increasingly less in favor of bear narratives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You only have to look at how we bottomed in the last bear market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8snms4ucaxf91.jpg?width=955&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=db61c37b9a3dde18a738c2899e4ffd793f9d8ea1\"&gt;2018 market bottom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g2p1f9xeaxf91.jpg?width=955&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f7919f7f233afc3f307b0afb1076c7ce3cd606f3\"&gt;2022 market bottom?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the timeline is shorter (probably because we also had a premature and shorter bull market), the magnitude, and most importantly the ratio is almost the same, with a similar over 40% drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had the same period of stagnation (crabbing), before crashing under the final support. Before crashing into limbo, but with a slowly growing uptrend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
