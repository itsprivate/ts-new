I’m not even in one of the worst ones. People can barely manage to survive in most cases. And people here talk about percentages of adoption? My god they need to get their heads out of their asses. I really wish you make loads of profits in crypto; then please allocate some of that to a trip to latin america and see how things are. We lose perspective behind a screen all day and it couldn’t be more obvious when you read some of the things here. Wishful thinking doesn’t even cut it, it is just pure dissociation from reality. Rant over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: Just wow. The entitlement of some people. I invite anyone to check the comments. You have two things: 1) actual Latin Americans saying “same bro” &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; 2) people from the USA/EU telling us we just don’t know about the actual place we live in. Astonishing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
