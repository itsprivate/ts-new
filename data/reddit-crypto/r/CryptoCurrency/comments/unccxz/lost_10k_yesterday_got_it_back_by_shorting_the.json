  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so angry/happy/upset/tired that I don&amp;#39;t even know why I&amp;#39;m writing this post. I just want to share it with someone and sadly I don&amp;#39;t know anyone involved in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When CRO sunk, I sold my $ 10k worth of CRO and bought LUNA. I was already at loss but somehow I saved 10k. Before they were 20k. CRO was 50% of my whole portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday my 10k became 2500$. I was shocked that 20k became 2.5k just because someone decided to make a mess. I have no problem with normal fluctuations, I invest in crypto since 2 years and I don&amp;#39;t panic when the market is not bullish. But man, cro and Luna did a mess because of their owners! It&amp;#39;s different! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never did margin trading. I always just bought and hold relevant projects. My initial and only investment was 400$ 2 years ago, I&amp;#39;m not rich and all my portfolio was built by holding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to take 1250$ and use it to short Luna. It was worth 25$. I went to sleep and this morning it was worth 15$. I was so happy for few seconds, then I realized that I got liquidated during the night so I actually lost all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up with my last 1250$.\nLuna was still falling. I decided to put everything and short it again. \nIt went down to 9$, I took profit and short it again by reinvesting everything (previous profit included). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It went down to 6$, I took profit and short it again everything I had. Now my liquidation price was 6.1$&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It went down to 4$. If I sold, I would take back almost everything I lost. I decided to wait, I suffered to much because of this mess and I deserved to get a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It went up to 5.5$. I started to panic. Just few cents and I would get liquidated. You&amp;#39;ll never believe me, but for few seconds it went up to 6.15$, I throw away my phone thinking I got liquidated, but for some mysterious reason it didn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked back my phone after 1 hour. LUNA was now worth 2.90$ and I realized I didn&amp;#39;t get liquidated! I closed my position and thanked the Gods of crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll never margin trade again, I&amp;#39;ll never invest in shady projects, I&amp;#39;ll keep investing in btc, ETH and few others like I always did before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
