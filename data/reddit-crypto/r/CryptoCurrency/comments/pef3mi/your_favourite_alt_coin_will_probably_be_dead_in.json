Yeah, most of them. <strong>Stratis</strong> is dead though, and <strong>NEM</strong> too. Some of them are in bad shape, like <strong>Dash</strong> and <strong>ETC</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>But now let&#39;s move to coins #10 to #20 :</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7jg67gtriik71.png?width=2422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d54db7adeeb60a423a9a0044c3448e632d80a5\">https://preview.redd.it/7jg67gtriik71.png?width=2422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d54db7adeeb60a423a9a0044c3448e632d80a5</a></p>\n\n<p>Now talk about an hecatomb. <strong>Bitconnect</strong> is dead, <strong>Bitshares</strong>, <strong>Veritaseum</strong>, <strong>Iconomi</strong>, <strong>Steem</strong> too. <strong>Qtum</strong> is down by a lot. Tether did well, but it&#39;s a stable coin, so maybe not comparable to the others.</p>\n\n<p>And the further you go, the less coins you&#39;ll recognise. Most of them are now dead. And coins like <strong>ADA</strong>, <strong>Sol</strong> or <strong>BNB</strong> were not even in the top100 back then.</p>\n\n<p>People were probably very enthusiastic about these coins, as you are about your favourite ALT right now. Many were bad, but the problem now is that we have a lot of good coins, and with so many good choices, it can be hard to predict what coin will succeed in the future.</p>\n\n<p>My clever grandma used to say, don&#39;t put all your eggs on the same basket 😀</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why my strategy is to chose 2/3 coins for every category (exchange, financial, NFT, etc, here is a good post about it : <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oomuyi/i_made_an_infographic_of_the_most_popular/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oomuyi/i_made_an_infographic_of_the_most_popular/</a> )</p>\n\n<p>I currently own 38 different coins, as I&#39;m probably not smart enough to guess which one will survive or die, and even if many of them die, I&#39;ll probably have one that will perform well enough to compensate for the losses, and be in the top10 in few years.</p>\n\n<p>So, diversifying is the key!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
