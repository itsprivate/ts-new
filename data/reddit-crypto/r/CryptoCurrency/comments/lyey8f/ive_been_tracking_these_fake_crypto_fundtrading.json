It all started when I found this account called &#39;&#39;BitHades&#39;&#39; claiming to do insane crypto giveaways. He claims to own about 1m Bitcoin (biggest bs ever) according to his bio; &#39;&#39;Worlds Greatest Trader - Humble Crypto Expert - I manage over 980,000 Bitcoin. I have 100% IQ and 100% success rate. Crypto + Stocks + Calls + Insider Info.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>It started to get interesting when I got contacted by a person that rather remains anonymous. He told me he got exit scammed by a crypto fund called &#39;&#39;Parrot Capital&quot; for thousands of dollars. The account that promoted and allegedly owned this fund was called &#39;&#39;CryptoWelson&#39;&#39;. The Twitter account apparently got &#39;&#39;hacked&#39;&#39; but I&#39;m 100% sure it&#39;s still controlled by this person.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bz8cmset78l61.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04ff0013d836e2c765a4fdf52a87d5a38530509e\">Conversation between Cryptowelson/Bithades and the person that got scammed.</a></p>\n\n<p>The account at that time was called &#39;&#39;Bithades&#39;&#39; but has been rebranded after staying locked for 6 months to &#39;&#39;RoryCapital&#39;&#39;. How do I know this? I had a chat with the account on Twitter when it still was called BitHades. This person/group built a huge network stirring their followers to certain Telegram groups where they can get &#39;&#39;1 on 1 crypto trading counseling&#39; or be part of an &#39;&#39;investment fund&#39;&#39;. Because these &#39;&#39;services&#39;&#39; are shilled by a large account it might appear legit, but avoid at all costs!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Twitter accounts associated with this scam:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rorycapital; 29.1k followers</li>\n<li>Cryptowhale; 79.1k followers</li>\n<li>Cryptomotus; 2.6k followers.</li>\n<li>FoxContest; 17.5k followers; inactive for 3 months.</li>\n<li>Cryptorandy; 0 followers, abandoned</li>\n<li>BitKrabs; 179 followers, abandoned</li>\n<li>Bithades; deleted and restarted, used to have 30K followers; 200 now.</li>\n<li>Randy the Raccoon; deleted account.</li>\n<li>Paxontrades; suspended</li>\n<li>Satosheye; Suspended</li>\n<li>Bitpivots; Suspended</li>\n<li>SinkTrader; used to have 20k followers; abandoned.</li>\n<li>Bitangler; suspended.</li>\n<li>Griffincharts; 1900 followers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>How do they get followers?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The person/group behind this scam all use very similar layouts and designs with bright colours and similar texts for their twitter accounts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qmtw7xxhe8l61.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f82d80152a4945417a70f1fad8fea745aa580eca\">Four of the main accounts that promoted this scam.</a></p>\n\n<p>These accounts start with giveaways of something ridiculous &#39;&#39; 0.1 BTC or 1 ETH &#39;&#39;for instance. They use the larger accounts (CryptoWhale) to retweet these tweets to get followers. After a while they rebrand the whole account into a trading account and start dragging people into &#39;&#39;exclusive&#39;&#39; Telegram groups.</p>\n\n<p>I will keep following this group/individual for the time being. I was told by the person who got scammed that they&#39;re trying to sue this group/person. Thanks for reading!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: some claim CryptoWhale has nothing to do with all this and is even followed by a well-known XRP shiller called Kevin Cage.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3zvo72b9z8l61.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b374b27b679117b6e2f13e6c7be9fd09c58d83a\">proof.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
