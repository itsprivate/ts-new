  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>First off, based on some allegations like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/muknjy/safemoon_developers_cashing_out_early/\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mumth2/safemoon_is_the_opposite_of_safe_please_dont_lose/\">this</a>, I made a post on <a href=\"/r/SafeMoon\">r/SafeMoon</a> for some clarity on this. My post was removed in a couple of minutes. I asked the mods for a reason and got no response. </p>\n\n<p>So naturally, I thought I might have broken a rule. I checked the rules and saw that there was <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/sGQF5nU.png\">one rule in particular</a> which stood out. Which loosely translated, IMO, means &quot;only say good stuff about this coin here&quot;. Red flag.</p>\n\n<p>That made sense as to why the subreddit is always getting posts from a lot of people glorifying it. </p>\n\n<p>Or were they actually people? <em>(cue Vsauce theme)</em></p>\n\n<p>I checked the newest posts for a while. I noticed a pattern in the usernames of the posts being made. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to direct your attention to these users:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Evening-Bluebird9402\">u/Evening-Bluebird9402</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Accurate_Repair1199\">u/Accurate_Repair1199</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Prestigious_Mix_1876\">u/Prestigious_Mix_1876</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Smooth-Currency-7774\">u/Smooth-Currency-7774</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Adventurous-Fact-354\">u/Adventurous-Fact-354</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/No-Minimum-2418\">u/No-Minimum-2418</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/ShallotAltruistic305\">u/ShallotAltruistic305</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Wonderful_Paper_7310\">u/Wonderful_Paper_7310</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Responsible-Push-539\">u/Responsible-Push-539</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Ok-Flight-2556\">u/Ok-Flight-2556</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Acrobatic_Trouble220\">u/Acrobatic_Trouble220</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/fab2606\">u/fab2606</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/micsel_0991\">u/micsel_0991</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/trading___123\">u/trading___123</a></p>\n\n<p>And many more. These are all accounts that have nothing but posts in the safemoon subreddit. The posts are either glorifying it or asking &quot;How to buy more&quot; questions. And here&#39;s the real kicker: All the accounts have been made on or around the 2 month mark. Right when Safemoon became a thing.</p>\n\n<p>Am I wrong about this? Possibly. But I urge you to check the new posts yourself. Every 3-4 posts or so, there is one post that meets the pattern. What does it all mean? Idk. Do I have money stored in this? Yes. Am I going to bail? No. Why the fuck not? Cause I willing to lose what I&#39;ve put in and I like hoping I&#39;m wrong.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
