Alot of people struggle with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more blaming outside parties, or us against them. Blocking out all criticism. Putting more and more faith into delusional utopian outcomes. Going into the whole &amp;quot;well at least we aren&amp;#39;t X project&amp;quot; and so, so much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one likes being made a fool of, and no one likes to admit they were ignorant in their choices. Yet it is something that needs to be done to wake up to the reality of the situation and make the decisions that need to be done. Dwelling on a dead or dying project is only going to hold you back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As stated numerous times on this subreddit. Everyone wants to be the $500 to $100k holder as that&amp;#39;s what everyone hears about. No one wants to be the $1000 to $0.01 holder, yet a majority of us will be and we will need to accept that when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is your call to make as you are the person who holds yourself back or pushes yourself forward. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
