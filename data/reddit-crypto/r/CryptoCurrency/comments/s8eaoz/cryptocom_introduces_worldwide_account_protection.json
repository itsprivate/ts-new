This is so vital considering how crypto is still held in suspicion by many.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To quote them:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto.com is introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP). WAPP offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com App and the Crypto.com Exchange.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user’s permission. WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms &amp;amp; conditions apply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some noteworthy things you must do to qualify for the WAPP:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available, &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not be using jailbroken devices, &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The WAPP will begin rolling out in select markets starting 1 February 2022. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CDC has also :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;migrated to a new 2FA infrastructure, with a longer term plan to migrate  to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Introduced an additional layer of security on 18 Jan to add a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new whitelisted withdrawal address, and first withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Full audit of the entire infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checks + threat intelligence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And of course, all affected customers have been fully reimbursed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the link to the report.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
