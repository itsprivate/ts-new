The first part is true, you can find the real addresses in &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t26b00/im_uvladimirputin_and_im_asking_you_to_donate/\"&gt;this very popular post&lt;/a&gt;. The address is fake though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately nobody fell for it yet, the last transfer to that address was 47 days ago, but please report the scammer to Reddit - I have done that already. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: just in case their account indeed gets suspended, their posts look like this: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Ukraine Update: Ukraine’s official Twitter account tweeted out a call for donations through bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoin tether on Saturday. I just sent what I could, wish I could do more . Have a. Heart Stand with Ukraine . Here’s the wallet address if you guys wanna donate anything to help. [Wallet address]&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see something like that, check if it&amp;#39;s the real address and if not, report the account&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
