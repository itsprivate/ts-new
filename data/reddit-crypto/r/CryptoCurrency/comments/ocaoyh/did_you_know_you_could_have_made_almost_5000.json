  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Retrospectively, the early days of moons were crazy. I wasn&#39;t around back then, but the moons-to-karma ration was really high, and there was no cap how much moons one could earn on a single post or in a single round. That means, a single post could earn you a ton of moons - which you could have sold for a ton of money if you held them for a few months!</p>\n\n<p>So I wondered: what&#39;s the most valuable post on this sub? I scraped the top 1,000 posts, added the karma ratios of each month (I use data by  <a href=\"/u/IHaventEvenGotADog\">u/IHaventEvenGotADog</a>) and considered the rules that were in place in each round. In the table below, you can see the top 10 posts, according to my calculations, got the most moons in the past, as well as the top post of every round that didn&#39;t make the top 10. As a cap of 1,000 karma per post was introduced in round 11, a lot of posts reached that threshold in every round since then, so I only include the maximum number of moons per post for these. I had to assume that all karma was collected in the same period the post was posted, so the real moon numbers will be sightly off.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">post</th>\n<th align=\"left\">user</th>\n<th align=\"left\">round</th>\n<th align=\"left\">karma</th>\n<th align=\"left\">moons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gk4u1z/ransomware_gang_demands_42m_or_it_releases_trumps/\">Ransomware Gang Demands $42M or it Releases Trump’s ‘Dirty Laundry’</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">TommyDyatlov</td>\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5,223</td>\n<td align=\"left\">46,359</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/h8s4qy/when_i_hear_my_friend_is_buying_shitcoins_again/\">When I hear my friend is buying shitcoins again.</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">MagoCryptoUnstoppable</td>\n<td align=\"left\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3,325</td>\n<td align=\"left\">44,564</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gzy5qm/someone_stole_a_bitcoin_atm_and_tried_to_get_the/\">Someone stole a Bitcoin ATM and tried to get the coins out.</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">slywalkersGold</td>\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">4,168</td>\n<td align=\"left\">36,995</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/htco2t/for_newcomers_bill_we_dont_forget/\">For newcomers: Bill, we don&#39;t forget...</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">alvarosb</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">4,373</td>\n<td align=\"left\">36,820</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/hbt863/when_you_show_your_friend_your_01_eth_portfolio/\">When you show your friend your 0.1 ETH portfolio</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">nanooverbtc</td>\n<td align=\"left\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">2,683</td>\n<td align=\"left\">35,960</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/iocof8/peter_schiffs_son_just_bought_even_more_bitcoin/\">Peter Schiff’s son just bought even more bitcoin</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">nanooverbtc</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5</td>\n<td align=\"left\">4,082</td>\n<td align=\"left\">34,664</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/huoceq/well_thats_one_way_of_putting_it/\">Well, that&#39;s one way of putting it</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">CoinwermStinky</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">4,042</td>\n<td align=\"left\">34,033</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gm0o0n/j_k_rowling_is_an_etherean/\">J.

The top post of all times, with more than 50k upvotes, got 238 moons for it, a post with 5k upvotes (which, of course, was harder to reach as the sub had less users), received 46k moons.</p>\n\n<p>So how much money are these top posts worth? Well, that depends on the moon price of course. While that peaked at almost $0.5, it did so for a very short time and due to the low moon volume it would have been impossible to sell a lot at that price. Let&#39;s consider $0.1 a realistic price, as moons were above that a few times and one could have sold moons over a couple of days at that price without crashing the price. Considering that, the #1 post on that list - which is just a link to an article, could have been worth <strong>$4636</strong> if that OP sold at that price. Not bad for posting a link!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
