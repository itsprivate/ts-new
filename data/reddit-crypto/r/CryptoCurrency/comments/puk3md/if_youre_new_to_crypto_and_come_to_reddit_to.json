Please beware.</p>\n\n<h1>1. This is official Binance/Kraken/Crypto.com helpdesk representative. You need help?</h1>\n\n<p>When I was new, I asked your usual questions like how to trade, what are the recommended wallets,  and how do I stake. </p>\n\n<p>Immediately after, I had these assholes send me grammatically painful private messages, giving generic advice and pretending to be from Binance or whatever. </p>\n\n<p>Since I don&#39;t have a wallet yet, they pushed me to open one on their website. It actually doesn&#39;t look like a scam site, but of course they&#39;re fake copies of legitimate wallets. </p>\n\n<p>Once you transfer money to this wallet, they&#39;ll rob you blind. </p>\n\n<h1>2. &quot;You need to connect your wallet to the dapps token interface&quot;</h1>\n\n<p>That&#39;s an actual message my friend received after asking a question on a reputable and rising 3-letter blockchain&#39;s subreddit. </p>\n\n<p>They tried to confuse her with big words like that, then gave instructions to &quot;help&quot; her sort everything out. Eventually, it just led to them asking for her seed phrase to &quot;troubleshoot&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t. </p>\n\n<h1>3. 💎 $SafeBabyRocketDoge 💎| Potential x1000!! 💰 / Doxxed team🔒 / CMC listing incoming 🚀 |  Get in before moon 🚀📈</h1>\n\n<p>Aka: the Rugpull.</p>\n\n<p>I got invited to so many of these moonshot posts with titles very similar to the one above. The scammers emphasize the &quot;hype&quot; generated by their post (&quot;It got 4000+ upvotes and 300+ comments!!&quot;) to convince me to buy in.</p>\n\n<p>Surprise, I found out that <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pqnd3s/i_did_a_little_digging_on_the_latest_shitcoin/\">all those upvotes and comments are from a network of shill accounts you can hire</a> to boost your visibility on Reddit. </p>\n\n<p>This fake hype is used to artificially drive the price upward. When it does, the founders dump all their coins which tanks the price. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone who wasn&#39;t in on the scam from the beginning would be left with a worthless dead coin. </p>\n\n<h1>4. Limited time event! Send our company 1 ETH and we&#39;ll send you 2 ETH back.</h1>\n\n<p>I saw this first on Twitter, but they&#39;ve expanded to Reddit DMs now. </p>\n\n<p>Spoiler alert: they won&#39;t send you ETH back. </p>\n\n<h1>5. My investments had an amazing month and want to share my blessings. Here&#39;s some free random coins!</h1>\n\n<p>This is either a dusting attack or they just wanted to steal my coins straight. </p>\n\n<p>How it works is, if you try to transfer, sell, or convert them you&#39;ll find that you need to visit a specific swap site and give permission for them to access your wallet. </p>\n\n<p>By access I mean steal the contents. Don&#39;t touch them. </p>\n\n<p>Vitalik is the only selfless angel in crypto and he&#39;s not in your DMs.</p>\n\n<h1>6. Search for [Wallet Name/Website Name] on Google</h1>\n\n<p>These asshats start by giving good and accurate info about crypto. I actually learned a lot from them. </p>\n\n<p>However, they tell me to Google the name of a real wallet or exchange to use instead of giving the actual site. </p>\n\n<p>This is because they bought an ad so that their copycat site shows up at the top of search results, above the actual legitimate wallet or website. If I downloaded the app or wallet on their site, then they would&#39;ve gotten access to my coins. </p>\n\n<p>Only download apps and wallets from official websites. </p>\n\n<h1>TLDR</h1>\n\n<p>There are multiple scams that thrive in Reddit. They specifically target newcomers who ask for crypto help or advice in comments/posts.</p>\n\n<p>DON&#39;T REPLY TO ANY PRIVATE MESSAGES ON REDDIT, unless you want to drag them along for a ride.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Edit - Here are other scams you should watch out for here on Reddit:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Gas Scam</strong> from SuccumbedToReddit</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Someone shares his seedphrase and reveals a wallet with several ERC20 tokens in it. You, being a bastard, try to move them to your own wallet but you need some gas. So you transfer some ETH to the wallet but the scammer set up a bot to snatch the ETH as soon as it lands. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Try My Strategy Scam</strong> from Optimal_Store</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get lots of DMs about these people who claim they’ve made thousands trading on [insert random unknown exchange] and that they’d like me to try their strategy lol</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Fake Youtube Livestream Scam</strong> from NorbeeNorbee</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scammers downloaded an ama stream with ADA creator, made a new legitimate thumbnail and started new stream right after the original ended, stating ADA event &quot;send atleast 1000ADA and well send you 2x back, only during the stream for a first xy people&quot; They add bots to the stream so it looks legitimate, so it has like 2k viewers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
