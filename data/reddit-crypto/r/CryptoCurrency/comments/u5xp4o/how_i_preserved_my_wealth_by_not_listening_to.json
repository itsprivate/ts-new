In it, OP claims that he &amp;quot;accumulated his wealth&amp;quot; by combing through the vast sea of microcap shitcoins on CoinGecko and picking winners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t listen to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, even if a project meets all 7 of his criteria, there&amp;#39;s still not a &amp;quot;good chance&amp;quot; that it will become valuable. There are tons of well-intentioned projects that go absolutely nowhere. And if we have anything like the bear market of 2018, then it&amp;#39;s probably going to zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, OP is lying about his success. Just 16 days ago, he made &lt;a href=\"https://www.unddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ttnetb/whats_going_on_with_move2earn_coins_how_do_you/\"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; asking how to find tokens before they pump:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I try to get in early, but it&amp;#39;s so hard to find these gems. Anyone have a technique? I&amp;#39;m baffled that people are making 100x on a regular basis. Here I&amp;#39;m crying in my 5% gain per year coins :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day I&amp;#39;ll get lucky too, but so far I&amp;#39;ve been hitting flat liners. One thing I heard is that people look into rank 1000-5000 market cap coins. But those seem so risky. What red flags are people looking at, and what are signs of healthy projects? I think doxxed teams are probably a good sign these days after all the scams. Anything else?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/YQtVQoI.jpg\"&gt;Screenshot from Google cache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;re to believe that by some magic, he went from having zero success to amassing wealth through shitcoins, all over the course of 16 days. Incredible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop upvoting this hopium, guys. Don&amp;#39;t invest into microcaps expecting to make any serious returns, especially with the market the way it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Props to &lt;a href=\"/u/Moronicon\"&gt;/u/Moronicon&lt;/a&gt; for finding the old post!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
