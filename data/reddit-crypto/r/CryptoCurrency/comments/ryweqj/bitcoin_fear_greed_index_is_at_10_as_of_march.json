  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin Fear &amp;amp; Greed Index is at 10 today. The lowest level since March 2020. At that time, the COVID-19 pandemic had just started to spread around the world, and we had a liquidity crisis in all liquid markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This caused the price of Bitcoin to drop by more than 50% in a few hours to a low of $3.2K on some trading platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fear was extreme. However, a strong rebound was quickly observed thanks to the HODLers of last resort who had seen a unique opportunity to seize. What happened next proved them right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, the price of Bitcoin is at $42K. This is almost 40% lower than the ATH of November 10, 2021, at $69K. But is it time to give in to extreme fear? I don&amp;#39;t think so. Above all, we must keep control of our emotions and take a step back. Don&amp;#39;t panic and take a step back. It&amp;#39;s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you doubt it, ask yourself this question: would you have been in extreme fear if someone had told you two years ago that the price of Bitcoin would have been $42K in January 2022? I don&amp;#39;t think so!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let short-term volatility override Bitcoin&amp;#39;s long-term goals. In a few years, the current period will not even appear on the Bitcoin price chart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay strong, Stay Bitcoin HODLers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
