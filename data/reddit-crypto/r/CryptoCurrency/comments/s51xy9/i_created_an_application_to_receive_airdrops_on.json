For users who enter the site to receive an airdrop, they don&amp;#39;t need anything more than to leave the public address of their Algorand wallet, which they can create for free by downloading the corresponding application on their smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I welcome all of you to visit the site, &lt;a href=\"https://algodrops.org\"&gt;algodrops.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\\&lt;/sup&gt;There are some limitations imposed by the Algorand network, not by me:) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;You must have a minimum amount of Algorand in your wallet to receive an Airdrop&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; &lt;sup&gt;You must opt-in to each asset before you can receive it for the first time.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
