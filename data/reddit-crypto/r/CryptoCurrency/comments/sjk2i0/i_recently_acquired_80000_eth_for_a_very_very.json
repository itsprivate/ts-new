It&amp;#39;s worth approximately 250 millions USD, which is not bad, if you ask me. Should I stake it all and get the 4% rewards? This way I would get passive income, something like 10 millions USD/year, which is theoritically enough for my family to live a comfortable life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, by staking, I would be contributing to the security of the blockchain, which is a big plus for me - I wanna do my part!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But is this the best course of action for me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also thought about getting into liquidity pools, &lt;strong&gt;but I am afraid of smart contract risks&lt;/strong&gt;. What if I put all my ETH into a LP on Solana, and then some asshole comes and drain the contract? I worked very hard for this ETH, that would suck. And there&amp;#39;s also the risk of impermanent loss - what if my ETH on Solana decoupled from the ETH on mainnet?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks everyone, and I look forward to read your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
