  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re in a bear market. Shit sucks. But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we can&amp;#39;t still have some fun right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For  those that were around at the beginning of the year, you might remember  that I created this. The FOLIO OF HATE. I invested (yolo&amp;#39;d?) $100 into this subs most hated coins. Some coins are hated because of utility,  some because of corruption, some because of the the shills. Whatever the reason, I decided to act on the theory that this sub can actually pick  winners by investing into the ones that we all hate the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, $100 was invested on the same day to each of the ten coins/tokens. Here is how it has fared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mll6gghpcue91.png?width=979&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1af27826e7183ea80040397286f7986ea196a335\"&gt;Folio of Hate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Down 60% or $600 in eight months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about the individual results? Surely they&amp;#39;re not all bad? Right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best performer:&lt;/strong&gt; USDT -0.06 %&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worst performer:&lt;/strong&gt; LRC -81.05 %&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise Performer:&lt;/strong&gt; BNB -46.23%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xjc4bfzucue91.png?width=945&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=386dc9f14842095519d45d27091836d26b5b77a5\"&gt; Folio of Hate Individual Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the savagery of the capitulation and bear market, there are some interesting observations.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal points of interest:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Binance is the best none-stablecoin performer. This could be connected to the collapse of other exchanges/lenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investing in Dogecoin - was a better investment than top guns Solana and Cardano.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Solana performed equally as bad as Safemoon &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tether - FUCKING TETHER - was the folios best performer. Props to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/entschida/\"&gt;u/entschida&lt;/a&gt; for getting that one right.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  am aware that perceptions and opinions shift over time, so it is of course possible that we hate these coins more than ever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the sentiment for crypto.com (or Cronos) has drastically shifted over the past eight months. If I were to create this folio today, CDC would definitely have a place in it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rng996/here_it_is_the_subs_most_despised_coins_combined/\"&gt;post for reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
