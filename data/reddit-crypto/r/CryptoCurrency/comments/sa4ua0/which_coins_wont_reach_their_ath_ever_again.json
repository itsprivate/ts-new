Now obviously to a certain degree that is true but just like 2017 I am almost certain some coins seen in the top 50 today will not be seen again reaching its previous ATH, probably forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key here is to invest in what you believe in rather than picking a few random coins in the top 50 and holding them without even knowing their utility. Because In a situation like now you are probably trying to break even at minimum and move on. This is completely the wrong idea. First off, always research your investments utility and if you picked some coins blindly based off social media for example, research what they do NOW, and I don’t mean reading the Coinbase info on the coin, properly understand the fundamentals. If you have a solid understanding of its function and believe it will be of use in the future then Hold. Or even invest more. If it simply does nothing of use I wouldn’t wait to break even, it is most likely the time to cut your losses and find promising useful coins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am interested to know which coins people here believe won’t reach their ATH again that are in the top 50.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bull markets make your rich but bear markets make you wealthy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: seems ICP and nano are quite popular, but does anyone believe some top 15 coins won’t be seen again tho and why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
