This could be for anything from a link to a news article, or a reposted meme. Now, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. People can upvote what they want, it&#39;s how reddit works. But for Moon distribution, I would like to propose that all posts are limited to 1000 karma.</p>\n\n<p>This would allow a more even distribution of Moons across the sub.</p>\n\n<p>It is also arguably a fairer distribution. Currently, one person may receive a disproportionately large amount of Moons for something as simple as sharing a CoinTelegraph article, while many others, who may be active members of the sub, offering helpful advice and support to others, will receive a fraction of the amount of Moons in comparison.</p>\n\n<p>1000 karma worth of Moons for posting a meme or sharing an article is still a huge amount in comparison to the amount you get for offering helpful advice in the comment section, so it&#39;s not like top posts won&#39;t be incentivized, it will just allow a fairer distribution.</p>\n\n<p>Limiting all posts to a maximum of 1000 karma would still enable popular posts to be rewarded generously, while allowing a greater share of the Moons to be distributed amongst other users.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/l25b1n\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
