  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I posted yesterday asking if it was possible to upgrade from a ruby card to a jade card on <a href=\"https://Crypto.com\">Crypto.com</a>.  I had several people respond with helpful information that gave me a little more confidence in the process. Here&#39;s what I learned and how the process went.</p>\n\n<p>I originally deposited enough for the ruby card, this was just to dip my toes in and make sure everything was legit. Yea I know that&#39;s a lot to &quot;test the waters&quot; with but I wasn&#39;t that worried.  After depositing enough fiat, I selected card option on the bottom of the menu and then selected the ruby card.  After a few prompts and check boxes I had staked CRO and access to the ruby card.</p>\n\n<p>After seeing how smooth the process was, and thinking on it a few days I decided to take the leap and get the Jade card, not only for the extra perks but also because I think crypto.com is going to be hanging around for a while and will only grow.</p>\n\n<p>So I began the process of depositing more fiat into my crypto.com account.  This is where I began to question if I needed the full amount (4k$ worth) of unstaked CRO, or if my initial stake could be rolled over and fill the difference.  After seeing the reply&#39;s about how it will/should allow the original staked CRO to roller over I decided on only depositing what I needed to meet the minimum CRO + what I had staked.</p>\n\n<p>The funds were available this morning. I clicked on:</p>\n\n<p>Accounts</p>\n\n<p>Crypto Wallet</p>\n\n<p>CRO coin (which took me to a page showing the CRO I had staked separate from any extra CRO I had)</p>\n\n<p>Under the CRO Stake option is an upgrade button.</p>\n\n<p>You select which upgrade you want (the jade card in this instance)</p>\n\n<p>It then takes you to a screen where it shows you how much more CRO you will need in order to upgrade.  So this answers one of my question, do I need fiat or CRO to upgrade. The answer is you need the CRO equivalent of the fiat needed to get to the next level card.</p>\n\n<p>So if you have 500$ worth of CRO, you need to buy 3500$ worth of CRO first and then go through the process of upgrading.</p>\n\n<p>After doing check boxes and agreements it said my card was in the process of upgrading and someone would contact me.  Several seconds later I received a message from in the Crypto.com app for confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s it. I know this may seem like an easy thing to do but I spent a few hours trying to google the process just to make sure I wasn&#39;t screwing anything up, so hopefully this will help someone else who was as confused as I was.</p>\n\n<p>A few notes:</p>\n\n<p>There is a 50$ reissuing fee if you want another card sent to you. This is taken from your fiat account on Crypto.com app.</p>\n\n<p>Shout out to the people who responded to my original post asking these questions!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Adding in some of the info from the comments below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;When you upgrade your staking to next card level <strong>YOU DO NOT</strong> have to order a new card   You still get the higher tier benefits, save yourself the €50, buy more CRO or treat yourself&quot; <a href=\"/u/HokkaidoNights\">u/HokkaidoNights</a></li>\n<li>&quot;You have to physically upgrade to Jade in order to get the airport lounge access&quot; <a href=\"/u/SineLinguist\">u/SineLinguist</a></li>\n<li>For each staking level you use the Fiat? Where does the money come from when you use the card. That staked fiat. Or am I wrong and it is the initial fiat amount converted to cro. <a href=\"/u/timburgessthis\">u/timburgessthis</a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Original fiat comes from you. For your original stake you only need fiat and they will stake it for you. To upgrade you have to buy the CRO and then use that to upgrade</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li> When you lock in for the card it shows in your wallet and has the interest rate and terms showing there. When you lock in for the Earn, it shows in the Earn account and only pays 6% regardless of if you have the Visa or not. You only get the 10-12% interest rate on the CRO you staked for the Visa.&quot; <a href=\"/u/tanukiparts\">u/tanukiparts</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
