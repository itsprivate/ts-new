We have reached this difficult decision due to recent market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We understand that this is disappointing news and understand its impact on you. We would like to reassure you that this difficult decision was taken for us to focus on stabilising our liquidity and preserving assets, while we work to find the best way to protect our users’ long-term interests. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience that this has caused you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would also like to inform our users that, as a result of the above reasons, we have since withdrawn our licence application with the MAS. Hodlnaut is therefore no longer providing regulated digital payment token (DPT) services, ie our token swap feature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are actively working on the recovery plan that we hope to provide updates and details on as soon as permissible. We are consulting with Damodara Ong LLC on the feasibility and timelines of our intended execution plan and are strategising our recovery plan with our users’ best interests in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
