What they can do is swapping a shitcoin for another shitcoin or staking to gain more shitcoins. How crypto market isn’t just a large online betting site when everything gain value from short time speculation and manipulation. When the price hasn&amp;#39;t really been correlated with the quality of the product. It&amp;#39;s just all the hype.
