The top 5 upvoted questions will also win a  Ucam!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My own question was actually the most upvoted. They never replied to me about sending a camera, but I figured maybe it was just because I was a mod. However, in the last few days we&#39;ve had two other people reach out by modmail and say that they were highly upvoted questions in that thread and have not heard anything from iotex people.</p>\n\n<p>So, we are giving them a day or so to respond here, then we will consider iotex people as either liars or scammers (maybe they don&#39;t even have cameras who the fuck knows), and as such we are going to ban their account, blacklist the word iotex, and leave this post up for a day or so to warn the users of this subreddit to avoid them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
