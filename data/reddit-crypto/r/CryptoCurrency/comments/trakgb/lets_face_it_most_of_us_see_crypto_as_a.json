But I would also say that at one point Crypto will be so big that it would be stabke on the price. Meaning we won&amp;#39;t see any major dips but also not any 10x or so over a short period. This may be the only way of Crypto as a currency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously we all want to make some money but the greater cause of Crypto wouod not fulfill that. And I&amp;#39;m ready that one day Crypto won&amp;#39;t be as fun as today but more useful to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
