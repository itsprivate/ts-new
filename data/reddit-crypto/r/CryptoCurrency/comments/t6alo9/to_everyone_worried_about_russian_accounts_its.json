We’ve been blocked out of Binance for 2 years and no one’s said shit, I doubt any of you even knew that we had to pack our shit up and leave, the Russians haven’t even been blocked yet and I’ve seen you people become united as if it were your own accounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Binance owner says blocking innocent Russians accounts is unethical”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We must stand up for all users”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we not innocent? Is it the colour of our skins? What is it? Why are y’all more worried about the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of it happening to Russians but we’ve been kicked out for years and no one batted an eye?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fair enough, I can use other exchanges like KuCoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t even a geographical issue, I’m in Dubai and binance is supported here, but everytime I try to verify my account I get blocked because my Dubai residency card shows where I’m from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the Russians, I’m not mad at you guys, you really shouldn’t be thrown off of exchanges because of your government. I guess I’m just pissy because people fight for you and leave us out in the sun. 🤷🏻‍♂️ &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck the Government. Sanctions don’t affect the government, it affects ordinary, innocent people. The poor American government must think if they use sanctions, the Iranian government will stop being bad because they feel bad for their people suffering. What a joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
