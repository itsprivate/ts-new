The success of broader crypto and the individual projects themselves is not going to be decided in a few days; and if a project&amp;#39;s success is solely confined to a small number of green candles, then it&amp;#39;s probably not going to last long; look at its user base, its pipeline, its developers. Of course if the plan is to trade in the short term, look for trends to capitalise of off; but if you are simply looking for a longer term investment, look beyond a bull market (if this is one). There&amp;#39;ll be plenty more green periods to look forward to if crypto truly comes to be adopted at the rate and to the extent it seems it will.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
