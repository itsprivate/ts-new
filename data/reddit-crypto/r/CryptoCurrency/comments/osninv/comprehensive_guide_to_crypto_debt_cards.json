  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There are over 30 crypto debit cards available on the market. Not all of them are available in every country and I have put the US ones first on the list followed by ones not available in the US. This is a very brief rundown of each card so make sure that you look into them a little more if you decide to get one. Almost every card has a referral offer that includes a bonus for signing up, some like Binance have an offer directly on their website.</p>\n\n<p>A debit card unlike a credit card, requires funds in your account at the time the transaction happens. Some of these cards allow that to be in fiat, others require crypto.</p>\n\n<p>There are a wide range of fee structures that include monthly/yearly fees, staking requirements, bad crypto exchange rates, 1% exchange fees, transaction fees, and other fees. Many of the cards are low fee, but not all.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unbanked Blockcard</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: Currently USA, Latin America and Europe coming</li>\n<li>Fees: $10 for card, $5/month is &lt;$750 transactions, crypto exchange rates to pay bill seem to be 0.3% off of Coinbase. There is $1 fee for PIN based transactions, making this not a good card for things that need to be run as debit.</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: None</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This debit card allows a variety of cryptos to be used to pay for the charges. The exchange rate for the cryptos is really good. The fees can eliminated if you charge enough. There is currently not a rewards structure which puts it behind some other cards, but a positive is how easy it is to pay with various cryptos with little markup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BitPay</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: US, coming to Canada/EU/UK</li>\n<li>Fees: Flat fee for withdrawal from ATM, no fee for card, international fee, $9.95 initial fee</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: none</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes, plus drivers license on social security number</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is an okay card, but not my first choice. Their conversion rates for crypto are decent, they do charge “network and miners fees”, but no flat crypto fee. There currently is not a reward structure and they do allow a large account balance/usage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crypto.com</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: USA, Canada, EU/UK, Singapore</li>\n<li>Fees: Staked CRO $0/$400/$4000/$40000</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: 1%/2%/3%/5%/8%</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> cards are not simple. There are 5 tiers of cards and the level card that you get corresponds to the amount of CRO that you have staked $0/$400/$4000/$40000. The higher tier cards offer additional benefits like Spotify/Netflix/Amazon subscription refunds and AirBnB discounts.</p>\n\n<p>The exchange rate they use for fiat/crypto depends on what country you register. It is often cheapest to pay in fiat vs crypto. They do exclude some merchant codes, like money orders, from earning crypto back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coinbase</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: US (other countries have different fee/award and generally not competitive)</li>\n<li>Fees:  2.49% crypto liquidation fee unless you pay in USDC, foreign transaction fees outside US</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: 4% XLM back or 1% BTC</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Coinbase card is a surprisingly good card. The payment in USDC is a pain and kind of defeats the purpose of paying in crypto. I would purchase the USDC in Coinbase Pro and transfer it to Coinbase. This card should be on your short list if you are in the US.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CoinZoom</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: US and EU (the below applies to the US card, different for other countries)</li>\n<li>Fees: 200 Zoom for card and between 2,000-50,000 zoom required for staking</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: 1%-5% in Zoom and 1%-3% back if you use instant payments from crypto</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think that this is a solid option if you are in the US and want a rewards card. A downside is the staking requirement in the rather obscure Zoom coin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fold App Debit Card</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: US,</li>\n<li>Fees: $21 (they say $0 but activation fee) or $150</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: you spin after each purchase and have a change to get up to 100% back in BTC</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You use fiat to pay for this card like a traditional debit card, but you get crypto rewards. It is a unique system where you “spin” to determine your rewards and only have a short time period to spin after your purchase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spend</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am not going to waste my time writing everything. This card charges 1% for crypto/fiat conversions, not worth getting. Way better options available.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Uphold</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: US, more coming</li>\n<li>Fees: $9.95 card fee</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: 1% USD sourced transaction, 2% crypto purchase</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would really consider this card. You can set the card to use crypto or fiat and earn more back with using fiat. There is not a staking requirement or an annual fee for the card. It is rare to find a debit card with as few requirements and as strong rewards. There is a waitlist to get the card</p>\n\n<p><strong>BlockFi Credit Card (not a debit card)</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: US</li>\n<li>Fees: $200 per year</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: 1.5% in BTC</li>\n<li>KYC: Social Security number</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a credit card and not a debit card. You earn 1.5% back in BTC on all your purchases. I think there are better cash back credit cards that you can buy crypt with than this.</p>\n\n<h1>Cards Not Available in the US</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Eidoo Card</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: EU/UK</li>\n<li>Fees: Complex, basic card requires PNT burn to use, other cards require PNT stake</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: 0-5% based on the card. Referrals reduce the fee and increase the earn rate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This card is novel because it is a DeFi card. It holds your assets in a non-custodial fashion. They use mart contract-based atomic swaps and fiat-backed stablecoins for payments. This is a really interesting card.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nexo Card</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: EU</li>\n<li>Fees: see below</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: flat 2%</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This card works different than all the other debit cards on the list. The Next Card uses your crypto portfolio as collateral and charges ~5% interest until you pay the balance due on the crypto. It does not automatically liquidate crypto to cover your charges. This is a great card if you pay it off daily. It is hard to earn 2% back in the EU, but this card does.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WireX Debit Card</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: Europe, Australia, NZ, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan, Philippines</li>\n<li>Fees: Standard= $0, Premium= ~$7.50/month, Elite= ~$22.50 month</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: Standard 0.5%, Premium 1%, Elite 2%</li>\n<li>KYC: unknown</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>WireX is coming to the US in 2021. They offer awards based on your fee level. The awards and fees must be payed in WXT, their native token. You earn 4%-12% on WXT in your account. You cannot see the exchange rates they offer for crypto without being a member. Check the fee schedule sine they are low fee on some things, but higher fee on other things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nuri Debit Card</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: EU only</li>\n<li>Fees: 1% trading fees</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: None</li>\n<li>KYC: Yes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When they say no fees, there are really are not any fees in the EU for using the card/atm. You send crypto to the account for free, but buying or selling crypto has a 1% fee. ETH and BTC are the only supported currencies</p>\n\n<p><strong>Binance Debit Card</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: EU, up to 0.9% transaction fee</li>\n<li>Fees: $15 initial fee</li>\n<li>Earning Rate: Depends on BNB staked, 0=1%, 10=2%, 50=3%, up to 8%</li>\n<li><strong>Some users are reporting no initial fee and a different staking rewards of 0=0.5%, 1=2%, and so on. This might depend on what country you are applying from and it did list in the terms that it can vary by country.</strong></li>\n<li>KYC: Yes, level 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An EU debit card that offers rewards based on the amount of BNB that you have staked. We all know the drama around Binance at the moment. If you have a large amount BNB staked, I would consider the card. Otherwise, it is ehh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paycent</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locations: most non-US/UK/EU countries</li>\n<li>Fees: $49 and their various cards have 1-2% foreign transaction fees, which could be your home country</li>\n<li>Earning Rate:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A Union Pay card and not that great. The reason it is listed is the huge number of countries that can use the card compared to just about every other one.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The following offer debit cards that do not have a rewards program. I do not think there is a real reason to be interested in them so I am including them for completeness. SatoshoTango Card, Uquid Car, Revolut Metal Card, Bitnovo, Paycent, Change Card, Monolith, Tap Global, SpectroCoin, Crypterium, Cryptopay, Advcash, Trastra, Club Swan Card</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
