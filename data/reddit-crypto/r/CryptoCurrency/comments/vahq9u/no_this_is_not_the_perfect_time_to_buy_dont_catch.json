Don&amp;#39;t hurt yourself for mindlessly buying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course everyone is just afraid they&amp;#39;ll be a bag holder, so the initial reaction would be to save themselves, and how? By making other people buy to protect the prices. Well to be honest, this sub can&amp;#39;t even push the prices up anyway  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might even go downhill even further. It&amp;#39;s a massive dump in a span of 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BTC is down almost down 10%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ETH is down &amp;gt;15%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Most alts I&amp;#39;m watchin are at least 10-20% down&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could very well go down further. Don&amp;#39;t catch falling knives. Just &amp;quot;zooming out&amp;quot; on the daily candles on the BTC chart, we&amp;#39;re obviously in a downtrend for months now, you don&amp;#39;t need to draw lines or use indicators to realize that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course I could be wrong too and I would definitely happy to be proven wrong since I myself just made my regular DCA purchase yesterday, but at this time, this is the most reasonable advice I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just follow your schedule if you&amp;#39;re dca-ing. Buying in bulk now will just hurt your average.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might as well a warning and note to myself cause I&amp;#39;m damned tempted to buy some off of my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
