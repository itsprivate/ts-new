Not sure where you are reading this from, but my area is taking a beating. People are hurting and running themselves into the ground while their rent is in some cases increasing hundreds of percent. I know two couples that have become homeless at some point in the last 3 years. They all work full time. I&#39;m not far from it myself, but now I have my daughter to worry about too. </p>\n\n<p>Having a house, even a old country home, is getting so far from reach that it feels like fantasy. Houses in my city regularly go for 100k+ over the already inflated asking price. Utilities get jealous and rise aswell. </p>\n\n<p>I had a teacher in junior high that I&#39;m not sure actually worked there, but had the most meaningful and informative lectures that I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of witnessing. He talked about many things but one was the &#39;gap between rich and poor&#39; and how it grows. Hard to understand when you&#39;re a 12y/o delinquent. Do I ever see it now. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking at Crypto more and more as my &#39;best chance&#39; to get out of the rat race &amp; leave my daughter with what was originally supposed to be a head start, but now seems like a necessity. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: I view Crypto as essentially one of the only ways to get ahead and leave something behind for my daughter. $0 portfolio or financial security.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
