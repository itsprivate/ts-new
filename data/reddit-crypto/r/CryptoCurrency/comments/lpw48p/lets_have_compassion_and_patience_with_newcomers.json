Sure, crypto is an exceedingly volatile market, and you shouldn&#39;t panic when things drop. But, telling people that this place isn&#39;t for them if there&#39;s some panic just isn&#39;t the way to go. For those of us who have been in this space for a long time, we&#39;ve experienced panic during our first major correction, and believe me it&#39;s no picnic. Sure, you get used to it, but telling someone who just hopped in a few days ago that they don&#39;t belong here doesn&#39;t really make sense. </p>\n\n<p>Imagine seeing a lot of excitement for this new technology everyone is talking about. You do your research, and decide to put in some of your hard-earned money. Suddenly, you lose 10+% of your investment overnight - and all you hear is people telling you that if you&#39;re not thrilled about this, you don&#39;t belong.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, these posts telling you that it&#39;s normal show up at the beginning of every bear market. No one really knows. For sure things seem different this time, with Tesla, Paypal, etc joining the space. But to say with certainty the price can only go up isn&#39;t doing anyone, especially newcomers, any favors. This is most likely just a much-needed correction. All the same, let&#39;s not look down on people that are scared, it&#39;s not fun losing money. </p>\n\n<p>We were all new to this community at some point - let&#39;s treat them with kindness and show them the ropes.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
