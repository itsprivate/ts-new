I&#39;ll be back and rooting for crypto to continue growing and growing, but this was a milestone that I had set for myself and promised my wife if I ever got to this point, I&#39;d pull the trigger. I&#39;ve never broken a promise and never intend to, so I had to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Great luck to all and hopefully I&#39;ll be back in the game sooner than later! Crypto is the future and I know I&#39;m missing out by what I&#39;ve done, but I&#39;m letting my heart win out over my brain this once to fulfill a lifetime goal.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone curious, I&#39;m just some avg 39 yr old dude in Salt Lake City, UT, USA. Nothing special about me, just lucky and patient. 🙂</p>\n\n<p>I wish you all luck on your journey to the moon and beyond, friends!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
