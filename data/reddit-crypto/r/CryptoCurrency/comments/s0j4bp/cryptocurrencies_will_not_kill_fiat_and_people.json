Also, with the help of the central power, states preserve power, and thus peace with all manipulation that comes with it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is precisely those states that will simply never hand over that power, but will jealously guard it, and whatever crypto does, fiat will historically still be there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto will not replace Fiat, but with cryptocurrencies we get one strong alternative that we can use whenever we want, and banks will therefore have to change their business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
