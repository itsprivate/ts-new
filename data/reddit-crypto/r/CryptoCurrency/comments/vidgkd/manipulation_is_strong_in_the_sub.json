This is always laughed at by people saying how bi-polar it is in here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, like everything in social media, I believe there are agendas from bots/paid actors, multi accounts that deliberately push to sentiment here in a bullish/bearish direction for their financial gain. They could be either shorting or going long with heavy positions. When the market shifts directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never interacted with so many experts that say crypto is dead now, and only meant for scams/ponzis - the tech is all BS. I also have received many downvotes for stating that crypto, mainly BTC is fine and will rebound - but when crypto is climbing, its filled with upvotes. This heavy sentiment shift leads me to believe there is an agenda to attack indecisive investor emotions to either sell or buy, so they can profiit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t forget, when there are profits to made that can leverage off the public, the people you are talking to here or other platforms with their crypto advice could actually just be trying to move the market in one direction. In other words they could ultimately believe in BTC but just want to talk crap so you sell, and they scoop up more cheap BTC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stick to your plan no matter what people say who just want you to follow the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
