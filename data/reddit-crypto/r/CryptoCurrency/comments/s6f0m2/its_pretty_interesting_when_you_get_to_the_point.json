I got back into this ages ago, and I&amp;#39;ve gotten so used to the market, I don&amp;#39;t even care when I see my money fluctuate that much. I&amp;#39;m just like, oh, cool, another day. I made 10k or lost 10k over night on a trade, who cares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amazing that it can be like that, I never thought I would see my income streams be that worthless but exciting at the same time. It&amp;#39;s truly exciting but at the same time as of late I&amp;#39;ve learned to check out since we&amp;#39;ve been on a downtrend. My main holdings are in alts so I&amp;#39;m seeing more volatile movement, I&amp;#39;m really big on LUNA and AVAX- I think they are extremely promising projects, I also love Ethereum for obvious reasons like Smart Contracts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even imagine people who wake up each day and lose or gain 1 mil, 5 mil... and to think it&amp;#39;s just perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
