However, I’ve been paying with everything I can through USDC and I’ve already racked up $76.12 in stellar (the recent pumped helped). And that’s only using it through Apple Pay as I haven’t received the card in the mail yet. </p>\n\n<p>Every time I run out of USDC I just add more through Coinbase. It’s free, no fees at all. I’ve been using a card that got me 2% cash back on everything and thought that was good. Now I’m getting double that AND being able to invest in a project I enjoy. </p>\n\n<p>It’s like DCA too since you’re “buying” coins every day, multiple times a day. If you don’t like stellar, you can always convert your rewards to another currency in the app, or send it to another exchange and convert it there. </p>\n\n<p>I really see nothing wrong with the card and would recommend it to anyone. This is a great way to make extra crypto without wasting time doing surveys or games and it beats any other cash back credit card. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Coinbase Debit Card is a great way to stack Stellar coins. You get 4% cash back in the form of stellar. You can choose bitcoin as well but you only get 1%. No fees if you use USDC. Highly recommended.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
