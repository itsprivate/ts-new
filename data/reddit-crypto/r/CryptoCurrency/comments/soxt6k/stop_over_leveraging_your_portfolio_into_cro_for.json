Don’t get me wrong, the benefits are great, but BENEFITS ALONE could never warrant putting such a high percentage of your portfolio into a project that has a lot to prove. While CRO is far from a shitcoin, it is also far from a blue chip, and if crypto.com doesn’t flourish, the coin itself really has little to no use. If you’re shooting for the next card up remember, it’s not a race, slowly work your way there as your portfolio grows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT - First of all, I should have said “over allocating”, not over leveraging. I thought it was obviously enough but that’s on me.   Second, not spreading fud, not scoffing at cro. I’m saying the card and rewards are great, Just a reminder not to over allocate your portfolio for any type of rewards with any company&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
