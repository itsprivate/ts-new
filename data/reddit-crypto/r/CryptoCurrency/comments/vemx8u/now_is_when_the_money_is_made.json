Other coins like Solana and Cardano were in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now a 4x seems much more reasonable. ETH bouncing from $1k back to $4k. BTC getting back to where it was. This could take some time or it might never happen. Still, as the dust settles this sure looks like a buying opportunity with a realistic chance for big gains.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
