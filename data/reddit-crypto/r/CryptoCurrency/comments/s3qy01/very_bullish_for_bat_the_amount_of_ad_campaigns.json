Brave in turn will redistribute the earned BAT as rewards to the users.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The digital ad industry today is worth hundreds of billions, and will grow to a trillion+ dollar industry this decade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those numbers are really bullish for the future of Brave and its token BAT, and i feel like the future is really bright for this project!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
