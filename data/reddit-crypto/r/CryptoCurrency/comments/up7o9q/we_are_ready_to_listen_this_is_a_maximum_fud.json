They say hindsight is 20/20, so maybe all the signs are easier for people to see when it&amp;#39;s already happened, but as we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past week, it&amp;#39;s often far too late for some. There are too many echo chambers and general denial in crypto, not to mention greed. Maybe you&amp;#39;ve been trying to warn people about another crypto project and people just aren&amp;#39;t listening. Well, we’re listening now. What have you been screaming from the rooftops that no one seems willing to hear? What are you predicting is going to go up in flames sooner than everyone thinks? Maybe someday someone will be quoting something you said in this thread as evidence that we were warned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you can, please provide reasons, or even evidence (if you have any) of why you are certain a project won’t work out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
