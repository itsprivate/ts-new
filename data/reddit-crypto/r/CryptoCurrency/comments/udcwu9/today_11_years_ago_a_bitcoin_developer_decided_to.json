  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavin Adresen posted that he&amp;#39;s going to visit CIA to give a presentation at an Emerging conference for the US intelligence community. Remember that he was invited by the CIA for this conference. That means CIA I knew about Bitcoin.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what he posted&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I want to get this out in the open because it is the kind of thing that will generate conspiracy theories: I&amp;#39;m going to give a presentation about Bitcoin at CIA Headquarters in June at an emerging technologies conference for the US intelligence community.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I accepted the invitation to speak because the act that I was invited means Bitcoin is already on their radar, and I think it might be a good chance to talk about why I think Bitcoin will make the world a better place. I think the goals of this project are to create better currency, create a more competitive and efficient international payment incompatible with goals of government.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only very slightly worried that talking about Bitcoin at the CIA will increase the chances that they&amp;#39;ll try to do something we don&amp;#39;t want them to do. I think accepting their invitation and being open about exactly what bitcoin is will make it less likely they will see it as a threat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: Full Disclosure: I&amp;#39;ll be paid a one-time fee of $3K to cover expenses and pay me for my time. I don&amp;#39;t want any &amp;quot;Gavin is on the CIA&amp;#39;s payroll&amp;quot; rumors to get started, either  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as always, comments and questions and discussion welcome. I&amp;#39;d really rather not hear any conspiracy theories about how they will secretly implant a mind-control chip in my head while I&amp;#39;m there, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kg6ngk6hr4w81.jpg?width=1199&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8ef5921104fb19d1e9871ea4638dc2ad48cae672\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/kg6ngk6hr4w81.jpg?width=1199&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8ef5921104fb19d1e9871ea4638dc2ad48cae672&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that Mr. Satoshi never made any post again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=6652.0\"&gt;https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=6652.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
