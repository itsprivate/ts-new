Lightning was proposed 7 years ago and has slowly but surely plodded along. Meanwhile in the alt coin space you had these L2 tokens popping up like flies these past year. Rushing out something barely even decentralised just to get rich off their token floating around in the space. But now Lightning has shown how nonsense these all are. Why do they need their own token to perform scaling solutions&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
