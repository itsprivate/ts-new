Just so the app doesn&amp;#39;t crash in the first few minutes of the launch we&amp;#39;re going to restrict the number of closed beta testers to about 50 or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we&amp;#39;re confident it runs fine (and will have inevitably fixed the bugs that&amp;#39;ll come out of the closed beta) we&amp;#39;ll do an Open Beta followed by a full release.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join us at &lt;a href=\"https://www.np.reddit.com/r/aesirofficial/\"&gt;r/aesirofficial&lt;/a&gt; for more updates or simply apply for closed beta access here: &lt;a href=\"https://aesircrypto.com/signup.html\"&gt;https://aesircrypto.com/signup.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
