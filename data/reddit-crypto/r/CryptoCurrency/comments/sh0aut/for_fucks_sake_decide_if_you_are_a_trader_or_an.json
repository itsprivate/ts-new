So stop bitching about the prices and move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are a trader then you should have minimized your losses at the start of the bear cycle. If you didn&amp;#39;t, then you clearly are not good at what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are a trader you should try using the hype around coins and sell without being too greedy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are an investor just ignore the hype! You want something with long term prospect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just decide what you want to be and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: it seems I have to write another piece about &amp;quot;why you can&amp;#39;t be both&amp;quot; soon. Half of what people say in comments about being both a trader and investor are actually still being only one of them.\nMy understanding is most people here are short term investors. At least according to more than 300 comments I have read so far. And we have very very few actual traders in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regards\nVve&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
