  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You all know these gas fees are too damn high! It&amp;#39;s pretty annoying when you&amp;#39;re trying to move a small amount of crypto and/or anything Ethereum-based from one exchange to another (CEX or DEX) and you&amp;#39;re prompted to pay a fee that feels just ridiculous. \nMy first suggestion to anyone trying to minimize the fees would be to check out the withdrawal/network fees for XLM (Stellar Lumens) on their exchange. \nWhile every exchange will be a bit different, here&amp;#39;s how much it would cost for me to withdraw the Top 15 coins (incl. stablecoins, except for BUSD) from a CEX (KuCoin) right now:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTC: 0.0005 BTC (~$20.25)\nETH: 0.00625 ETH (~$18.98)\nUSDT: 35 USDT ($35)\nBNB: 0.01 BNB (~$4.17)\nUSDC: 15 USDC ($15)\nXRP: 0.25 XRP (~$0.20)\nSOL: 0.01 SOL (~$1.01)\nADA: 1 ADA (~$0.95)\nLUNA: 0.05 LUNA (~$4.02)\nAVAX: 0.01 AVAX (~$0.77)\nDOGE: 20 DOGE (~$2.94)\nDOT: 0.1 DOT (~$1.83)\nUST: 2 UST ($2)\nSHIB: 1,100,000 SHIB (~$28.42)\nWBTC: 0.0007 WBTC (~$28.35)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;XRP is the cheapest here at a pretty modest $0.20 withdrawl fee. Not too shabby.\nNow, as someone who is also a fan of NANO, I had to check that one too:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;XNO (NANO): 0.02 XNO (~$0.04)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, 4 pennies is pretty damn cheap so what&amp;#39;s the big deal? Why XLM? Well...:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;XLM: 0.02 XLM (~$0.0041)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It costs &lt;em&gt;less than half of a single penny&lt;/em&gt; to withdraw my XLM from KuCoin. To compare, I&amp;#39;d pay over &lt;em&gt;10 times more money&lt;/em&gt; to withdraw NANO instead. On top of that, XLM is a tradable currency at a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more exchanges than NANO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tested this out by sending 10.5 XLM (~$2.10) from Coinbase Pro to Binance.US to KuCoin, then BACK to Coinbase Pro. All 3 CEX withdrawls cost me a grand total of 0.03 XLM (~$0.006), leaving me with 10.47 XLM (~$2.094). Still not even a &lt;em&gt;single penny&lt;/em&gt; in fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, trading fees exist and vary from exchange to exchange. Some have free currency conversion, some don&amp;#39;t. So swapping from your preferred currency to XLM and back might cost a small amount of money, but it will still &lt;em&gt;very likely&lt;/em&gt; be cheaper than withdrawing the original currency itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of you have a strategy like this that you use, or one that&amp;#39;s even better, I&amp;#39;d love to hear it! \nAnd of course, be sure to do your own research before trying this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
