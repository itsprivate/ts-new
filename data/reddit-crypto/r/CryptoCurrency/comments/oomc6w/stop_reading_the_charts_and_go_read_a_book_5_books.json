Watching charts is nice but useless if you are not a day trader. Reading and learning about crypto is better. I know a lot of people who watch charts all day, every hour and do nothing else, it brings nothing to them. So take a book and read ! Even a fictional book totally not about crypto, just read !</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Book Of Satoshi (Phil Champagne)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This book is a collection of the essential writings of the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Even if we still didn&#39;t know his true identity, when he was active, he posted a lot of emails and online forum posts and this book contains all the most important things, like his explanation of how Bitcoin works. Interesting to know his vision and to understand the first cryptocurrency in the world !</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Age Of Cryptocurrency (Paul Vigna &amp; Michael Casey)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This book is written by two journalists and is really well written. It is a really introductive book, but complete and easy to understand for all people. They speak about the relationship between cryptocurrencies and the global financial crisis and about how blockchain can change the financial system.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Basics Of Bitcoins And Blockchains (Antony Lewis)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Written by an early adopter and cryptocurrency expert who worked for itBit (now Paxos), this book clearly breaks down the technical aspects of blockchain technology in a way that is understandable by everyone, within and outside of the crypto space. This book covers the fundamentals but is also a useful guide for the blockchain and its applications.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Little Bitcoin Book</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This book, published in 2019, was written by a collective of authors committed to promoting Bitcoin and its democratization. This book is a really basic book about Bitcoin and what it is and why it will be essential for the future and for the financial world. A little too basic if you are already in crypto, it is more for the beginner, for your family who want to understand.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A History Of Money  (Glyn Davies)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This book is about more than cryptocurrency, it is about the money, the financial system since it existed. It is interesting to see how the world has created all we know about money, and how we finally arrive to the time of cryptocurrency. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I really believe that reading is good for everyone, it allows the mind to think about something else than &quot;buy the dip&quot; or &quot;I bought too early&quot;. Just learn about crypto, blockchain and bitcoin. Or even read someting else, a fictional book or learn a music instrument I don&#39;t know! Stop watching the charts every minute.</p>\n\n<p>All these books are on amazon, or for free on internet (you know about the library genesis).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
