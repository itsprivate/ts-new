Genuinely curious, why can’t we all just be happy for each other when someone here is making money and is in profit from their investments? If someone else’s crypto is making them money, what do you achieve by bashing them and being salty towards them? We’re all trying to make money here lol (besides the people in it for the tech).

Besides the obvious pnd scams, let’s be happy for each other 💯 we’re all putting in our hard earned money with the purpose of being financially independent.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
