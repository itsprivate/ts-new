He was taken aback when setting it up and understanding crypto addresses and his private key and asked me to help him through it. I did and he grasped it well enough. But it was by no means as “simple” as a debit card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without going into a million of other examples into how complicated crypto can be, to put it simply, crypto needs to adopt a more streamlined ease-of-use interface or it will never go mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love crypto, but it is too convoluted for its own good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
