We just think that “its too late” cause people like us are constantly exposed to crypto news when in actuality most people either still dont care enough or dont know about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the crypto market will have a really long run from here. Start investing early into projects with actual utility and technology like Ethereum or even MATIC considering they helped people save hundreds of millions of dollars on Ethereum gas fees over this entire period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t asume that “we’re too late” just cause someone on this sub said so.
