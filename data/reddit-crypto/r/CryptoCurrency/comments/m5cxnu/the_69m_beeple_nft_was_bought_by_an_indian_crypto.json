The govt doesn&#39;t realise such a state is literally a 4 hour flight away. Metakovan could have paid millions in taxes to India, but due to the govt&#39;s stupidity he pays taxes to Singapore. Soon many Indian crypto investors will follow suit. </p>\n\n<p>Indian govt has shown it does not comprehend finances and doesnt give two shits about the people. They have constantly terrorised their own people by banning fiat currency notes, rendering millions of people unable to use their own hard earned funds. The govt gets sadistic pleasure seeing queues of people outside ATMs during the demonetisation. Hundreds of Indians died and the govt didnt give a fuck. They are not going to give a shit about crypto either. </p>\n\n<p>The entire Modi govt tenure is littered with financial mis-steps that have ruined the economy. Meanwhile the second highest finance ministry lawmaker Anurag Thakur is a potty mouth rabble rouser. He goes to rallies and shouts &quot;shoot the traitors&quot;. Somehow such a moron is fit to become Finance Minister in this government. Modi himself is an arsonist who sat and watched as thousands were burnt to death in Gujarat riots. Many interviews and statements show he himself was instrumental in staging the riots, and people close to him gave calls to burn citizens aline. He was on worldwide black list before he got elected as Prime Minister. Such people should be tried for war crimes, not celebrated as a leader.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
