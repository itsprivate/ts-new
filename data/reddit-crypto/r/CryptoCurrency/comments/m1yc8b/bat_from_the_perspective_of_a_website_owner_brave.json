I then got to see that I had a balance of about 32 BAT already. Not a ton, but what that immediately did is tell me that there&#39;s at least SOMETHING here. </p>\n\n<p>If you have a decently trafficked website, you&#39;ll get worthless emails by the dozen. So I think seeing some BAT waiting was really important. &#39;OK, lets continue down this road and see where it leads&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wallet Linking and Being Paid - Meh</strong></p>\n\n<p>Currently, the time delay for just about every action you do seems crazy. There&#39;s at least a day or two delay for the verification to show up, for the wallet verification to show up, your banner to update (still hasn&#39;t happened), and the Brave Browser seems to like switching between having me fully verified, and saying I&#39;m unable to accept tips.   </p>\n\n<p>The above issues made me wonder whether I actually would get my BAT. But I did. Payments were &#39;processing&#39; for about a week.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>BAT Earnings Once Setup - Surprisingly Good</strong></p>\n\n<p>So how long would it take me to earn another 32 BAT? About 3 days. For website owners that get to this point, <strong>this was the best surprise so far.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My websites are supported by ads. I use your standard Google ads. I&#39;ve always previously wrote off Brave users as people that would earn me nothing. To earn something? That&#39;s actually pretty great. I did turn on the &#39;Allow Brave to show ads on my site&#39; option within Brave Creators. </p>\n\n<p>Initially I wasn&#39;t sure what I thought about ad monetization being done at the browser level instead of me controlling everything at a site level (I know I can turn ads on/off). Thinking about it more, that&#39;s <strong>the most exciting part</strong> about BAT from a website owner&#39;s perspective. It&#39;s the best implementation of this paradigm shift so far, and I&#39;m happy to be part of this journey and see where it goes. </p>\n\n<p><strong>A few details about my site for perspective</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>200k users/day spread out all over the world</li>\n<li>niche is in the wallpaper space. So subscription rates are low. The whole game is have content people are searching for; they find it, grab it, and then 99% go on their way. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>tldr;</strong> Creators program seems to have lots of growing pains but is actually earning consistent BAT. I see lots of potential as the program continues and matures.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
