  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;51k BTC were just moved onto Binance today. Are we about to get dumped on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of fucken btc. I was hoping for a little pumpy wumpy after all the dumpy we’ve been handed…but, something tells me whicer moved these btc aren’t using these for a leveraged longs, they’re going to dump on the market. On our faces. Without asking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could also be a mind game to psych out dorks who look at this shit. What’s your take? Are we a out to get dumped on? It’ll just be more hodl ti e if we do, but it’d be nice to get out of this goddam range we’ve been in for a year now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There’s an off-chance its just some exchange maintenance , binance moving their own from cold wallet to exchange type ish, but that seems’s unlikely. Every time i’ve seen this in the past, except for one, we ended up getting dumped on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will having mentioned the dump here make it not happen by virtue of the existential law “nobody on &lt;a href=\"/r/cryptocurrency\"&gt;r/cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; is ever right , about anything, under any circumstances”?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/Balance\"&gt;https://www.coinglass.com/Balance&lt;/a&gt;\nAbout 30k of the coins ha e already moved back off exchange.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
