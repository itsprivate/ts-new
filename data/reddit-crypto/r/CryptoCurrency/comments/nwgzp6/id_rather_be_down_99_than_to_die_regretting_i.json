I&#39;ve experienced 3 big slaps in the face in my life not taking the chance when I easily could.</p>\n\n<h2>1999</h2>\n\n<p>21 years ago I was in a business school for programming.  I was On my way to barnes and noble to pick up a C++ book when I heard on the radio Barnes and Noble stock flash crashing to a $1 from about $25-$30.    </p>\n\n<p>I felt something wasn&#39;t right about that because the chain was still fairly new, and it was always packed.  So many books and magazine sales.   They where also building more.    I was about to drop $3500. \nMy friend&#39;s father hooked me up with a broker to call.     I called and found out I needed a bank account so I did a bunch of scrambling but when push came to shove I backed out.  I convinced myself buying a new laptop,some nice clothes, and the new bass system I wanted for my car was money better spent instead of a risk. </p>\n\n<p>I literally backed out at the last moment after a tedious process.  </p>\n\n<p>Well one month later or so, it was back up to $20-$25. </p>\n\n<p>I missed out on $60-$75,000</p>\n\n<h1>2006</h1>\n\n<p>I think 🤔</p>\n\n<p>Apple announces the iPhone and it was super popular.   I knew it was gonna get bigger, and shares were still $1 lol    I wanted to put about $2K down.   Did the same thing again, got in touch with a Broker then backed out.    </p>\n\n<p>That was over 100x gain.    That was Lambo.</p>\n\n<p>Why did I back out?  For temporary items when the ones I have are working just fine? </p>\n\n<p>So when I met someone in 2016, I had that gut feeling again.   And I didn&#39;t care if I lost it I just didn&#39;t want to miss another opportunity going against what I really feel </p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m holding now and I&#39;ve been in the green for a long time because I got in early. </p>\n\n<p>It wasnt luck. It was motivation to make something happen.    I&#39;m just a regular guy that didn&#39;t want to miss my chance so I took it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
