Most big investors didn&#39;t get rich by gambling and coming up big, they were patient</strong></p>\n\n<p>The reason everyone tells you to stop checking your portfolio every two minutes is because natural price action is almost completely negligible in a short time-frame.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The only people who need to check the markets frequently are those who actually day-trade, and make money in the short term.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Any big jumps in price, <strong>especially</strong> those within a few days are destined for a harsh correction, though they usually find a higher bottom resistance and progressively increases as time goes on... </p>\n\n<p><em>Confused?</em></p>\n\n<p>Think of it this way; </p>\n\n<p><strong>Buy</strong> = price goes up\n<strong>Sell</strong> = price goes down\n<strong>Buy &amp; HODL</strong> = price goes up, but finds a higher bottom each price jump so long as people continually HODL (This is also assuming that the supply of the project in question is limited)</p>\n\n<p><em>Example</em></p>\n\n<p>BTC starts at $2 and starts to increase to $3. </p>\n\n<p>People frenzy and buy which in turn pushes the price to $5. (Green candles)</p>\n\n<p>People who bought early sell at $5 thinking it&#39;s the top (red candles), meanwhile people who bought at $5 have to protect their investment, and HODL hoping that people will buy again in the future.</p>\n\n<p>These HODLERS limit the purchasable supply, which makes the price settle at $4 instead of $2 where we started.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This process repeats itself indefinitely for years, which is why BTC is now hanging around the $50,000 range</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you realistically expect your project&#39;s price to increase and never drop, you&#39;d basically have to convince the person who bought BTC at $2, that he&#39;s just as safe if he bought at $50,000, $100,000, etc, etc....</p>\n\n<p>When you see a project increase by 50% or more within a day or two, that&#39;s a sure sign of FOMO at work (project reaches a new milestone, X company adopts this project, or a P&amp;D) - though the latter is really only when you&#39;re talking about shitcoins.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone and their dog wants a piece of the action, and this buy frenzy creates green candles until people aren&#39;t willing to buy at such a high price any longer. When this happens, the price will retrace, and this cycle continues until the &quot;buy power&quot; isn&#39;t as strong and continuous as it was when the frenzy started...</p>\n\n<p><strong>IF THE MAJORITY OF BUY ORDERS STAYS CONSISTENT, AND PEOPLE KEEP THEIR FUNDS HELD, THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET/CRYPTO WILL INCREASE</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why does all this matter?</p>\n\n<p>Because <strong>any natural growth of a crypto cannot increase indefinitely if people are not willing to consistently buy at higher prices and refuse to sell.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When people on <a href=\"/r/CC\">/r/CC</a> are telling you to stop checking your portfolio, it&#39;s because natural growth isn&#39;t something that happens in a short time-frame and in most cases <strong>is not sustainable</strong></p>\n\n<p>Checking your portfolio in the short term is a VERY good way to make bad decisions when you could ultimately be setting yourself up for success in the future....</p>\n\n<p>If you believe in the projects you invested in, HOLD your goddamn coins, and the rest will take care of itself....</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
