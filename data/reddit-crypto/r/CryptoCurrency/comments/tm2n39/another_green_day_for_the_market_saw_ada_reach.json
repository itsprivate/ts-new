Following the news of Apes (bored ones) working with GME, market saw a rally around metaverse projects. Apecoin itself saw more than 15% rise in price (currently rank 86). Several other metaverse projects (like Axis infinity and its SLP, enjin, star Atlas) saw some nice gains too. it is very hard to say if it is just a phase or gonna have long lasting effect on the whole trend tho.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Altcoins also saw some long overdue rises. Carano saw almost 17% to the monthly high of 1.15$ which is by no mean near ATH of 3.09$ but still a source of joy for long time hodlers struggling with sluggish price action for several months now.\nOther big gainers include: Dogecoin (14.6%) and Near(10.2%). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most alts are green today and most stablecoins are red. Just how we like it! (Unless you missed the last dip like me which is very very sad).\nMarket doesn&amp;#39;t seem whiling to give up 2 trillion floor too. Which is a nice change of scenery to be honest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have fun you all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
