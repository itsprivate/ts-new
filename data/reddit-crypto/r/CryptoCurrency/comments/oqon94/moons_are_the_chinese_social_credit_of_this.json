With moons, every time you make a post, or write a comment, there is a voice in the back of your head saying &quot;<em>will this be liked? Maybe I shouldn&#39;t say that because I won&#39;t get paid. Maybe I should not express what I really think, instead what the people love, and I&#39;ll get some money for it</em>&quot;... In my opinion, it <strong>completely</strong> changes the structure of a subreddit, way beyond having some karma points go up or down.</p>\n\n<p>Even with writing this up I know it won&#39;t get liked by a lot of people in here, I&#39;m gonna get downvoted, some stupid comments are gonna fly my way, and in turn those comments will try to farm moons, even if their authors don&#39;t believe them. But I don&#39;t care. I try not to care. I used to not care. I used to not give a shit about what I post online. </p>\n\n<p>I know there are a lot of people out there like me, who would hate to see their favorite website turn into a farm for money.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
