So long as you stick to holding through the storm (even if you are at a significant loss) the charts historically show that you will come out on top in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be honest though, it&amp;#39;s easier said than done. As crypto is so volatile and the majority of holders are sitting on significant losses, it might be tempting to panic sell at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I firmly believe if we hold, DCA with whatever spare change we have, we will all come out much wealthier when crypto inevitably bounces back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
