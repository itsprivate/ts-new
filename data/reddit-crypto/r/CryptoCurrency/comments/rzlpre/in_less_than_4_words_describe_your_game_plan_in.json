Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Day Trading&lt;/em&gt;  - As a digital asset investor, you should be familiar with various resources and strategies. Basically, there are two types of trading strategies you can choose from. Active, which requires more time and attention and involves constant monitoring, and passive, which allows for a more hands-off approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trend Tading&lt;/em&gt; - One of the active strategies, trend trading, also sometimes known as position trading, is a tactic in which an investor will hold their position for a longer span of time, usually a few months. If you choose to be a trend trader, you need to keep up with directional trends and know how to take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scalping&lt;/em&gt; - The last active strategy on our list is scalping, which focuses on small moves repeated over and over again and taking advantage of inefficiencies in the market such as gaps in liquidity. Scalpers open and close their positions in a short period of time, sometimes even in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HODL&lt;/em&gt; - If none of the active strategies seem like something you would be interested in, you might explore passive ones such as the buy and hold strategy. In this strategy, investors purchase a large sum of assets and hold it for a long time without paying attention to market fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Index Investing&lt;/em&gt; - Finishing off with another passive investment strategy, index investing focuses on buying ETFs, which you can purchase on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. You can create a crypto index by creating a basket of all of your assets and then making a special token that will track their combined performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
