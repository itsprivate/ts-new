Making sure everything I did was safe and calculated and non stressful. Just meander through and die. Such is life and what can you do about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then enter crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m 29 and have been semi successful. I’ve always been happy with where I was and never super stressed out about anything. Get the 8-5 M-F job. Log off at 5 every day. Go to the gym. Play some videogames. Got married. Was happy. Figured everything would work out as long as I played by the system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But man has crypto lit a fire under my ass. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been super on top of money. Spent it wisely, got a house early. Been ok with it. But after crypto I researched everything constantly. I consolidated old 401ks. Opened an IRA, maxed out my current 401k match. Sold my house because I had a place to be rent free for as long as I needed for a new house and it wasn’t the best neighborhood to be in. Made a nice return on proceeds. Was able to have a dream wedding from it. Invested a good amount of safe money into crypto. Got a crypto.com card for rewards. Got another simple credit card. Boosted my credit from 680 to 720. Did much better at work since I had new motivation and got raises and promotions from. Love working OT because thats more money to have and invest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is my portfolio in the red? Again, yes lol. But I don’t care. Playing the long game and getting all my other finances in order has been part of the journey. Couldn’t be happier with where I am at in life now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
