I could double our money in less than 24 hours. I like games and I sure as hell like a good gamble. And that’s what shitcoins pretty much are. Sure, every coin has to start somewhere but unfortunately, scammers have made it hard to pick out the legit ones.</p>\n\n<p>I was wanting a gamble though, so I didn’t care. I’m going to name the coin because it’s now worthless but I think it’s a good idea to say it. It was a sexy name and can easily be used again in a scam. Frostfire. </p>\n\n<p>I found it at around 6pm on the day it launched. It was around 10 minutes old and only had a few wallets. I searched Reddit and google. Nothing. I bought some anyways. I wanted a gamble. I put $50 in and got 1 trillion coins. Sweet.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to an hour later, I was up double my money. My boyfriend told me to pull out but I couldn’t. Fomo was real.</p>\n\n<p>Another hour later I was up to $200. Boyfriend told me to pull out but I definitely wasn’t at this point. And I found a telegram for it.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to 4 hours later and I believe I was up to $1k. My boyfriend was sleeping and I was riding this out.</p>\n\n<p>8-10 hours after putting $50 in, the market cap hit 1million. My $50 was now over $5k. I couldn’t pull out at this point. I was so sure I’d hit the jackpot. I felt like those damn baboons that fall for the salt traps in the Amazon. I thankfully pulled out $500 just in case.</p>\n\n<p>I woke up the next morning to it being down to $2k. Not great but it’s ok. It’s only stabilizing I told myself. The dev got active on telegram and a bunch of people started buying again. Back up to $4k almost $1million mc.</p>\n\n<p>There were a lot of red flags on telegram and a lot of bots in the Reddit comments but I chose to ignore them. Then over the next day we got slowly rug pulled until my $5k was worth $200 that I managed to pull before it was completely worthless. The dev deleted the website and telegram.</p>\n\n<p>Ouch. I spent the next week trying to find the next Frostfire and lost about $200. And then I just started looking up new coins on bscscan and lurking the telegram and poocoin out of curiosity. I made a rule that no matter how much I believed in a coins potential I wouldn’t buy a brand new shitcoin until it survived the first week at least.</p>\n\n<p>Guess what? They never did.</p>\n\n<p>My advice? Don’t put your money into a coin unless it’s been audited. I did my homework every time and even when there was a burn wallet and no major whales, a liquidity pool, a rug pull always happened. </p>\n\n<p>And if you’re going to anyways, expect your money to be gone.</p>\n\n<p>Best way to get rich? Do some good DD and put any money that you don’t need into some projects that have a purpose or aim to satisfy a need. And don’t ever chase losses.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re still here, have a great weekend and feel free to share your story if you have one.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
