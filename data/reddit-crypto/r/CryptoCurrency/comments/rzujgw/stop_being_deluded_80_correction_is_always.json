Let me hit you with some facts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nov 2013. Bitcoin hits ATH of 1154$ and corrects to 227$ in Aug 2015. hitting new ATH Apr 2017.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dec 2017. ATH of 19500$, corrects to 3300$ in Jan 2019. hitting new ATH Dec 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nov 2021. ATH of 69000$.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What have we learned? It takes around 2 years from ATH to hit bottom, and 2 more years to hit new ATH. And corrections are around 80%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Retail and Industry are now heavily involved in cryptocurrency‘s, it went mainstream last year, The richest man in the world openly share the fact they HODL. I helped my mother set her account up last month! This is not the same space anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Jxntb733\"&gt;u/Jxntb733&lt;/a&gt; is 2y old account and surely wasn&amp;#39;t here in 2018. when McAfee said bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new financial paradigm. People also said Bitcoin is now too big to be a bubble. That&amp;#39;s like the biggest red flag in bubbles, when people claim that something is too big to fail. You know, like Dot com bubble was too big to explode, 2008. housing market, and now crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, what&amp;#39;s exactly different then 2018? People still use crypto for one and only purpuse: to watch it grow in fiat value. Also, different is that now we have modern day Tulip mania called NFT&amp;#39;s, we have rupulls, awful memecoins, and more scams. I haven&amp;#39;t seen bigger adoption then 4 years ago. Also, should I mention Tether printing usdt without any backing? Blockchain still haven&amp;#39;t founded a single problem to solve since 2018. All I see is hype, new shitcoins, new NFTs, new scams, talks is still only about price, gains, profits. I&amp;#39;m sorry but Bitcoin is no better then 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, after this snap back to reality, I just want to say that&amp;#39;s completely ok if Bitcoin hits 20k or even 10k before next rally to 100k in this decade. You just need to be rational with your money and patient. I belive in cryptocurrencies in long run. Stay safe and hydrated bros.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
