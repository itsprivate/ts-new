  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>One of the main things keeping a lot of people from getting into crypto is the volatility of the market. A large part of that is due to massive amounts of shorts or longs being liquidated over a short period of time. Earlier today, almost $215 million in crypto positions were liquidated within about an hour, causing a sizable drop in price for almost every asset. This may be temporary, and we&#39;ve definitely seen worse, but I do think this kind of volatility only delays widespread adoption. </p>\n\n<p>When we have big sudden drops or spikes in price, it&#39;s almost always because people just can&#39;t resist trading with leverage. I don&#39;t know how many times people here have said to stay away from leverage, but people just can&#39;t resist the chance to make a lot of money in a short period of time. With how volatile the crypto market is, it&#39;s really not worth it. Honestly, you are much more likely to get liquidated than make money from leverage trading. All you&#39;re doing is contributing to volatility in the market, and most likely throwing away your hard-earned cash. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t leverage trade. Even if you think you know what you&#39;re doing, you almost certainly don&#39;t. Buy low, DCA, stake, lend, and grow your money over time. It&#39;s a much more stable and far less risky way to make money. Widespread adoption will come even sooner if the market is stable. Just stay away from leverage guys.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
