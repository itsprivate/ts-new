But while he was shaking his head no he says.  <em>Nah , You can&#39;t be doing that for long, your talking a big risk the longer you keep it in</em> </p>\n\n<p>I asked him if he traded crypto before and he said &quot;no never&quot;.    Then I asked if he&#39;s into stocks.  He said &quot;no never&quot;.  But he heard stories. </p>\n\n<p>Idk bout you people reading this thread but...  I hear stories too.  All the time. I&#39;ve heard stories about aliens also.  </p>\n\n<p>But this whole time he&#39;s smoking a cigarette, and he&#39;s got scratch off tickets. </p>\n\n<p>He&#39;s a cool guy but I just felt like slapping the cigarette off his face, Grabbing him by the neck and screaming down his throat while I&#39;m holding the cigarettes to his face...</p>\n\n<p><em>YOU SEE THIS, THIS IS A RISK! THIS WILL KILL YOU, SO WHY DUMPING $300 A MONTH INTO IT</em>??</p>\n\n<p>But I didn&#39;t.   The nerve of these people. Telling me to sell off my crypto.     It&#39;s better holding crypto to 0 than smoke risking cancer.\nBut I bet he wouldn&#39;t tell me to quit cigs If I was smoking.  $300 a month is $3600 a year.  These people smoke at least 10 more years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
