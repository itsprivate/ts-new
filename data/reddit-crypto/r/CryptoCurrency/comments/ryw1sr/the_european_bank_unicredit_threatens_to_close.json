He complained that he couldn&amp;#39;t send money to FTX or Crypto.com&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The support told him to not do it because it&amp;#39;s against the bank&amp;#39;s policy. He asked where this policy was written and  the answer was &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not written in the contract, it&amp;#39;s just a policy we have&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The customer service told him also that anyone who tries to send money to any crypto exchange will be reported (to whom? Lol) and their account will be terminated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After this post became trending on Twitter, the official Unicredit account tweeted a statement confirming that their policies forbid customers to send money to any crypto exchange.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see the thread here, however it&amp;#39;s written in Italian but you can use Google translate: \n&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniCredit_IT/status/1479527599890173952?t=9PYE2-UqUCvtIdRMHjZEsw&amp;amp;s=19\"&gt;https://twitter.com/UniCredit_IT/status/1479527599890173952?t=9PYE2-UqUCvtIdRMHjZEsw&amp;amp;s=19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have an account at Unicredit because it&amp;#39;s a terrible bank previously related with the worse politicians in the country, however it&amp;#39;s a big European bank (mostly Italian and French) so I advise every customer to close their account and move to another bank.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
