Yes, this is largely due to this being a major hub for crypto news, but advice I’ve been given by others on here has definitely helped me out too. Here are some of the best pieces of advice I’ve been given:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BTC/ETH should make up around 70% of your portfolio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staking as a method of passive income&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earning free BAT through the Brave browser&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to set up a hard wallet, and why I should&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance of understanding Tokenomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 of my top 5 gainers this year were introduced to me through this sub (won’t name as this isn’t a shill post)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sub definitely isn’t all that bad, and there are some very smart people in here. What’s the best piece of advice you’ve been given on this sub?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Some great mentions in the comments that I feel should be highlighted in the main body (as I know some won’t bother to read the comments)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time in the market &amp;gt; timing the market&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube is generally a bad place for Crypto information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
