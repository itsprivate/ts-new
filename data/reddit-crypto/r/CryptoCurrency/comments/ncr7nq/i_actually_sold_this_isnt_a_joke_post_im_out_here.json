  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So, first off, you might be wondering, why sell now? &quot;This cycle still has months to go! ETH will hit $10k! BTC will hit $100k&quot; - well, maybe you&#39;re right (now that I&#39;ve sold, you&#39;re probably right!), I actually do believe that the market still has a few months left in it, after all, we bounced back pretty well after this recent dip, but, I had a goal and I have to stick to that goal.</p>\n\n<p>For me, the goal was paying off my mortgage.</p>\n\n<p>I know that most users here have only like $500 invested, so, it&#39;s easy to scream &quot;HODL!&quot; but, believe me, once you get close to your goal, those dips become scary. For me, the weekend &quot;dip&quot; wiped off $40k in value. That $40k meant not paying off the loan, &quot;damn, i was so close,&quot; I thought.</p>\n\n<p>And here&#39;s the thing, I&#39;ve been just above the goal for a week or so, but I held because I got greedy - I bought into the hype. That &#39;dip&#39; was a nice little reminder, &quot;don&#39;t get greedy, stick to your goal and sell&quot;, so I waited for the dip to rise as best as I could and for the goal figure to be reached again (luckily this happened) and I sold.</p>\n\n<h1>Some history and lessons learned along the way</h1>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been interested in crypto for many years, so I&#39;d like to reflect on that time and put the lessons learned from each phase into a simple table here for y&#39;all:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Year</th>\n<th align=\"left\">What happened</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Lesson learned</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Somewhere around 2010-2011</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I remember talking to friends about BTC hitting $1 USD. They were skeptical and I didn&#39;t look into it further.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Learn and read more, don&#39;t listen to others.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2012</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I looked into buying on Mt Gox but decided against it because it would mean sending personal information to Japan - I decided this was too risky.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Sometimes, you have to take a risk. Back then BTC was worth hardly anything, but my concern was a shady company in another part of the world having my passport details.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2013-2014</td>\n<td align=\"left\">After some time away from PCs, I built a machine and decided to try some mining. I joined mining pools (like Nicehash) that later exit scammed and lost funds.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Not your keys, not your crypto. I kept my mining rewards on the pools website and also moved some to a dodgy trading platform that disappeared (Cryptsy)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2014-2015</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I heard about the ETH ICO and had brief look into it but was too distracted with other financial matters so again did not buy.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">This time there were no friends dissuading me, in fact, it was someone who I cannot remember messaging me and suggesting I look at ETH. I wasn&#39;t paying enough attention and didn&#39;t explore further.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2015-2016</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Somewhere around here BTC was at like $1k USD. I remember thinking it was way overpriced.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Don&#39;t assume you know the right price of anything.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2017</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Mania and hype. I had stopped paying attention to BTC. A friend mentioned that it had hit $10k USD. I fired up some of my old mining wallets and transferred them to exchanges and got serious.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The best time to invest was yesterday, the next best time is today. I had missed out enough, it was time to take the plunge. I had also been wrong about BTC (see above), so I wouldn&#39;t take the risk again that &quot;$10k is too high&quot; like some friends said at the time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2018</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The crash. I had invested in but seems it was too late, everything cratered.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">HODL. I had read enough to know and understand that there might be another market cycle, there SHOULD be another cycle. I held onto basically coins that went -90%. I also learned that BTC is king, there would be no new bull market until BTC lead that charge, so I moved most of my value to BTC and told myself I&#39;d wait.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2019-2020</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Buying here and there. Unfortunately I missed the 2020 low because I needed money for other things, but toward the end of the year I got very interested in ETH 2.0 and decided I wanted to have a validator node (32 ETH). I used savings and my tax return to buy in.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Buy in a bear market, sell in a bull market. Buy in what you believe in and do the research. After being lax about learning I dove headfirst into ETH. I tested staking on the testnet, I played with DeFI.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2021</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Our current bull cycle and hitting a personal goal.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">From the beginning, I knew that I didn&#39;t care if I&#39;d get rich and become a millionaire, my main goal was to pay off my house, if I could do that, that would be enough. Well, I hit that goal, went above it actually, and as you read in my intro, got greedy waiting for more gains since this &quot;is just the beginning&quot;. A major dip shattered that greed and helped me realise that I should stick to the plan. I sold. Don&#39;t be greedy.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>There you have it, many lessons learned throughout the years, but if I had to distill it into the most important ones:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Actually use the things you&#39;re buying, test them for yourself</strong>. Make sure you really believe in what you hold, and not just because people are saying it will moon.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy in a bear market.</strong> And yes, there will be a bear market, of course, maybe not now, maybe in 6 months, but there will be one. Be ready. That is where I made my biggest gains. I know, this part is hard, when things are really bad (remember when BTC hit $4k in the &quot;dip&quot;), everyone loses faith and thinks, &quot;it&#39;s going to $1k&quot; - but that is just greed. DCA your way in for best results if you have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Stick to your goals.</strong> Don&#39;t be like me and get greedy, only to then get spooked. Thankfully, everything bounced back, but what if it didn&#39;t? I would&#39;ve missed paying off my house because I got greedy waiting for ETH to rise even further.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>Truthfully, I will never completely move away from crypto. I believe in it long term. Hell, I had less anxiety about moving BTC and ETH around than I did about requesting my exchange to withdraw to fiat.</p>\n\n<p>Who knows, everyone here is still super positive, the sub keeps getting new members (or maybe it&#39;s just people creating alt accounts?) the run keeps going, BTC hits $100k, ETH hits $10k and I will look at it like, &quot;damn, maybe I should&#39;ve held,&quot; but that&#39;s OK, it&#39;s very hard to time the market and hit the top just like you can pretty much never buy the bottom. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll live with that because I&#39;ll have achieved at least one major goal. </p>\n\n<p>I hope you guys can do the same, and I hope you have the fortitude to &#39;hodl&#39; when you need to, and sell when you need to, when it&#39;s your choice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
