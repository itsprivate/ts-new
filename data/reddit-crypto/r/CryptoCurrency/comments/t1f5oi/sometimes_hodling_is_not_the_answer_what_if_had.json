I actually sold around 55k and slowly started seeing that Bitcoin isnt the right investment for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started staking and went heavy on DeFi projects like AAVE since they’re the best at lending (which gave me a lot of leverage)and new ones like BitDAO which have the largest treasury in the market so the governance power behind it was strong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TAKING PROFITS IS NOT SHAMEFUL.\nI don’t know why this sub treats it as a sin. Its actually smart to sell if you make an educated decision as to when.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
