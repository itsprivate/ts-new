I thought checking the community size on Reddit would be interesting since a common piece of advice when evaluating a currency / token is to check the community it has supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled most of these currencies from the top 50 on CoinMarketCap and the listing of Specific Coin Subreddits from the sidebar here.  If it looks familiar, I submitted this as a Google Sheets link yesterday but was told people would prefer not to click links.  Hopefully this comes out legible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Data is current as of June 7, 2022. Stablecoin and Exchange communities are included although they may not fit perfectly in this list, but I found it interesting to know anyway. Hope some of you do too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t9z6491k1a491.png?width=1018&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=76552e18b21948f27238601fd8762d524c38d9cf\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t9z6491k1a491.png?width=1018&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=76552e18b21948f27238601fd8762d524c38d9cf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
