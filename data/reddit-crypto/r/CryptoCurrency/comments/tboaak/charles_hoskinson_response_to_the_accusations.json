Why people are so quick to believe their own bias and take slanderous claims as facts? How did Hoskinson hurt you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome to modern-day &amp;quot;journalism&amp;quot;, where if you&amp;#39;re unfortunate enough to be relevant, you get thrown into situations where you must spend hours of your day to pull out decade-old paperwork to address whatever accusations these leeches throw at you. If you fail to do so you get canceled, if you decide to waste your time and do pull out the paperwork, those leeches won&amp;#39;t even issue an apology and they still get the clickbait that they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For people wanting details about his degree, here ya go &amp;quot;At 18 an AS from front range community College in 2005. &amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1502097939669434378?s=20&amp;amp;t=1zqxKMiXKZcYZQS9pzw6Wg\"&gt;https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1502097939669434378?s=20&amp;amp;t=1zqxKMiXKZcYZQS9pzw6Wg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:\nOkay. People have mentioned that Solana thing was widely discussed here. I admit I based this assumption on few comments by people who were shitting on Hoskinson while seemingly being all fine with Solana. In retrospect, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said anything about Solana. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my point was, that lies about the total supply of tokens is something that is directly related to the blockchain of Sol, while this case doesn&amp;#39;t have much to do with Cardano.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I understand that I&amp;#39;m coming off as hypocritical here myself. And I&amp;#39;m sorry for that. But I just wanted to put these things into perspective when it comes to this cancel culture of this sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
