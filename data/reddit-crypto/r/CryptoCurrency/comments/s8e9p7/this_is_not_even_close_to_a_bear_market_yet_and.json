We&amp;#39;ve seen as much as -41% being wiped off the market in 2017 in a matter of weeks, yet the bull run kept continuing for months. It is not unrealistic to expect the same thing could happen now in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Comparing the May correction to the current one&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5ks3gv1qtsc81.jpg?width=1247&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0fbf56939bbe923c429c47518b6f608fe18a7ebb\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5ks3gv1qtsc81.jpg?width=1247&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0fbf56939bbe923c429c47518b6f608fe18a7ebb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has also hit a pretty significant support level and is refusing to go below it. This is the same support level that Bitcoin held in late September before hitting a new all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bearish price action we&amp;#39;re seeing is still nothing compared to what happened from May - July.  In June/July almost everyone was calling for a bear market, but Bitcoin still recovered within a few months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Hash rate shows market is undervalued rather than overvalued&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q3oxrse2ysc81.png?width=1273&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f764e0eea23cb0b849bbe263a3456f9ec3d57033\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q3oxrse2ysc81.png?width=1273&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f764e0eea23cb0b849bbe263a3456f9ec3d57033&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a bear market usually comes when the entire market is overvalued, which seems far from the truth considering Bitcoin hit a new hash rate high. If Bitcoin was overvalued, hash rates reaching new highs would be completely irrational as Bitcoin is not cheap to mine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;: There is still hope in the market because there&amp;#39;s still a high likelihood of the market bouncing back like it did in July and September. A -42% loss over a 2 month period is more of a correction than a bear market, and the metrics also show only one thing, and that is we are still far from a bear market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
