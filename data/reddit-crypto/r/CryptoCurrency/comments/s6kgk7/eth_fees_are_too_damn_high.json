And I&amp;#39;m sorry to say this, but I think that with ETH 2.0, the fees will also be incredibly expensive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the real world, people aren’t used to paying that much for everyday transactions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you even start researching and trading ETH if you are from some country where salary is less than the fee that we need to pay?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vision of the crypto future should be cheap, nobody wants to pay a few hundred to enjoy that freedom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
