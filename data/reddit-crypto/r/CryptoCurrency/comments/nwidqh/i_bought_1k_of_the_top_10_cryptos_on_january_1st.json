Although it narrowed the gap a bit this month, the 2019 portfolio is still the second best performing of the four, trailing the first place <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17\">2020 Top Ten Portfolio</a>.  Despite a rough May, <strong>the portfolio is up +459% since January 2019.</strong> </p>\n\n<h2>May Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts</h2>\n\n<p>Here are the May ups and downs for the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio:</p>\n\n<p>Ups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>EOS</strong> – up three places (#26–&gt;#23)</li>\n<li><strong>Tether</strong> – up two places (#5–&gt;#3)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Downs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BSV</strong> – down six places (#28–&gt;#34)</li>\n<li><strong>Tron</strong> – down four places (#20–&gt;#24)</li>\n<li><strong>Litecoin</strong> – down three places (#11–&gt;#14)</li>\n<li><strong>XRP</strong> – down three places (#4–&gt;#7)</li>\n<li><strong>Bitcoin Cash</strong> – down three places and out of the Top Ten (#10–&gt;#13)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4b6qz4b28e471.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=250877e8c882e666a5acb13702fb02f0493d10e2\"> 2019 Top Ten Rank - BCH drops out, now 60&#37; have fallen out of the Top Ten </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:</strong> After twenty-nine months, 60% of the cryptos that <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/\">started in the Top Ten in January 2019</a>  have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl83mI69nX4\">pushed</a> out.  <strong>EOS</strong>, <strong>Litecoin, BSV, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash,</strong> and <strong>Tron</strong> have been replaced by <strong>Binance Coin, Doge, Cardano, UNI, USDC,</strong> and <strong>Polkadot.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>BSV</strong> is the only one of the 2019 Top Ten cryptos that have dropped out of the Top <em>Thirty</em>. </p>\n\n<h2>May Winners and Losers</h2>\n\n<p><strong><em>May Winners</em></strong> – For the first time in a long time, <strong>Tether</strong>. Second place goes to <strong>EOS</strong>, which finished the month down just -3%. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>May Losers</em></strong> –  <strong>BSV</strong> was pummeled this month, losing nearly half of its value, down -46%.  <strong>Tron</strong>  is the second worst performer of May, down -41%.</p>\n\n<h2>Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers</h2>\n\n<p>Which crypto holds the most wins or losses over the life of the project?  Here’s a snapshot of the winners and losers over the first twenty-nine months of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ly8f1nh1be471.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a39811e5e582b0878dba940c501f7bab3ccac2c2\"> 2019 Top Ten Ws and Ls </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tether</strong> still has the greatest number of monthly victories (8) followed by <strong>BTC</strong> with five. In other words, 28% of the time (eight times out of twenty nine months) every crypto in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio has finished the month in the red. </p>\n\n<p>While every crypto has won at least one month since January 2019, <strong>EOS</strong> is the only crypto without a monthly loss in the 2019 Top Ten Experiment.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Update –  ETH has doubled BTC returns, all cryptos well in the green, BSV worst performing</h2>\n\n<p>Even though it fell -10% in May, <strong>Ethereum</strong> pulled further ahead of second place <strong>BTC</strong> this month. <strong>ETH’s</strong> ROI is more than double that of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> since the beginning of the 2019 Experiment.</p>\n\n<p>And that $100 investment into first place <strong>ETH</strong> on <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/\">January 1st, 2019</a>?  It’s currently worth $1,976.</p>\n\n<p>After twenty-nine months, 100% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. Not counting stablecoin <strong>Tether</strong>, the worst performing crypto is <strong>BSV</strong>, which is still up +85%.  Compare that to the ROI of the S&amp;P (more on that below).</p>\n\n<p>Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up an impressive +459%, it is still second place behind the best performing of the four Experiments: the 2020 Top Ten is up <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17\">+630%</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2r1oe7l7be471.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54390f0ddd35721f07fac487f05b8297f831a930\"> Total Market cap +1190&#37; since Jan 2019 </a></p>\n\n<p>The entire cryptocurrency sector is up +1190% since <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/\">January 2019</a>.  That’s still well behind first place <strong>ETH</strong> (+1,826%) but much better than the rest of the cryptos (including second place <strong>Bitcoin’s</strong> +873%) and much better than the Top Ten approach.</p>\n\n<p>After reaching <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28\">$2T last month</a>, the total market cap lost $570 billion in May.  The seven month streak of month-ending total market cap record highs was broken this month as the total market cap returned to a level last seen in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27\">March</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Bitcoin Dominance:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y87spptabe471.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23813a694cc8c9844be00a36105147a571ba5b1d\"> BitDom reached another 2019 Top Ten Experiment low in May</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>BitDom</strong> continued to drop in May, setting another low point in the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment.  For context, the table above shows the progression over the last twenty-nine months with <strong>BTC</strong> domination ranging between 42%-70%.  </p>\n\n<p>If you’re curious as to what happened last time <strong>Bitcoin Dominance</strong> fell into the low 40s and 30s, check out the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41\">2018 Top Ten Experiment</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h9nr2vyebe471.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2abc05f405a6b06f0b51efe4da88ed77bf1aee98\"> 2019 Top Ten Portfolio ROI </a></p>\n\n<p>The 2019 Top Ten Cryptos Portfolio lost $1933 in May.  After twenty-nine months the value of the initial $1000 investment is <strong>$5,594</strong>, up +459%. This breaks a six month streak of record returns for the 2019 Portfolio and the ROI has dropped back to where it was in March 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table summarizing the monthly ROI over the life of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund experiment, which provides a pretty good sense of the journey to this point:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x2p16s4hbe471.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf782f59e2da902127d32308dbd8272c1fc71215\"> 2019 Top Ten ROI Summary </a></p>\n\n<p>Almost completely green, but there have been some very significant dips.  For example, a little over <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15/\">one year ago</a> the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio was returning only +6%. </p>\n\n<p>At +459%, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is the second best performing <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/\">out of the four Experiments</a>.  First place is the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17\">2020 group</a>, up +630% as of this report.  </p>\n\n<h2>Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put them all together now:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41\">2018 Top Ten Experiment</a>: up +26% (total value $1,264)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-29\">2019 Top Ten Experiment</a>: up +459% (total value $5,594)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17\">2020 Top Ten Experiment</a>: up +630% (total value $7,300)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5\">2021 Top Ten Experiment</a>: up +281% (total value $3,809)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom <em>bottom</em> line: </p>\n\n<p><strong>After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,</strong> the combined portfolios are worth <strong>$17,967</strong> ($1,264 + $5,594 + $7,300 + $3,809).</p>\n\n<p><strong>That’s up +349%</strong> on the combined portfolio.  It’s a big drop from last month, but looking at the big picture, the combined portfolios are back to where they were two months ago in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28\">March</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/afwwfnujbe471.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=586c7e8af9c40620bff221e88fa04eddf30772e7\"> Combined +349&#37; ROI of all four Experiments </a></p>\n\n<p>In summary: <strong><em>That’s an +349% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Top Ten Index vs. Top Five Index</h2>\n\n<p>Inspired by a suggestion from one of our blog readers, let’s take a look at how the 2019 Top Ten approach would compare to a hypothetical Top Five Index.</p>\n\n<p>A Top Five 2019 Index would mean investing $200 into <strong>BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH,</strong> and <strong>EOS.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zy4y97znbe471.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8a59ac317f19822b9c0f1c60d1b09fdd6dab80c\"> An alternate reality: what if it had been the Top Five? </a></p>\n\n<p>After twenty-nine months, a Top Five Index would be worth <strong>$7,852</strong>, returning <strong>685%</strong>. That’s compared to the <strong>$5,594</strong> (<strong>+459%</strong>) of the 2019 Top Ten. </p>\n\n<p>Once again, it is very clear that going with the five largest caps on January 1st, 2019 would have been the much better approach.</p>\n\n<p>Alright, that’s crypto.  How does crypto compare to the stock market?</p>\n\n<h2>Comparison to S&amp;P 500:</h2>\n\n<p>I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.  Although only adding 1% in May, it was enough for another all time high for the S&amp;P:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9eafqhpube471.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb6cffd580eea74a923a4ce9be2990f59f6395e\">Month S&amp;P levels since Jan. 2019</a></p>\n\n<p>Since the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 68% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto a little over two years ago would be worth $1,680 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 in January 2019. </p>\n\n<p>Even though an extremely solid return for traditional markets, that +67% return is nearly <em>four hundred percentage points behind</em> the return of the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio over the same time period.</p>\n\n<p>But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&amp;P 500? It would yield the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1570 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1680 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1300 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1120 today</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom <em>bottom</em> line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: </p>\n\n<p><strong>After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,670</strong> ($1,570 + $1,680 + $1,300 + $1,120)</p>\n\n<p>That is up <strong>+42%</strong> <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">since January 2018</a> compared to a <strong>+349%</strong> gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 307% <strong><em>in favor of crypto.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table providing an overview of the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/duiirbnjce471.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f52a00bfcc0d7543c130420f82b134c45f46ece\"> Crypto vs. S&amp;P: crypto still far, far ahead </a></p>\n\n<p>That’s an eight month streak and a 307% lead for crypto, about the same as a few months ago in March. </p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n<p>Despite its first all red month since September 2020, the 2019 Top Ten continues to produce impressive returns.  Stepping back and taking a long-term view on crypto is helpful, especially in down months.  Have we topped out for this cycle?  No one knows, but we should all have a better idea of where we are in the coming months.  Buckle up.</p>\n\n<p>To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate this strange and exciting crypto landscape. </p>\n\n<p>Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects tracking the Top Ten cryptos as of <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41\">January 1st, 2018</a> (the OG experiment), <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17\">January 1st, 2020</a>, and most recently, <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5\">January 1st, 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, buckle up, and enjoy the ride. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
