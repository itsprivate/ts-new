The SEC will respond to tips that are submitted, especially if they receive several of them. For crypto to mature, regulators need to step in and crack the whip where there are instances of malpractice. Coinbase claims to advance the prominence and mission of crypto. Insider trading hurts everyone involved in the space. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I encourage those that have information to submit a tip.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
