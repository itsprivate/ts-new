Yeah you heard that right. I had several accounts because I was degenerate back then, and obviously still tarded today.</p>\n\n<p>I did it because of bonuses, and free airdrops. Also Walton coin was new and I had to drop my pants for it because everything new that got listed on binance had moon potential.   </p>\n\n<p>You know it, if it was newly listed on Binance , just like mini versions of coinbase rumors of XRP being listed, that crypto got instant credibility.   &quot;It got listed on binance!!!!...they don&#39;t list garbage!&quot;.     That&#39;s because everyone here was borderline schizo with no experience trading anything in their life whatsoever.   Including all veterans like myself .  They are all tarded.  They just have experience.</p>\n\n<p>Back to what I was saying.   BNB came out and obviously nobody would imagine that shit being 300+.      Everyone knows anything less than $10 was not transferable or tradable. Was $10 min.    So everyone was left with dust. </p>\n\n<p>I decided to sign onto all these accounts . And between the 2 old accounts I abandoned I&#39;m sitting on over 15 Binance tokens.  Along with an additional  $100s in dust on BTC and other things.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what the FK I was thinking.  A few months back I was short on money and didn&#39;t think once about my dust.    Now I&#39;m finding out my thousands of moons are actually worth about $0.10 ea???</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t tell you how relieved I am that Crypto is saving me and wife&#39;s ass this year.  We lost half our income because we are both SB owners.      </p>\n\n<p>Thank you everyone for supporting me and my shitposts over the years.  I had nothing to do.  I just enjoy expressing my thoughts and experiences here.</p>\n\n<p>And an even BIGGER 🤗 TO the mods/admins here for making moons possible.   I plan to F**K myself with these moons and help some people out.   My wife&#39;s aunt and uncle are 88 years old and struggling hard.  They need only a thousand to keep them a float.   My neighbor lady&#39;s electric chair needs repair and she&#39;s been fighting with insurance.   </p>\n\n<p>TIME TO PAy it forward!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
