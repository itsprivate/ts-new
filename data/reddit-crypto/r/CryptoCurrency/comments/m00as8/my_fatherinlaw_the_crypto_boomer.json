  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>It’s 2011.</strong> We’re having a nice Friday night dinner with my wife and her family. My father-in-law tells me about this new Internet coin he discovered and started “mining”. I’m an experienced software engineer, I brush it off as nonsense. What is this Boomer even saying to me. His wife laughs at him. I chuckle a bit too. My mind doesn’t give it a second thought. Bitcoin? meh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s 2014.</strong> My father-in-law invites me downstairs to his basement. It feels like hell. I have never felt such heat in my entire life. He shows me his new mining rigs with pride. He tells me he’s mining a new coin called &quot;Ethereum&quot; now. I pat him on the back and go back upstairs. I see my mother-in-law crying. She asks me if her husband has gone insane. He spent most of their savings on internet magic money.</p>\n\n<p>For the next 3 years, I hear her constantly ridiculing him. My mother-in-law’s jaw starts hurting from all the complaining and 24/7 bickering. My father-in-law shrugs it off every time and goes down to his basement to check on his rigs. It is hot like the sun down there. He&#39;s always kind of sweaty. I bring him a beer, and help him replace a broken fan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s 2017.</strong> Everyone I know is standing in line to have my father-in-law build a mining rig for them. Myself included. I buy my first Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>My mother-in-law’s jaw is still hurting, nowadays because she wakes up my father-in-law with a morning blowjob and fresh pancakes every day. He is hailed as an investing genius.</p>\n\n<p>My father-in-law shrugs and doesn’t say much. He sells some coins and pays off the mortgage. He builds rigs and teaches everyone in town who&#39;s interested on how to buy crypto. He tells them to “hodl”.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s 2019.</strong> My mother-in law is furious that my father in law didn’t sell all those stupid coins in order to buy that second house and the new Mercedes. She told him! And the idiot didn’t listen. The mortgage isn’t enough. I ask him if he regrets not selling it all - he says the only thing he regrets is marrying this woman, and goes back to his basement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s 2020.</strong> My father-in-law is getting morning blowjobs again. It’s some Russian model now. Her jaw doesn’t hurt, she’s pretty young and quite strong.</p>\n\n<p>Fucking guy.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: thanks for the comments guys. The story is real. I hate myself for not taking him seriously. Every time crypto ever comes up around me in conversation, I mention my father in law and how I should have been paying attention. Luckily, my wife doesn&#39;t really care since we&#39;re doing alright regardless :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
