People are profiting (I hope) from it so it&amp;#39;s no wonder every NFT news blows up. Although, right now all of these are purely out of speculations and NFT owners are basically hoping that the next sucker would want to pay more for their &lt;del&gt;trash&lt;/del&gt; stuff. Not only these NFTs have no current use some NFT projects don&amp;#39;t even have a future that can be look forward to, no promises, no roadmaps, nothing, aside from the hopes that the hype kicks in and it blows up in price. Sounds familiar right? Yeah, just like shitcoins/memecoins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may get a lot of flack for comparing NFTs and memecoins, but hear me out. Like I said in my first line, I&amp;#39;m not referring to the NFT tech as the same as memecoins, but the sense of it being a gambling space. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all the news focusing on the gains on NFTs and ridiculous prices it sells for and the risk being completely written off, no wonder more people are gambling in this space, but let&amp;#39;s not forget how majority of people would end up as bag holders. Just be careful if you plan to dabble on these NFT collections/projects. I really would just rather gamble on pokemon cards, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These NFTs are worse than shitcoins/memecoins gambling. Big name celebrities are in it for the fun &lt;sup&gt;or money laundering for fun like some people say&lt;/sup&gt;, but as retailers this is really a risky &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt; if you can&amp;#39;t get out on time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, unlike shitcoins/memecoins, NFT news are literally everywhere they even get mentioned in reputable news website. The exposure to the public mass and non-crypto people is ridiculously high. So more suckers would get sucked in in this blackhole.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
