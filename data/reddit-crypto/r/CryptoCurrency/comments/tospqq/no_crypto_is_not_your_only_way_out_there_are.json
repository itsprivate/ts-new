The only reason there is a chance to get wealthy of it with a relatively small investment, is a massive risk associated with it. Those are the facts. Do you really want THIS to be your &amp;quot;only way&amp;quot; to change your life? The ground you are building on is a pretty shaky one, mate.\nBut there is a great upside to this! It does not take much time to bet on crypto. Don&amp;#39;t chase every pump, inform your self periodically, invest what you can lose and you are golden. Now you can take time and actually work towards a goal you have some control over! Even if it seems hopeless and you fail, there is always something you will take from it. Constantly try to evolve in even the smallest things. I know how easy it is to resign yourself to your perceived &amp;quot;faith&amp;quot;, but by doing it you lose all the chances you never knew you had.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
