Essentially, give people access to more stable and substantial financial services, who would otherwise not have it. The impacts of this could be MASSIVE in countries that are often stricken with political turmoil and local fiat instability. This gives individual citizens, as well as bigger institutional investors a safer way to store their money if conflict or other variables threaten to devalue the local fiat.</p>\n\n<p>I addition to adding an option for more stable finances, they are also hoping to lay down a foundation for African nations to take advantage of. Imagine like an Ethereum network, but with a goal of letting underdeveloped nations have a chance to utilize the full capabilities of blockchain to improve the lives of their citizens. Once example was outlined in a deal between Cardano and the Ethiopian government.</p>\n\n<p>Ethiopia plans to use the Cardano blockchain to track student&#39;s progress in education, to determine how to improve said education. But just as with Ethereum and other similar networks, the possibilities are pretty unlimited. Something as simple as improving national education standards in Ethiopia would be a MASSIVE and EXPENSIVE undertaking that could never be afforded without the help of blockchain technology. And the impact of improving education could be astronomical. Seeing any movement like this makes me very happy, and very hopeful.</p>\n\n<p>My point is this:<br/>\nSure, crypto is a really fun hobby and money make for most of us. It is fun to watch the (green) charts, and read up on new projects. But lets not forget that the crypto-sphere is way more than an alternative to the stock market. Many of these projects are driven by extremely driven (possibly delusional sometimes) teams, with ambitions to make the world better for all of humankind. This is the reason I can handle the dips and red days without feeling too down about it; because I truly believe crypto and blockchain tech are the future. They will continue pushing the boundary, and could help solve some of our biggest humanitarian crises. So even if I lose some money on ambitious projects that didn&#39;t pan out, I feel good knowing that I am still an active part of bringing in a more positive future for humanity.</p>\n\n<p>Fiat currency has been ruined by corrupt government and greedy corporations; crypto will certainly have it&#39;s fair share of that in the near future. I just hope we don&#39;t lose sight of the possibilities it puts in the hands of the &quot;non-elite&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If you want to hear any more about the Ethiopia/education project, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/from-paper-to-cardano-blockchain-iohk-in-ethiopia\">here is a good article on it.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
