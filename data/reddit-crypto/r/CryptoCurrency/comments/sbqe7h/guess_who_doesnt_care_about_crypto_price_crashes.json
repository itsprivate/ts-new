Major investors like VC and private equity funds, put their money into projects with a roughly five year time horizon (when they have to pay back their investors.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally billions of dollars have flowed into the crypto markets in January, 2022 alone. Temporary price movements have little to no effect on these investor decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the old sports saying goes, hockey players skate to where the puck will be, not where it is now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other trends point in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More and more banks are going to offer crypto trading services (watch out for those fees) according to industry stalwart American Banker (&lt;a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics\"&gt;https://www.americanbanker.com/list/7-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2022-from-crypto-banking-to-biometrics&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They do this because they project continued demand for these services, which requires them to spend money on infrastructure, marketing, It teams, to make it happen. As slow as banks generally move, the fact they are offering these services is a longer-term plus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still not enough positive momentum?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider which Blockchain/web 3.0/tokenization projects are actually making services better, faster, or cheaper (or will relatively soon.) The tech adoption curve starts out slow, but eventually sweeps upwards over time (no one knows how long it will take until there&amp;#39;s mass adoption.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crashes like this shake out weak projects, get-rich-quick traders (they&amp;#39;ll be back when green days return, no doubt), and other fad chasers. That doesn&amp;#39;t change the longer-term trajectory of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
