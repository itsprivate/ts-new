I want to reiterate that not all of them are like this, but the Venn diagram of ADA fans and neck beards, who start discussions about the age of consent in japan, looks like the Mastercard logo. Those guys are also extremely idealistic and are often more interested in a perfect theoretical platonic ideal of a blockchain than the real thing.&lt;br/&gt;\nThey do not care about the price, they do not care about the speed of Cardano. As long as Charles Hoskinson makes videos, they will buy ADA every week and stake all of it forever. And lets face it, Charles will never stop making videos.&lt;br/&gt;\nDon&amp;#39;t get me wrong, Cardano can become a formidable blockchain for sure, but I also think that ADA will stay in the top 10 even if it literally stops working for years, as long as Charles makes videos about how everything is proceeding according to plan. That&amp;#39;s the reason why I have some Cardano in my Portfolio and maybe you should too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
