  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am making this post for one reason. To stop newbies who don&#39;t know about IOTA history from getting scammed by the IOTA ads from Linus Naumann who is a MOD of official IOTA sub.</p>\n\n<p>Look at <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p46tqq/a_future_day_with_iota/\">this most recent post</a> from Linus Naumann.</p>\n\n<p>You can look at every post in this sub made by him.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as he makes these advertisement posts for IOTA, it gets brigaded within just a few minutes to hot with upvotes and awards for a coin which is pretty much dead and almost nobody cares about.</p>\n\n<p>If you write any critical comment then it will get instantly downvoted to hide them by the IOTA brigaders who come here with him. Every reply from Linus gets instant 5-10 upvotes.</p>\n\n<p>This is nothing new for IOTA foundation. They play nice to shill their shitcoin but if you ask tough questions or disagree they will attack or try to silence you.</p>\n\n<p>Linus Naumann probably gets paid by IOTA foundation to make these IOTA shill posts in this sub full of lies, empty hype and false promises.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/l74il1/does_anyone_else_find_the_new_iota_underwhelming/\">this post</a> from <a href=\"/r/Iota\">r/Iota</a>. Someone who invested in this scam is asking a critical question and see how the IOTA sub MOD shuts that person down in the top comment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A short backstory for people who don&#39;t know about the history of IOTA.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 2017 during bull market, IOTA started doing heavy marketing with fake partnership announcements with Microsoft etc.</p>\n\n<p>They also kept making a series of overhyped posts in the IOTA blog just like Linus is making here without even having a working product just to pump the price during bull market. These fake announcements and false hype caused a lot of retail traders to get rekt last time.</p>\n\n<p>Eric Wall, CIO of the Nordic cryptocurrency investment firm Arcane Assets who researched the project described the project as “the worst coin to have gotten as high as it did. They’re pushing the boundaries of the fake-it-till-you-make-it approach to the extreme.” </p>\n\n<p>IOTA only pumped from empty marketing hype and announcements. During the following bear market there wasn&#39;t any serious development till the current bull market and now the marketing train is back with brigading tactics but still no working product. That&#39;s why nobody takes it seriously anymore and it&#39;s ranked below SHIB.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IOTA foundation harrasses and attacks people for criticizing them</strong></p>\n\n<p>The MIT Tech Review ran a scathing review of the IOTA protocol’s insecurities 4 years ago. The founders constantly harrassed and attacked the person who wrote that review.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, IOTA Foundation became known for scandalous emails between IOTA Foundation co-founder David Sonstebo and Neha Narula of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the IOTA community earned a reputation for routinely harassing women security experts, like Open Privacy founder Sarah Jamie Lewis, who found flaws in IOTA research.</p>\n\n<p>They also harrass people on social media and try to mass report and ban their accounts for criticizing the project.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/faced-with-criticism-iota-fans-try-to-bully-growing-list-of-detractors/\">https://news.bitcoin.com/faced-with-criticism-iota-fans-try-to-bully-growing-list-of-detractors/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>IOTA is a centralized scam without working product, gets repeatedly hacked and founders fight over tokens</strong></p>\n\n<p>IOTA foundation since the beginning has been using single controlling node called coordinator. The coordinator is authority node operated by the IOTA foundation and it&#39;s a single point of failure for the IOTA network, which makes the network centralized.</p>\n\n<p>IOTA has suffered attack after attack and network outages as a result of bugs in the coordinator and it is proven to be insecure to DDos attacks. IOTA first used a custom made hash function which was broken from the start and let you forge transactions.</p>\n\n<p>Last year the coordinator had outage for 20 days after their wallet got hacked. The network did not process any transactions during that time. Private keys of users and associated IOTA tokens worth around two million dollars got stolen.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/iota-being-shut-off-is-the-latest-chapter-in-an-absurdist-history\">https://www.coindesk.com/iota-being-shut-off-is-the-latest-chapter-in-an-absurdist-history</a></p>\n\n<p>Just few weeks before this outage one of the founders Sergey Ivancheglo AKA Come-from-Beyond/CFB decided to quit the project and had a fight with other founder David Sonstebo over splitting the founders IOTA tokens.</p>\n\n<p>As they were fighting the third founder who is Dominik Schiener claimed that he “single-handedly conceived” the IOTA brand. It was a messy fight and they were all trying to claim the founders tokens for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Now since bull market is back IOTA is saying they are doing tests without coordinator. Thats the DevNet testnet. IOTA said the same thing in May 2019. Quote from founder David Sonstebo in 2019:</p>\n\n<p>“We have been working towards the removal of the Coordinator since IOTA&#39;s inception. Now with the maturity and growth of the protocol, and the quality of our research team, we are bringing that promise to fruition.”</p>\n\n<p>Guess what? It didn&#39;t come to fruition. Another false promise. Now IOTA foundation is claiming they have a new solution to replace coordinator. IOTA is full of claimed research and pilots but no working product and there are no clients using the protocol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will IOTA ever work?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have no idea. I would say not because of how founders behaved in the past and repeated false promotions and announcements. Even if it did there are million question marks from the code to security of network.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if Satoshi hyped Bitcoin in 2000 without any idea how to solve BGP but he took money from investors with false hopes? Then if Satoshi was a group of people and they all started fighting over the money?</p>\n\n<p>Satoshi simply gave us Bitcoin and left. Now we have all these selfish scammers doing empty social hype for projects without even working product for over 6 years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>P.S. I will link tweets from Sarah Jamie Lewis and CFB in comments since twitter links are blocked in posts</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> If you observe in the comments almost everyone attacking this post in comments gets their comments immediately upvoted with 5-10 upvotes and critical comments get immediately buried. If I reply, it&#39;s immediately buried. Classic IOTA mob behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t care about their mass downvotes. In a time of deceit, speaking the truth is a revolutionary act.</p>\n\n<p>They can brigade all they want. People need to know the truth about IOTA and who is this Linus making IOTA shill posts full of lies and false promises everyday.</p>\n\n<p>Even redditor for 1 hour accounts are here 😂. Imagine if these guys spent this much effort on development as social engineering.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
