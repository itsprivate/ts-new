Its 14 days or something for Luna, 21 days on other chains.. and this period is enough for your coin to lose 99% of its value when an onchain event plays out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent staking unlock period risk, you can go for liquid staking but that has its own risks like smart contract risks and trust in a third party app and code. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the present scenario, if you had bought Luna at a higher level and staked it, you are shit out of luck. If you had not staked it, you could have exited at a much higher level. Stakers are most likely going to lose all the value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
