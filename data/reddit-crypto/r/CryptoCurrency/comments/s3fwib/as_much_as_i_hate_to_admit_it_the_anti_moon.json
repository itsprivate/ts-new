I sort by New due to wanting to read and comment on brand new post and I have now seen this  post about Kim kardashian and Floyd Maywether getting sued over some crypto scam posted Dozens of times if not hundreds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to state up front that I am in favor of moon farming but feel like a little bit of effort should be put in, not just constantly posting news articles that have already been posted. I am not asking for much, just a quick search to see if its been posted ten times in the last hour already. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a solution to this? Perhaps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I dont have any answers or the power to make any changes on this sub, I just wanted to let you guys know that Kim and Floyd are getting sued and its crypto related.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that everybody knows this, please stop posting the same articles over and over and I will give every post after mine that is not a news article an award until I run out of my Reddit coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for attending my Rant, and may you be blessed with awards and moons in this difficult time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ve been awarding every new post, but I had to skip the anti ALGO post because I&amp;#39;m pro ALGO and Silvio would get mad at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
