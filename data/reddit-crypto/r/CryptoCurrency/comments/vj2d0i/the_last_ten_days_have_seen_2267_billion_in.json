The large wick to 17.6k had indeed caused a ton of damage and a lot of people to actually sell. The realized losses, meaning actual losses after people sell, have reached about $22.67 billion and is likely even over $23 billion as we are speaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a bottom signal? No, definitely not but this just shows how brutal this crash has been so far you can very well argue that this has been worse than 2018 and makes the 2021 may correction look like literally nothing. And in this environment it is definitely remarkable how many are still here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We may get to $40b realized losses or more. But all that matters is that you don&amp;#39;t get caught by paper hands and sell yourself. Of course we very likely won&amp;#39;t hit a new ATH this year. But as Crypto has shows in the past that patience is key.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
