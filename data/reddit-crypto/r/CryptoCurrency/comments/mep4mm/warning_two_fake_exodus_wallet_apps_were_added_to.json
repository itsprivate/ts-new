If you don&#39;t feel comfortable downloading the apps in order to rate them, you can mark the legitimate reviews as &quot;helpful&quot; by clicking the thumbs up icon. You can also report the app without downloading it first. </p>\n\n<p>The fake Daedalus Wallet app wasn&#39;t removed from the Google Play Store until there were multiple posts made to spread awareness of the scam and to encourage others to report it. I&#39;m asking you to do the same.</p>\n\n<h1>How to protect yourself:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you&#39;ve downloaded the app and provided your seed phrase or deposited crypto into the wallet, see if you can withdraw your funds to a wallet that you control ASAP.</li>\n<li>If you&#39;ve downloaded either app, uninstall it immediately and run an antivirus scan to be safe (Malwarebytes has a free mobile app, but feel free to use the antivirus of your choice.)</li>\n<li>If you are looking for a mobile wallet app, always be sure to check the reviews, number of downloads, and developer information. Download directly from the official website if possible. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Stay safe and be sure to protect your recovery phrase! Remember: Any wallet that requires you to type in your recovery phrase is unsafe at best and a scam at worst.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
