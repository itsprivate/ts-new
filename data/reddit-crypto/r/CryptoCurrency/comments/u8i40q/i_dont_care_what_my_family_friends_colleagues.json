Who cares?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is up to us if we want to educate people who want to learn, who are interested in cryptocurrencies and their potential. There is absolutely no need to convince people, even if they are our closest ones, who reject the crypto right from the start and do not want to learn anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My experience with my friends: they laughed, after a while everyone seeks advice from me because they all invested money in cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who cares honestly. Spending your free time by doing research, learning and investing is not wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or by Satoshi quote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t believe me or don&amp;#39;t get it, I don&amp;#39;t have time to try to convince you, sorry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep investing, keep trading, keep doing what you think it is the best for you. If people telling you otherwise is bothering you, you may never reach your goal. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
