No I’m not investing significantly large amounts of money, but I am allocating a fair percentage of my income into crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because buying a house, owning some property, or even renting a place has seen prices increase substantially; especially here in Canada, where housing prices jumped over 26% last year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not investing on a whim; I take the time to learn the fundamentals and do my research. I buy solid crypto that I personally believe in for the long term. I’m fine waiting, practicing patience, and accumulating over time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t expect to become rich, and I know damn well I won’t wakeup a millionaire one day. However, I have faith and am optimistic about the future of some projects I hold, like CRO and ALGO for example. (ETH and BTC too, of course). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good things come to those who wait. May we all prosper!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little edit: the feedback I’m receiving is exactly why I love this community so much, thank you all for the kind words! I genuinely hope you all find financial freedom one day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
