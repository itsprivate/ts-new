If you do your own DD, which is exactly why I&#39;m making this post because that&#39;s what I think you should do, you will figure out that Silvio Micali is a genius and clearly a front runner in the sustainable DeFi-Crypto market. I am not going to post everything that I&#39;ve researched, but I will have <a href=\"https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases\">this</a> here in order to give you all the option to read on their site about themselves. They have a transparency page you can check out if you want to see the wallets behind this. It&#39;s a fixed supply and for some reason the market cap is sitting at about 2-3 billion when it&#39;s has a multitude of use cases and is CARBON NEGATIVE AS OF 2021. People want to talk about Doge for Green currency but it&#39;s no comparison if you want to read about it <a href=\"https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/05/forget-dogecoin-smart-contracts-this-proof-of-stake-green-coin-is-better/\">here</a>. To me that last one is pretty significant. Again, do your own DD, but if Doge and those other Shitcoins can hit 40 Bil in Cap then I don&#39;t see why Algo shouldn&#39;t be at least $10 right now, especially since they HAVE A SECURE AND WORKING APP ON BOTH IOS AND GOOGLE?!?!?!? They literally give you free Algo just for having at least 1 in your wallet, and on their own wallet they give you every single last reward unlike coinbase and other exchanges that take a percentage of your rewards. </p>\n\n<p>Ps. I&#39;m not a bag holder at 1.5 trying to shill you a coin, I just keep doing more research on this project and have become convinced it is the real deal among a sea of shit and I want more people to do some research on it and give me their opinions</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
