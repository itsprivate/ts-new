I was pretty confident he was looking to make money from me and I tried to make it obvious up front. But, he persisted and tried to sell me that he has a way of getting me 25% weekly returns <strong>minimum</strong>. How could I pass that up!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/khw5nhc69sp61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa9111fd17863cf75b99088e599c6097b28435dd\">Wow! 25&#37; weekly!</a></p>\n\n<p>He linked me to some FOREX trading site and convinced me to sign up. So, I signed up as &quot;Michael Scott&quot;. He told me he would mirror the same trades he makes himself on my account... I just need to link him to my account to get started.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6zyvfnqc9sp61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8bf360b99cbfb2b378540eb9abef2c784571cf2\">https://preview.redd.it/6zyvfnqc9sp61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8bf360b99cbfb2b378540eb9abef2c784571cf2</a></p>\n\n<p>We go on. I feign having trouble with the site and attempt to see if he&#39;ll let me send him money directly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u96rcudb9sp61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c98e5e06f838fcead14939db3fa297b8317fbf6\">https://preview.redd.it/u96rcudb9sp61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c98e5e06f838fcead14939db3fa297b8317fbf6</a></p>\n\n<p>Since I refuse to send my ID, he sends me to a new site. This site is even less legit than the first. I decide to upload he profile picture as my verification photo... and soon after he stops talking to me. Feels like I lost a friend.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oyjyryu99sp61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5647bdbb3edca0583bf72b4052cfba5cea763f02\">https://preview.redd.it/oyjyryu99sp61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5647bdbb3edca0583bf72b4052cfba5cea763f02</a></p>\n\n<p>This is just a reminder that if anyone has a bot or a trading strategy that produces ungodly returns, they are 99% likely to be a scam. If they can produce 25% returns weekly reliably, they don&#39;t need your business.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
