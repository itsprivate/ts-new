The boss was a jerk, the colleagues were bad people. The company itself is bad.  </p>\n\n<p>After a year when I found a new job I quit right away without thinking and I can tell you that I now work in a great company with a solid salary for the standard of living in the country where I live. So nothing special, but at least I don&#39;t have to cope with &quot;mental terror&quot; anymore and the team I work with is full with amazing people. </p>\n\n<p>I want to insure/secure myself, my family and my PRIDE with cryptocurrencies. I never want to be in a situation where I have to endure all kinds of situations again because I have no choice and I hope that crypto will help me in that.   </p>\n\n<p>We never know what life will bring us tomorrow, but one should always have a backup plan. My backup plan is crypto and that is my hope for a better future. </p>\n\n<p>If I can make a lot of money, great. If I fail, I have invested as much as I can lose and I will not fail financially. </p>\n\n<p>This is my backup plan, never again I will be hummiliated and take all kind of sh*t from bad people who are not at my level.
