One thing that has also held true is diminishing returns.   Every single cycle the top to top is SIGNIFICANTLY lower returns.   47x,17x and 3x roughly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given that we are going to get diminishing returns and still get bear markets of -70 or more,  does HODL truly make sense?  We’ve officially reached the cycle where the diminishing returns are so apparent that we breached previous ATH.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that the smartest strategy is to buy in the bear market and sell your whole stack in the bull run.   Obviously you won’t catch the top or bottom but it’s a better way to preserve your capital.   Will you be DCA’ing in the next bull run once/if we break 70k?   I just hate how taking profits it’s frowned in this community and ppl are encouraged to HODL which is a penny stock promoter scam tactic.  To each their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
