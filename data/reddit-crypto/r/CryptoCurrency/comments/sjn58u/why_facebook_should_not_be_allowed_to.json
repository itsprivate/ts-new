  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&amp;#39;s Facebook earnings report of 2021 Q4, this is what they disclosed about future earning projections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;We expect first quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $27-29 billion, which represents 3-11% year-over-year growth. We expect our year-over-year growth in the first quarter to be impacted by headwinds to both impression and price growth.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people&amp;#39;s time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories.&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;On the pricing side, we expect growth to be negatively impacted by a few factors:&lt;/code&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;First, we will lap a period in which Apple&amp;#39;s iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Second, we will lap a period of strong demand in the prior year and we&amp;#39;re hearing from advertisers that macroeconomic challenges like cost inflation and supply chain disruptions are impacting advertiser budgets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Finally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to be a headwind to year-over-year growth.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Apple&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Ask App not to track&amp;quot; feature has negatively affected Facebook&amp;#39;s ad revenue and ad campaigns as they can&amp;#39;t track these users anymore, steal their data and making money off of targeted ads more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as Zoomers are more into tik tok, reels based ads have lower monetization rate.So, what does Zucc do? Zucc is thinking about creating their own metaverse, kinda like Sandbox or Decentraland, but with actual VR and monetize it by playing ads(Like how people are buying lands in Sandbox and Mana to advertise their business) and stealing more data from users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is because, they realized, since they will not have a majority chunk of iphone users data which is always a big part of their revenue because majority of the United States use iphone and ad rates are better for Western countries rather than third world countries, Zucc realized he can&amp;#39;t control mobile devices anymore, hence he wants his own Matrix style Dystopian Metaverse with targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook has literally shaped how modern society is. The harm what facebook has done and is continuing to due on many fronts to the population is irreversible. Facebook should not be allowed to succeed in it&amp;#39;s Metaverse plans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, FUCK FACEBOOK!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit - Some more news to add.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook loses daily users for first time ever, ad growth slows - Link -&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://business-standard.com/article/technology/facebook-loses-daily-users-for-first-time-ever-ad-growth-slows-122020300292_1.html\"&gt;business-standard.com/article/technology/facebook-loses-daily-users-for-first-time-ever-ad-growth-slows-122020300292_1.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Facebook Q4 2021 Earnings Report - &lt;a href=\"https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2022/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Results/default.aspx\"&gt;https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2022/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Results/default.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
