That&amp;#39;s when you know we are truely in some bearish sentiment. But a bearish sentiment is probably the best thing, as the bears become very overconfident that everything is under control but in Crypto nothing every is in anyone&amp;#39;s hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also looking at the history the past big bull runs started after everyone was not even thinking about a pump but just about a further dumb. One thing to akwys remember is that a bear run only happens when we can not imagine it going down any day soon and a bulk run happens when we can not imagine it going up any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
