I invested in Crypto, but I invested in crypto with MY OWN MONEY, if it goes to zero, it&amp;#39;s my bad, not hers. She works and earns her money too, buys her shoes and dresses and I don&amp;#39;t stick my nose in, it&amp;#39;s her money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as our house expenses are covered where each one pays half of them, then the spare money we can do whatever we want because it&amp;#39;s our money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For context, I live in Portugal (Europe), for cultural reasons, things might work differently in your country. Not saying I&amp;#39;m right and you are wrong, just putting different lifestyles in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does it work at your place? Does your family have a say in your personal expenses?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
