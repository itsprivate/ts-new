But a few minutes ago one of these &amp;quot;3 posts and 50 comments a day exactly&amp;quot; moon farmers on here made a pseudo-wholesome post saying that nobody is too poor to buy crypto and &amp;quot;Crypto is for everyone regardless how poor or wealthy they are&amp;quot;. And of course you guys are upvoting this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s garbage. &lt;a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-many-are-rich-and-how-many-are-poor/\"&gt;A billion people have less than 1 USD a day&lt;/a&gt;. Those that have a bit more than that are not exactly rich either. There are millions of homeless people around the world, many of which don&amp;#39;t have access to the internet to buy crypto - and none of which have money to do so. There are so, so many people in the world who cannot afford to buy enough food, pay rent, or other important commodities, and many more who can barely do so but have nothing left in their bank account at the end of the month. &lt;strong&gt;Those people are definitely too poor to buy crypto&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, if you get by and only have a few bucks each month to gamble away, you&amp;#39;re not too poor to buy crypto, you can just buy small amounts and it&amp;#39;s fine. But saying &amp;quot;Nobody is “too poor” to invest&amp;quot;, as one of the commenters did, is just arrogant - and blatantly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: please stop telling me that this is also true for other investments. Of course it is. My point is that people like to pretend while this is true for other investments, the barrier is so low for crypto that it isn&amp;#39;t true for crypto. I&amp;#39;m not saying crypto is more exclusive than other investments, I&amp;#39;m saying it isn&amp;#39;t really more inclusive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
