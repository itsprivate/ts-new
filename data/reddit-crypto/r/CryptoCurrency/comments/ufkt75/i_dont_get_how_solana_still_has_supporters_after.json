But what use is this ultra high TPS if half of the time I can’t even use the network cause of its awful downtime?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even their own freaking CEO notoriously said “it doesn’t matter if the network crashes”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the CEO of a platform or service doesn’t trust its performance, then why tf should I trust it? It just makes no sense how this coin is still at number 6 in rank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, almost every chain on the market has suffered from downtime here and there but never to the extent that Solana did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would much rather stay where I am on Polygon right now. Transactions are just as fast and even cheaper and their ecosystem is WAY more superior with recent news about more than 19k dApps build on top of it.\nBut most importantly, its way more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And its not just Polygon. I just mentioned it cause its the platform I use the most. Literally any other platform right now is more reliable than Solana.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
