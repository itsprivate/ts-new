I had placed very low limit orders prior to this that have since been filled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I logged into my account after placing these low bids on the market a while back, I was amazed to see I had amassed 632,151 XRP tokens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s the heart-breaking bit. I naturally was mind-blown, so I tried to sell some of the XRP in the account then withdraw my profits from the exchange elsewhere, only to have the withdrawal declined and my account temporarily closed for 1 day siting a ‘violation of our terms of use’. I have done nothing wrong and simply set low limit orders that were filled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I contacted support asking why this has happened, they didn’t tell me why my account was restricted or what terms of use I had broken. After the 24 hours my account is back up, all the XRP is gone and I’m left with the cryptocurrency I had originally. I contact support again asking for my coins back, I get vague responses not related to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For proof of this happening:  &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/NSYsvqn\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/NSYsvqn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
