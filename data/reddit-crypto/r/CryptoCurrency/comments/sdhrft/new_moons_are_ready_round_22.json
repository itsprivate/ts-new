Every month, 50% of Moons burned are meant to be reintroduced in the following distribution, but because of a bug in the contract this has not been happening as expected. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have deployed an update to the smart contracts to fix the distributions going forward (it won’t apply to this current round but will apply to future rounds after this one). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those interested, here are the details from the team for what happened: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=\"https://testnet.redditspace.com/address/0x22037C488520DF547c2cd2AA0BE70517082BDA1C/contracts\"&gt;buggy Distributions Contract&lt;/a&gt; on lines 1705 - 1708, we are adding the Points totalSupply from the previous round to the number of Points claimed in the previous round.  If that total is less than the current Points totalSupply, then that means points were burned (less points exist now than were minted).  However, this code has a bug where it does not account for the Points issued to the SharedOwners.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is fixed in the &lt;a href=\"https://testnet.redditspace.com/address/0x255b868d0C13C45123085cb574218667433C7E4b/contracts\"&gt;updated Distributions Contract&lt;/a&gt; lines 1701 &amp;amp; 1747 by keeping track of the Points issued to the SharedOwners in the previous round, and including them in the count of total Points issued for the previous round.  This fix requires 1 distribution round to start working, so burned points will start being reintroduced in the Round 23 distribution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This distribution of Moons has been finalized, and Moons are being delivered to users with a registered Vault. Users who do not have a Vault yet will get their Moons when they create one through the Reddit app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This distribution is based on karma earned from 2021-12-22 to 2022-01-18. &lt;a href=\"https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/CryptoCurrency/round_22_finalized.csv\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the finalized list, with contribution scores signed by Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moons are &lt;a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\"&gt;r/CryptoCurrency&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s form of &lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/community-points\"&gt;Community Points&lt;/a&gt;, a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions to the subreddit, and they can be used on premium features in the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
