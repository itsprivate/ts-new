Getting into crypto during the euphoria of last Oct and Nov and then going through a pretty deep fire sale, bear, crash, whatever, it&amp;#39;s going to give you a real thick skin, especially if you&amp;#39;re young and new to investing in general or if you&amp;#39;re overleveraged. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagine it can be pretty daunting and disconcerting with all the FUD, rug-pulls, scams, and pump-and-dumps. But, don&amp;#39;t let that shit get to you, it&amp;#39;s just part of the crypto journey, and every failure is a lesson, albeit a sometimes painful and expensive one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can look at the bright side, though; you&amp;#39;re getting your first bear market out of the way. The next one will be a walk in the park for you. (they always suck, but they do get easier, and you learn how to make them work for you)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re new to the space: what&amp;#39;s one lesson you&amp;#39;ve learned?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a seasoned veteran: what&amp;#39;s one bit of advice you can offer?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
