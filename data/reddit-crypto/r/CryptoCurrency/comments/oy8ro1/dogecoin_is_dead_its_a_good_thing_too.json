And most of the investors have realized there are much better projects to invest in instead of doge which is why we are seeing most legit projects pump these last two weeks while doge stays stagnant. </p>\n\n<p>This does not mean doge will never go up again. I’m sure it will go up during the next bull run as almost all coins will. But I still think it’s a shit coin in comparison to other top tier coins out. </p>\n\n<p>Also this is my first ever post in this subreddit and it’s about my own personal experience. It’s not a damn moon farming post I’m actually surprised it’s gotten this much traction. I appreciate all the comments, especially the hate😂</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
