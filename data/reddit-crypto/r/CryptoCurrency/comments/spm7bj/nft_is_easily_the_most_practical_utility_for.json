  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFT is now the butt of jokes and its making crypto look bad.  There is finally  something that can show the world the capability of  blockchains and what crypto is capable off, and instead it is turn into a cash grab of JPEGs and weird antics.  It was kind of neat as a novelty but now not so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But NFT is so  much more and it deserves better. Lets change things by decoupling the JPEG from NFT. I will start first. Here is a random list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Land deeds and proof of ownership. The really cool thing about this is that it can even over time keep track of changes to the property.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is a recent Florida auction that was sold this way and attracted over 7,000 bidders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Medical records. Imagine your own medical NFT ledger that you can give access to and can deny at will. This includes tracking your access of your data for research/insurance/marketing.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;George Church has started a genome sequencing company called Nebula that is exploring this.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ever got to a new doctors office and filling a shit load of paper work, twice?  Well with NFT it could be just a simple access request.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IP/patents can be documented and verified so that there is no question who invented what.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m not just talking about selling the NFT as a patent but literaly to track work related to the patents. This is a huge issue when it comes time to say who invented what and who gets the patent. The latest controversy was with CRISPR.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;any type of ID can now be easily verified and difficult to fake - that means someone can&amp;#39;t just scan your driver license and make a clone of it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ticketmaster killer, you know what I mean here. And NFT tickets can easily be linked to special subevents like autographs, special access and what not.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Linking to real world assets to ensure authenticity. One I heard of recently is linking the odometer in cars and preventing people from turning it back.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Anything that requires  a real life contract.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;notary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the point is that its not something hypothetical; its real and  its probably one of the easiest way to increase use of cryptocurrency and blockchains.  So lets not do it any more damage by constantly linking JPEGS/digital arts to NFT because its so much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
