They did a great job of tracking funds from one wallet to over a dozen far-right groups including French neo-nazis, Daily Stormer, VDARE, and more. $250,000 went to Nick Fuentes who then appeared at Capitol Hill weeks later.  </p>\n\n<p>I took the Namecoin handle &quot;Pankkake&quot; identified by Chainalysis and found personal information associated with the account. Pankkake cropped up in Freenode (IRC) chatrooms back in 2013 where he often talked to Monero creator Fluffy Pony and other well-known crypto figures. Pankkake had some pretty ugly views on women, black people, Jewish people, and just about everything else.  </p>\n\n<p>I read through hours of chats and found a blog posted by the guy who once threatened to kill Andreas Antonopoulous, and saw Pankkake posting on that website with the same handle. That site profile linked to his old blog, which had been inactive since 2014 until the day before he sent the $500,000, December 8 2020.   </p>\n\n<p>The blog revealed his real name, Laurent Bechalier, and  hs last blog post was a suicide note.  </p>\n\n<p>The suicide note reads like a mixture of the Unabomber manifesto and Mein Kampf. It&#39;s pretty long, and he details reasons for killing himself that span the decline of western civilizaiton, COVID and Holocaust conspiracy theories, and the delay of the latest Fast and Furious movie. His blog also contained adult content and a fan site he made for a metal goregrind band.  </p>\n\n<p>There were a lot of moving parts to this story. <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/unmasking-deceased-programmer-donated-bitcoin-capitol-hill-rioters/\">Here&#39;s the article,</a> with links to Bachelier&#39;s blog and IRC chats, if anyone wants to check it out!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
