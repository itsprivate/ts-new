First, you probably won&amp;#39;t endear yourself to anyone unless they&amp;#39;re greedy, and second I feel like crypto isn&amp;#39;t that great a topic to talk about all the time, but that&amp;#39;s just me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall this is just a warning. I&amp;#39;ve had it happen to me, and I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of other people have as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep your crypto a secret unless people ask for it. Just go on with your life and do your thing and secretly keep earning that magic internet money we all love so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
