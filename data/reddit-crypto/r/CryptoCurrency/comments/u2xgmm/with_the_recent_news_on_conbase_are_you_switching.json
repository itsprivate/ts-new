So now that you know this information are you planning on changing exchanges if you were using conbase?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is probably going on with every major Centralized exchange due to the fact that people are greedy and will take advantage of any opportunity to make more money. what  options do we have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have some stuff on Conbase and am planning on moving it to a non-custodial wallet this week, I had planned to leave it in Conbase to be able to sell easily but with the way the past couple of months have gone I&amp;#39;m just going to hold it for a while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: are you ditching Conbase due to insider trading that has come to light?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
