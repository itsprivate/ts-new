He had some AliExpress coins that I ordered as well for myself so I was curious, faked interest and asked how much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had 100$ engraved in it (since the original price for 1 btc is not an amount you have in your pocket). The gentleman told me he mined it (LOL) and mined too much for this year and can’t cash it but he needs money for Christmas gifts for the family. He would give me the coin for 50$ all I have to do is to go to a Bitcoin ATM and insert this coin in it and show my face to the camera (he explained that the reason he can’t cash it because it stores the picture and the system remembers him and he hit his limit for 2021). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so entertained I kept talking with him and finally I told him I forgot don’t have any cash with me. It was definitely a hilarious experience but I hope he could not sell them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
