Here I was thinking that, if value took a downturn, it would be a relatively gradual taper and I would have time to exit. Nope. Also, if <em>I</em> were that <em>one person</em>, you better believe I <em>would</em> sell. <strong>Thank you</strong> <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a></p>\n\n<p>To those of you still in DOGE, who have made a nice profit: more power to you.
