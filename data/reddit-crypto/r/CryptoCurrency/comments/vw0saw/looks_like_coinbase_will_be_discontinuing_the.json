No more Amp at 2%, no more USDC at 1%, no more DAI at 1%, no more Ethereum at 1% and no more Bitcoin at 1.5%. From 4% rewards to 2% rewards to 0%. Honestly can say that the most enticing aspect of using Coinbase as an exchange and service was the reward program and ability to spend cryptocurrency easily. I’m quite disappointed but from a business perspective I understand not wanting to go under by simply trying to sustain their rewards program as this is probably one of their largest expenses. From 4% to 0% in a year. Was nice while it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
