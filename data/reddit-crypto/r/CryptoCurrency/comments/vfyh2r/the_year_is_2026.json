Despite falling over 90% from its ATH, Elon continues to shill Dogecoin as a valid form of currency. His tweets no longer seem to have an effect on the price of Dogecoin as most investors now see his long lived obsession as being out of touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Centralized exchanges now only able to offer rates around 1 - 2% after all the SEC regulations that were put in place to protect consumers after the 2022 crash.

For some this is true, and for others they just did a poor job taking profits and are content to wait it out until the next bull run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At least I learned some important lessons&amp;quot;.
