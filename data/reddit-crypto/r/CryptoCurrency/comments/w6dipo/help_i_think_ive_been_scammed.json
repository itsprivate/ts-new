I set up my trezor wallet and initiated the transfer of my coins. 2 days later, my BTC was in my wallet but not my ETH. I then went on this subreddit asking for help. Someone messaged me with these instructions about how to get the ETH onto my wallet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Link that I was given) \nClick on missing assets\nClick on the trezor wallet and connect manually\nThen click on the eth transaction to authenticate the transaction&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed the steps and then entered my seed recovery password and when I went back to my wallet, my BTC was gone and sent to a different address. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anyway to unsend that? I might be the dumbest person to ever walk the earth. It looked like a secure website omfg. Is there any action I can take to recover it? I’m freaking out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I’m so embarrassed and ashamed. I lost everything. I’m ruined. This shouldn’t come as a shock to anyone who’s more familiar with BTC, or has common sense. I fell for something that an elderly person with dementia would fall for. And I did it because I was so eager/anxious to resolve the issue that I didn’t use my head. Fuck my life I want to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
