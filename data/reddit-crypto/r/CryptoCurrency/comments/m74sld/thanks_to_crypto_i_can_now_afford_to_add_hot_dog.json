Those were the days!  The summer of 2017 was popping and thanks to my gains, I went from eating ramen straight out of the pack to using boiled water to soften the noodles.  Before my 2017 gains, my wife&#39;s boyfriend gained a lot of respect for me, and he even called me &quot;brah&quot; one day as he was picking up my wife for a hot date.  Man, I was on top of the world!</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to 2018, all my gains was gone.  Poof.  Overnight, I was back to eating ramen straight out of the pack.  I couldn&#39;t even afford the flavored ramen, just plain dry ramen with a generic label.  No brand names for me.  My wife&#39;s boyfriend went back to calling me Skid Mark instead of Regular Mark, and he never said &quot;brah&quot; to me ever again.  I was a loser.</p>\n\n<p>The bear market was rough.  The crypto winter seemed like it would never end.  But I was diamond hands!  I hodled my coins and waited patiently.  Then, it happened!  The crypto winter was over and the bulls were back!  Life handed me a second chance!  My wife&#39;s boyfriend is back to calling me Regular Mark, and I think he&#39;s gonna call me &quot;brah&quot; again one day.  I can&#39;t believe how lucky I am!</p>\n\n<p>To celebrate, I bought a pack of hot dogs and put hot dog slices in my ramen!  I still buy the non-flavored ramen cuz I want to save up and one day own a whole Satoshi.  But I believe in my dream!  And now my ramen tastes like boiled hot dog water, and I&#39;m happier than I&#39;ve ever been!</p>\n\n<p>Just remember, if you believe in yourself and you hodl, you can achieve anything!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
