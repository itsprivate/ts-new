There are “Beginner Resources” in the daily, but it is constantly overlooked and it needs to be pinned to the front page. Through this initiative, we can reduce spam and help newbies join the crypto word. Newbies need to know the most trustworthy exchanges, the importance of 2FA, and everything else that goes along with investing in cryptocurrency! Let’s help our growing community by providing much needed resources for all! Let’s uphold the great reputation of <a href=\"/r/Cryptocurrency\">r/Cryptocurrency</a> and give back to the community. We all know Reddit is the best source of information anyway!</p>\n\n<p><strong>tldr; I propose pinning to the front page a “Beginner’s Guide to Cryptos” that will address in detail everything a beginner will need to know to start investing.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
