Saw the ads on F1 and other big events. Saw the great earn rates which i have been using for months now to generate interest since in the EU the interest is negative. So after saving up for a long time and watching my bag increase i finally thought about a week ago, Lets Just get this obsidian card for the Sweet interest i Will get on my CRO since the earn rates on USDC were too bad. Now i Just found this out today and feel disgusted. How can a company actually see this as a great strategy Both long term and short term? Kris you did me dirty and many others. Now i know that in 170 days ill be home from you CDC. You Just ended your exchange for many. But well atleast you got your own F1 circuit and a Arena! Great enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
