And NFT&amp;#39;s with gaming utility will most likely stay. But seriously, don&amp;#39;t spend your hard earned crypto on shitty pictures that someone drew in a few hours. Most peole artificially inflate the price of these NFT&amp;#39;s by just buying their own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most likely a lot of NFT project creators will just ghost their own project, maybe even the networks hosting your images linked to the metadata that make up the NFT will be gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly dont understand why people spend thousands of dollars on a cartoon that can&amp;#39;t be used for anything else then an ugly profile picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NFT&amp;#39;s can be used for great things in the future, but honestly current usecases are idiotic to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
