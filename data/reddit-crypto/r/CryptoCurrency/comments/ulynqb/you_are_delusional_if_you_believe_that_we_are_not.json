And I am not talking about the last few weeks. Crypto is on a steady decline for &lt;strong&gt;7 MONTHS&lt;/strong&gt;, and people want to still argue that this isn&amp;#39;t a bear market?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By definition, a bull market occurs when securities are on the rise, while a bear market occurs when securities &lt;strong&gt;fall for a sustained period of time&lt;/strong&gt;. If 210 days of steady decline isn&amp;#39;t a sustained period of time, I don&amp;#39;t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I haven&amp;#39;t invested in the last few months for various reasons. The main one was that all altcoins were -70% down from ATH, while BTC was still at 40k. Now tell me what would happen if BTC reached 28k like it did last year? Altcoins would be most likely down -85%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rate hike, inflation, the Ukraine war and the stock market being in a bubble for almost 2 years now are just some other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when will bull market start again in my opinion? Sadly, I believe it will happen only after a market crash. There will be a nice reset, investing going back to normal and people buying the dips, potentially war being over or even getting inflation under control. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, no investor will ever go all-in with their money if there are so many risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
