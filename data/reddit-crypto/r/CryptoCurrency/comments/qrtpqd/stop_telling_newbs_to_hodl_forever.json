What is the worst thing that could happen by taking profits? You made some money, and if you choose maybe you can re-enter at a lower price, in turn making more money than the person who just hodled forever and never sold? Sure, either strategy could work just fine. But if you look at people who got rich from crypto, most of them bought during the bear market. Hodling from the peak all the way through a bear market doesn’t earn you more points. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Stop telling people what to do. Everyone’s financial situation is different.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
