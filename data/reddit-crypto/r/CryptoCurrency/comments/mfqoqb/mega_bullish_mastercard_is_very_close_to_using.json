Rumor is always more valuable than the news itself!</p>\n\n<p>We have 3 solid evidences:</p>\n\n<p>Evidence 1) Biser Dimitrov, Director, Blockchain Product Development &amp; Innovation at <strong>Mastercard</strong> is an <strong>expert</strong> Smart Contracts developer with <strong>Solidity</strong>/Go, Digital Assets origination, <strong>Ethereum.</strong> (Source: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/biserdimitrov\">LinkedIn</a>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/np2p54ir9zp61.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4921184782b7acc35ec48f88db185b2127cd046\">https://preview.redd.it/np2p54ir9zp61.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4921184782b7acc35ec48f88db185b2127cd046</a></p>\n\n<p>Biser Dimitrov was only hired by Mastercard in Apr 2020!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why would Mastercard hire a Solidity/Go expert, if they were not going to use Ethereum?</strong> Logical conclusion is that Mastercard is in fact going to use Ethereum!</p>\n\n<p>Evidence 2)</p>\n\n<p>Quite a few Mastercard Employees are learning Solidity/Ethereum in recent times. We just list a few examples here:</p>\n\n<p>i) <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/arijeet-chakravarty-068ba99\">Arijeet Chakravarty Consultant at Mastercard</a>, did a course on Solidity in March 2021.</p>\n\n<p>ii) <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashi-goyal-48b44422\">Rashi Goyal</a>, Director - Product Development | Blockchain/Crypto at Mastercard, completed a course on Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer&#39;s Guide Udemy Issued Mar 2020.</p>\n\n<p>This just shows that the employees themselves (who have more inside info than us outsiders) are very bullish on Ethereum, and are willing to spend time to upgrade themselves in this field. There has to be a reason, employees have so many courses to choose from, why choose Solidity?</p>\n\n<p>Evidence 3)</p>\n\n<p>Mastercard is <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/new-york-lead-software-engineer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,8_IC1132348_KO9,31.htm?rdserp=true&amp;jl=4036052168&amp;guid=000001787e5082a0a8afaee16149d5b6&amp;pos=101&amp;src=GD_JOB_AD&amp;t=ESR&amp;srs=EI_JOBS&amp;s=21&amp;ao=1157549\"><strong>hiring</strong> a Blockchain Lead Software Development Engineer on Glassdoor</a>, requiring the following skillset:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Design and implementation of innovative capabilities leveraging experience with a blockchain network such as <strong>Ethereum</strong> and a Smart Contract language such as <strong>Solidity</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Technically, yes, it says &quot;such as&quot; Ethereum, but that is also the only option listed. Hence, the highest probability goes again to Ethereum!</p>\n\n<p>Again, just ask ourselves, why would Mastercard hire a Blockchain Lead Software Engineer with experience in Ethereum and Solidity? The answer is obvious!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
