It&amp;#39;s a perfect storm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is people are having to adjust the budget and don&amp;#39;t have much to spare. Discretionary expenses are the first to go and unfortunately poor old crypto, being a speculative high risk asset class is one of the first to have money taken out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want the truth it will get much worse here short term before it gets better. I am bullish on the long term trajectory, but short term expect the suicide hotline to be pinned to the top of this sub soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
