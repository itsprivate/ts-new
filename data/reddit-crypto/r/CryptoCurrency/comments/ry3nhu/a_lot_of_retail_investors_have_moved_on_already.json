Ben Cowen has estimated 70% of his viewers have already left, which is completely insane! They&amp;#39;ll be back in future, and the daily thread will be full of moonbois once more, buying high and fomo&amp;#39;ing into coins that you bought for 5% of the price they are buying at. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noone can honestly say when we will recover from this downtrend, but historically speaking we always do eventually and the investors that stay around, hold good projects and accumulate during the lows are the ones that make it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if we keep dropping, do try and stick around, even if you have to cut some losses in the short term and switch to safer bets. If it is the bear market, then last time it took 12 whole months to reach the bottom and another 18 months for the bull to restart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it is just another mid-cycle low, even better, new all time highs will come this year and the people that left already will be absolutely gutted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There will be less of us in the daily but you&amp;#39;ll be surrounded by focused individuals that are prepared to grind it out and who will be handsomely rewarded next time out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re reading this, WAGMI&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
