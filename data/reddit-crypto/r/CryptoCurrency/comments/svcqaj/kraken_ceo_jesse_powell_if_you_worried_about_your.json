One of his followers just replied Jesse that Kraken may be put in position to freeze our assets without judicial consent and will probably comply to that request. Jesse just 100% agreed with that person and on top of that suggested to keep funds away centralized exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s the first time we see any CEX CEO suggesting  to move away our funds from centralized custodians.  We should definitely appreciate the man for raising alarm and being so honest even though it may harm his business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6adhek7tuji81.png?width=711&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=82fdebbba0cb5ea86b4bebcdfa220c8c596304d3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/6adhek7tuji81.png?width=711&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=82fdebbba0cb5ea86b4bebcdfa220c8c596304d3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
