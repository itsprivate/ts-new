So we can&#39;t have cryptos without exchanges.</p>\n\n<p>And what are these exchanges? Let&#39;s talk about the biggest one: Binance.\nUntil you don&#39;t have any problem, everything seems to work fine.\nBut when you&#39;ll have a problem, you&#39;ll start to miss banks.</p>\n\n<p>I sent some crypto to my spot wallet on binance because I wanted to trade them. It was 10 days ago. I sent them and the transaction got confirmed 6 times in few seconds according to the blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>These coins never arrived in my Binance wallet.\nI mean Binance got them but didn&#39;t put them in my account.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Who knows? If it was a bank, I would just call them or pass by their offices and get my money. If they wouldn&#39;t give me, I would call the police.</p>\n\n<p>With binance i had to talk to a stupid chat bot that said to write a message and that I would contacted back by email. Nobody ever contacted me back. I never got my money and I can do literally nothing because this is a ghost company.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily we&#39;re talking about few bucks but the problem is big. If you go in the binance reddit you&#39;ll see how many people have problems with them.</p>\n\n<p>How cryptos can get adoption if we have to rely on these exchanges?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
