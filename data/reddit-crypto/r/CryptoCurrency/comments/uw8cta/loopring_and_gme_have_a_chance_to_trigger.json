There is a vision, there is a substantial user base of younger individuals poised to bring newer people into he fold. The infrastructure has been released and is getting immediate adoption. Regulation has been making its rounds through government. You can pay in crypto. The groundwork is set...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as the overall financial markets tumble and faith in their eco systems deteriorate, they are fertilizing the grounds of decentralized finance.  As people pull  their money of out of these institutions, fearful of collapse, it only makes sense that a new system will rise in it&amp;#39;s place. All major corporations are going to be watching GME and see what they are able to do, and if it even remotely begins to succeed, I think we&amp;#39;ll see a huge ramp of decentralized finance. It will no longer be speculative, it will live, in the wild as an example of the promise of crypto on the center stage.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could even be in a bear market, but if these funds that were reserved for banks start flowing into defi, simply for self custodial reasons, the market cap in crypto will balloon. We&amp;#39;re talking about scale we&amp;#39;ve been hypothesizing for years. Who knows, but this could be the catalyst we&amp;#39;ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
