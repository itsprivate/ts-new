It can be annoying but this one was different.</p>\n\n<p>My friend was asking me where she can work for cryptocurrency rather than investing in it. I suggested <a href=\"/r/Jobs4Bitcoins\">/r/Jobs4Bitcoins</a>, <a href=\"https://Grindez.com\">Grindez.com</a>, and maybe <a href=\"/r/ForHire\">/r/ForHire</a></p>\n\n<p>Friend did her first remote freelancing gig in Bitcoin for $950 on <a href=\"https://grindez.com\">Grindez</a>. She finished her job up then at the end of her job she gets paid. </p>\n\n<p>Calls me in panic as she&#39;s got a bit over $1,500 displayed on her account. She straight up thought she overcharged the client. 😂 </p>\n\n<p>I explain not to worry, her Bitcoin just appreciated over the week. I could hear the amazement in her voice and it was a really nice feeling to help out my friend. </p>\n\n<p><strong>More worthwhile to teach someone than do it for them</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
