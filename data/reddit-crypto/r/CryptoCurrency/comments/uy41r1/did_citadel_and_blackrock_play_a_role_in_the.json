If you haven&amp;#39;t already, &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2022/05/25/from-hero-to-zero-how-terra-was-toppled-in-cryptos-darkest-hour/?sh=685a29e389e2\"&gt;here&amp;#39;s how it went down&lt;/a&gt;: Luna plummeted 100% after its stable coin depegged from $1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It appears that UST/LUNA was attacked, but how did this happen? Well… maybe if you hadn&amp;#39;t declared to the world how to precisely implode your coin and told billionaires to &amp;quot;try it&amp;quot;, then maybe this wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened LOL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here’s the interesting part… &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immediately after LUNA&amp;#39;s downfall, there was a &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/f1rvti5wury81.jpg\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Blackrock and Citadel had borrowed 100k BTC and exchanged 25k for UST which dried up most of its liquidity. After that, it&amp;#39;s thought they threw the remaining 75k on the market, causing Luna to implode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a pure profit play if a short was opened at the top. Do Kwon (CEO) (probably) fell for the 25k BTC trade bait and accidentally was responsible for his currency&amp;#39;s fate. Again this is just theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
