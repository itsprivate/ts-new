For some context, Bitcoin traded at exactly the same price last week and even dipped just below $54,000.</p>\n\n<p>For the long-term, take a look at where 2017&#39;s epic $20,000 bull run is, and you&#39;ll understand that this is a long-term game</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re worried about today&#39;s dip, then there&#39;s a chance that you&#39;re over-leveraged. Only invest an amount you can afford to lose. That way you can enjoy Bitcoin&#39;s rollercoaster ride en route to the top.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the last run gave us five-digit BTC, there&#39;s a chance we&#39;ll see a six-figure BTC price by the end of this cycle. Don&#39;t trade that for a $4,000 price dip.</p>\n\n<p>HODL on!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
