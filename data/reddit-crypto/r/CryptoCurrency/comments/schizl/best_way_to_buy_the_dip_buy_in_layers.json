Lets use bitcoin for example, its at about 36.5k right now. If I have $10,000 to spend, I don&amp;#39;t want to just wait until it drops a bit and just spend the $10,000 all at once. I start edging in, just in case it goes lower to protect me from volatility. I set up buy orders:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$1,000 at 34k&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$2,000 at 32k&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$3,000 at 30k&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$4,000 at 28k&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t perfect, but it has protected me from volatility a bit and certainly stopped me from dropping all my money on a coin at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some people are saying this is DCAing. Dollar Cost Averaging is investing money at certain intervals regardless of the price. For my example it would be like $1000 a month over the next 10 months&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
