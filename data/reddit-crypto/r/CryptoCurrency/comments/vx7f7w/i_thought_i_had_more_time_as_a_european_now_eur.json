Now I&amp;#39;m finding that the money I earned during the last year-period is worth 20% less. Imagine my joy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dazmnfjxx3b91.png?width=1366&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=481196262d8b9e2fc4c7f52791d6acbd913fb804\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dazmnfjxx3b91.png?width=1366&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=481196262d8b9e2fc4c7f52791d6acbd913fb804&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this doesn&amp;#39;t even take in consideration inflation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get sad when out stock/crypto plummets -20%... Why don&amp;#39;t we have the same reaction with FIAT? It&amp;#39;s literally the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m personally not invested more than 20% of my entire wealth into crypto, because (let&amp;#39;s be honest), it&amp;#39;s a high-risk asset, or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m everyday more convinced that the difference between crypto and FIAT is very subtle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, starting last month I decided to drastically increase my DCA amount, but always remaining to a comfortable level. I still want to sleep well at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post may seem like a rant towards the financial system (maybe it is who cares), but I&amp;#39;m sure you understand that behind the frustration lies a very hard truth:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Traditional Financial System cannot hold like this forever. It need to change. Soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
