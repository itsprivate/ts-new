It’s especially great if you’re constantly moving around smaller amounts between exchanges and you’re a frequent buyer of smaller cap coins from exchanges like KUcoin like me. I’ll list the fees/withdrawal limits to give everyone a practical idea of how it works</p>\n\n<p>Minimum binance withdrawal for BTC is currently 0.001 which is ~£40/$56. Every transacation comes at a cost of 0.0005 BTC which is ~£20/$28, meaning if you’re looking to withdraw around £200/$280 you’re already around 10% down. Over time if you’re frequently looking to buy smaller coins not listed on major, this really starts to add up.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly with Eth, minimum withdrawal amount is 0.016 which is ~£45/$63 with a fee of 0.005 on every transaction which is around £15/$21 every transaction, looking to withdraw £200/$280 there and you’re down around 8%.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at XLM, minimum withdrawal amount is 40 which is ~£16/$22 at current prices. a what really stands out though is the transaction fee, you’re looking at an 0.02 fee every time which is less than £0.01! </p>\n\n<p>The great thing about XLM is that it’s also available on the vast majority of exchanges, so converting it back after is super easy. There are other coins which work with the tiny fees, but in terms of availability they aren’t always listed across exchanges so XLM is the perfect middle ground.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
