That&amp;#39;s indeed some much needed and appreciated relief we are getting right now after months of constant extreme fear and red candles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long we will continue to rally or how sustainable this rally is, is quite debate-able but we should just get a bit happy for the moment now, we dont get such times always in crypto and especially after the years past few months. Also we are not having any significant planned economic event next month as there is no FOMC to raise rates. So we may have some space left on this rally...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
