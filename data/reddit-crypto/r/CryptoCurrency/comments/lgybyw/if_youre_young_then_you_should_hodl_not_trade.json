Continue to add to your positions through DCA methods and invest larger sums when there are pullbacks or dips. “Timing the market” is absolutely the worst thing you can do because you will lose. Nobody can time the market.. you may get lucky once in a while, but 9 times out of 10 you will lose, especially when you factor in capital gains tax. Avoid the tax man by buying and HODLing! It’s as simple as that. This is a long-term play. Zoom out to see what I’m talking about.</p>\n\n<p>Godspeed fellow investors, see you at the moon 🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
