Finally, I was out of these stocks and could buy assets I believe in. But I was stupid and greedy. The crypto market was going up and I wanted to wait for a red day to buy. It wasn&amp;#39;t even that much of a difference, but since it was a large amount of cash (for me), it just felt better psychologically to buy on a dip.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the dip never came. 42k never dropped to 41. Instead it has been shooting up everyday all the way to 47 now and beyond. If I just would have bought at 42k, I would be done, happy, and not feel like an idiot for trying to time the market.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t be me in the future. Don&amp;#39;t try to time the market in hopes of getting a slightly better price (unless you are an expert trader, which I am not). The best way to make money in this crazy market is to buy the best cryptos (BTC, ETH, and maybe a few top L1s) and chill. I knew this and try to always do it, but I got greedy once and got burnt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
