He was dismissed for &amp;#39;raging&amp;#39; and Do Kwon was &amp;#39;pretty confident&amp;#39; that it would work (you can already tell what&amp;#39;s about to happen) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In April this year, as per responsible disclosure,   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/skgBanga\"&gt;@skgBanga&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xfr_\"&gt;@0xfr_&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;emailed the Anchor team, describing three issues in detail (one of which could potentially cause hugely unfair liquidations due to a major bug in the liquidation queue). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Anchor team never replied. Did they ignore the email? Did they just not bother checking their inbox? Either way, during last week&amp;#39;s meltdown, Anchor accrued $20.8m in bad debt at a direct cost to depositors. &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/throwaway0xfr/anchor-bad-debt\"&gt;https://github.com/throwaway0xfr/anchor-bad-debt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing a lot of reports in the Anchor Discord of people being liquidated for their entire collateral instead of just what they owed. This bug explains it. Carelessness led to people&amp;#39;s money being unfairly snatched away (again) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of things, $20.8m is not that much (especially when UST was shedding billions from its market cap), but this event lends to a certain culture &amp;amp; environment that seem to be present at TFL. Despite being paid millions, they seem to be flippant at times. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whole Thread: &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1528404015767343105\"&gt;https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1528404015767343105&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
