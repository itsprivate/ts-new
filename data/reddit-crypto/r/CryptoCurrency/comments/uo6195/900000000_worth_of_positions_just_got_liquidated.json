Stop trying to catch falling knives people! Wait a couple of days for things to stabilise a little. We are in the middle of a major disaster and people keep trying to make a quick buck using leverage. Unless you are an insider and you know something in advance using leverage will only fill someone else&amp;#39;s pockets instead of yours. May as well go to Vegas and put it all on black. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s even more insane is the fact that in the last 24h majority of them were longs! Yes, longs. The market keeps going down like crazy with everything going on and yet people put shorts down. Like... why?
