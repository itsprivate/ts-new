Learn to think critically and for once, to actually be impartial to whatever bags you may or may not have. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A recent example is the supposed &amp;quot;delay&amp;quot; in Ethereum&amp;#39;s merge. You can&amp;#39;t delay something that never had an agreed upon date. Rather then saying it how is, with Ethereum devs getting closer to a finalized date for the merge, misleading titles get upvoted by people seeking confirmation bias rather then trying to understand what is actually going on in the development process. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It applies to Cardano the same way it applies to Ethereum and any other project. You&amp;#39;ll never succeed in crypto if you keep trying to prove your biases right and refuse to see things for what they actually are. A successful investor considers facts rather then personal feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
