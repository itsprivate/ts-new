Or at best, breaking even. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had bought BCash when it launched in Aug 2017 at $500, you would be down now ($133).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had bought BCash in peak of 2017 cycle i.e Dec 2017 at $1500 to $3000, you would be down now.. by a big margin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had bought Bcash in depths of last bear market (Jan 2019) at $100-$140, you would be slightly up or just around break even after 3 years ($133)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had bought Bcash in July 2019 at $300, you would be down now ($133)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you had bought BCash in depths of covid crash (17 March 2020) at $170, you would still be down now ($133)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can pretty much choose any buying point for Bcash, and odds are you would be in losses now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if you had bought any random coin in the Covid crash, you would likely be up. If you had bought DOGE or Polygon or just blindly picked another one, you would have been up thousands of %.. but not BCH BCash. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, according to Canadian regulators, one can buy as much of Bcash they want to but have to limit purchases of other coins to just $30k per year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By what logic does this make any sense? Protecting investors? When BCash has never generated any returns in it history? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, it may make sense from a regulatory perspective to limit people&amp;#39;s exposure to risky crypto, but to include BCH in the list of coins that people can buy without limits? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It shows regulators are full of crap and have no understanding of crypto markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Lol so many bcashers have arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OP is a bitter liar&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What am I bitter about, missing out on all the losses? lmao&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people actually think regulators chose BCH based on utility or adoption? Lol thats even absurd. BCH has less than 30k transactions on most days. Even chains outside the top 50 have more adoption in terms of volume transacted or txn/day. BCH has no utility or adoption that isnt just fringe BCH enthusiasts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its totally absurd to think regulatory actions are based on utility. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The limits are based on &amp;quot;investor protection&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/canadian-securities-regulators-expect-commitments-crypto-trading-platforms-pursuing-registration\"&gt;https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/canadian-securities-regulators-expect-commitments-crypto-trading-platforms-pursuing-registration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;crypto trading platforms agree to comply with terms and conditions that address investor protection concerns&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://help.newton.co/hc/en-us/articles/8216687424915-What-are-these-new-regulatory-changes-August-2022-\"&gt;https://help.newton.co/hc/en-us/articles/8216687424915-What-are-these-new-regulatory-changes-August-2022-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These changes are to protect crypto investors, like yourself, and to make sure investors are aware of the risks associated with investing in crypto assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its about &amp;quot;protecting&amp;quot; crypto investors. I.e ensuring they dont lose their money. Not about picking which coin has utility or adoption. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given that its about protecting investors, it makes no sense to include BCash - a coin that has not had any long term returns worth even talking about.&lt;/strong&gt; Most of long term BCash holders are sitting on various degrees of losses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
