Basically this means buying from every paycheck as much as possible. It&amp;#39;s the FIRE type of investing but replace S&amp;amp;P500 with bitcoin. It&amp;#39;s been going pretty well, a couple of crashes here and there. If you manage to keep your emotions at bay, there&amp;#39;s no better way of accumulating capital (and freedom in your life). I started to document my journey in this blog. Hopefully it gives you motivation to do something similar!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-21-april-2022/\"&gt;https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-21-april-2022/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
