For example with 80/20 ratio, 80 percent of the asset would be taken out as it hits various milestones and 20 would be left on hold. With DCA in the purchases occur regardless of the asset&#39;s price and at regular intervals. With DCA out it&#39;s slightly different in that you take money out as you hit certain asset price milestones. This works pretty well during a bullrun especially. Here&#39;s a example of it.</p>\n\n<p>Coin A is worth $10 000 at this point. After doing some research and checking various sources you believe that the price can go up to $35 000 during this bull run.</p>\n\n<p>Then you split this coin into two parts, 20% you will not touch and 80% you will take profits.</p>\n\n<p>Then you create your thresholds. Here is an example:</p>\n\n<p>$15 000 - Taking out 20% of 80% (Or 16% of the total) - $2400 profit</p>\n\n<p>$20 000 - Taking out 20% of 80% (Or 16% of the total) - $3200 profit</p>\n\n<p>$25 000 - Taking out 20% of 80% (Or 16% of the total) - $4000 profit</p>\n\n<p>$30 000 - Taking out 20% of 80% (Or 16% of the total) - $4800 profit</p>\n\n<p>$35 000 - Taking out 20% of 80% (Or 16% of the total) - $5600  profit</p>\n\n<p>Total profit: $20 000</p>\n\n<p>20% of $35 000 stays in the coin - $7000 in holdings</p>\n\n<p>This is not a financial advice, and it could very well be that you would&#39;ve profited more without taking anything out and just hodling for the next 5 years. This is more of a safe play, with potential to reinvest if the market cools down. Would be interested to hear any comments on this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
