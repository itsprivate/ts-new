Don&amp;#39;t panic. Don&amp;#39;t give up. And when things look bleak, and they will, remember last five or six months and tell newbies about it. Market might dive again but no matter what happens, I believe this is a market as though as a bear and as crazy as a bull. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have the knowledge to buy the right coin and the patience not to panic, you will be rewarded. \nNo matter bull or bear market (and I don&amp;#39;t know which one we are in). Because with a little luck, a solid project will always rise again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
