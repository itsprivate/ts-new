If your risk tolerance is low or just want to have a backup coin incase all alts crash, <em>slaps hood</em> this is the bad boy for you. Long term hodl will give great returns.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ethereum: Fundamentally, the greatest coin of them all with a humongous ecosystem and proven blockchain. If Bitcoin was introduced after Ethereum, I&#39;m certain that it wouldn&#39;t have been able to live up to the standards of this coin. Although it has come under scrutiny for its PoW and high txn fees, as soon as ETH 2.0 comes out all of this will be gone and it will literally fly.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Projects that have all been once called to be &quot;Ethereum killers&quot;:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Polkadot: Currently in the phase of rolling out parachains, once completed we can see it moon (for reference, Kusama launched parachains last week and a saw a major price boost)</p></li>\n<li><p>Cosmos: Development on the chain has been quite active recently.
