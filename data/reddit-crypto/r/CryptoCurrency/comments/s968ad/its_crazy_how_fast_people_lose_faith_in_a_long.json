Therefore in a year or so we will be laughing at these prices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all say we’re long term investing, but I don’t think people know what a long term investment means. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means no matter what happens, YOU DO NOT SELL. Your scope is 5-10 years maybe even 3 but that’s what a long term investment is. You don’t just start selling at a loss at the first sight of trouble. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin trends up with time. If you want to win you must HODL and buy more. These are the times when millionaires are made. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will be rewarded for buying into fear. This is not hopium, this is a fact. Throughout history whenever markets have crashed, the ones that had money to buy the crash always came out on top. Nothing is lost until you sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As much as this sub preaches buy high sell low. Profits are taken at the top, not at the bottom. Bitcoin will survive and recover. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However the people who bought alts that have no purpose but hype at ATH’s are in for a rude awakening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
