Ever since then I&#39;ve been neglecting everything else in my life.</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t surprised by my destructive addiction. Before crypto I was addicted to something else---Youtube, commentaries, and beauty guru drama. I was a shut-in loser with no job and no friends. Due to 3 years of high school bullying and dysfunction family, I suffered from major depression and anxiety disorder that kept me from functioning in workplace or school. So when all of my former classmates graduated from college with bachelor&#39;s on June of 2020. A lot of them got high paying jobs straight out of college. My self esteem hit rock bottom. Only my former close friends keep in touch with me, but I ghosted them. That&#39;s when I got into crypto. I was bored. I had 3k in savings from my sporadic minimum wage jobs. I was a dropout, jobless, and living with parents at 22. I wanted to make a quick buck and to make myself feel better. (I never traded btw. I merely bought and hodl)</p>\n\n<p>Then I got me a temp 3 month contract job that snagged me some quick money. In that job, you work alone. It was very emotionally taxing. I got even more alone, but I was making money. Made $8k total. All into crypto, again.</p>\n\n<p>I also downloaded Robinhood back in April, which sat at a -20% from shitty stocks I bought. In August I found Wallstreetbets. Got a bit obsessed reading the memes there. I was avoiding reality by distracting myself, but I did bought some stuff and turned my profit to +50% by December.</p>\n\n<p>My crypto made gains too. I think it was like 20% gain. I was happy, mostly bc I discovered Lazarus Naturals and took a lot of CBD pills(my antidepressants ran out) and I also vaped a lot more. I hit my goal weight for December 2020. I went back to school and didn&#39;t fail my first semester. I only checked my ledger once a week. I never looked at the charts.</p>\n\n<p>Then GME happened. I started looking at the charts, the news, etc everyday bc WSB made it seem like a revolution. Right after that, Doge mooned, then everything else.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s when I fomoed a lot. I bought mostly Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the two stayed dormant when literally every other crypto mooned. During the December run, I sold half of my LINK and XLM into bitcoin at 31k. Had I not done it, I would&#39;ve had a much higher profit. People who got into crypto in January that just bought random alts have made more profits than me. I was jealous, and started chasing pumps, to no avail. I invest more than I wanted in crypto. The $2k I made from GME also went into crypto, which is now sitting at a loss.(only counting that ones I bought since January)</p>\n\n<p>It got worse that I peeped into the cryptocurrency discord. People were making 50x gains from leveraged trading. My portfolio has tripled, which is supposed to be a good thing. But it&#39;s upsetting when people who&#39;s been around for 2 weeks and calls crypto &#39;shares&#39; made 10x gains from some alts they knew nothing about, while you hold heavy bags that hardly move. I was especially upset when I was gonna buy BNB at $100 but never did. Not it&#39;s $280 or something.</p>\n\n<p>Today was a sign. A few days ago I signed up for <a href=\"https://crypto.com\">crypto.com</a> for the $25 bonus. I realized I had to buy and stake 5000 CRO to get the bonus, for a card I don&#39;t really need, so I declined. Today the price shot up as you can see. So far it&#39;s up 87%. I fomo&#39;d in, but my bank declined the purchase, which was a good thing bc, like I said, I don&#39;t really need the card.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m taking this as a wake-up call. I&#39;m going to leave reddit temporarily, discord forever, uninstall Coingecko, etc. I will not come back until I have finished my 2nd semester, which ends on June 30th. I&#39;m only coming back for my Zilliqa which is stuck in Binance for a few more day.</p>\n\n<p>At the meantime, I&#39;m going to try to accelerate and finish college, get a part time job, etc. I&#39;m going to get my life back on track. I&#39;ve put in $13k into crypto($11k before December and $2k fomo these few weeks). I only got $1k in fiat left in my bank. I&#39;m not going to put in any more money. If all crypto went to zero, then it&#39;ll be a $13k lesson. If not, then it&#39;d be a nice surprise after I finish my semester.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m blocking reddit now. I&#39;ll see you in June.</p>\n\n<p>edit: thanks for all the well wishes! and for the &#39;c u tomorrow&#39; guy, yeah hopefully not lol bc I want to finish school first. I&#39;m also gonna try to reconnect with my friends and go out more again. They know my mental health issues so hopefully they&#39;ll understand.</p>\n\n<p>I wont uninstall the app bc i don&#39;t wanna lose my vault again lol. so im turning off my notifications. See you all in June! :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
