Seeing these posts suggest that a lot of people think bitcoin is a safe bet and wanting to buy other coins to outpace bitcoin - all while calling that diversifiyng. Bitcoin is still considered a speculative asset, so buying shitcoins that are basically tied to bitcoin (in the sense that if bitcoin takes a dump, the rest of crypto takes a dump too). </p>\n\n<p>Buying these shitcoins to reduce your investment risk is IMO wrong. You can win more, but you can also lose more buying shitcoins. It’s gambling, not risk management.</p>\n\n<p>Just to clarify - i believe there are lots of useful and innovative projects on the market, and i support investing in those. But putting 50$ in every shitcoin you hear being shilled online is not investing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
