You can&amp;#39;t associate constant dumps and weak pumps Bitcoin has been going through for the last 4 months as a bull market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Cowen is one of the few people I follow and I enjoy his content. It&amp;#39;s sad to him say his theory of lengthening cycles is dead, because it made the most sense. As an asset gets bigger, it obviously takes more money to move it up hence more time. Also, every Bitcoin cycle has seemed like it was progressively getting longer if you measure it from cycle bottoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ym1kycwyl8y81.png?width=595&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=77e259cb883425ccc915974eb75452c90cf84073\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ym1kycwyl8y81.png?width=595&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=77e259cb883425ccc915974eb75452c90cf84073&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mc0c80fwm8y81.png?width=589&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0560ebfc99b268861e9bc617644a307749ff8417\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mc0c80fwm8y81.png?width=589&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0560ebfc99b268861e9bc617644a307749ff8417&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What he says makes sense, even if we were to somehow pump up from here it wouldn&amp;#39;t erase all this downwards movement we had to go through. It would be hard to classify the past 2 years as part of the bull market. If the high inflation numbers and the situation with the FED wasn&amp;#39;t a thing, I think his theory would have been correct. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
