I ponied up $1500 to &lt;a href=\"https://Cointracker.io\"&gt;Cointracker.io&lt;/a&gt; for their premium version that covers 100k+ transactions, but can&amp;#39;t get anything out of that system either. When I try to connect Cointracker via Turbotax, it errors out everytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HR Block suggested using cointracker also, but then it doesn&amp;#39;t appear there is anywhere to actually import anything, so I don&amp;#39;t know why they suggest using it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone report on huge number of crypto transactions have some advice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: United states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit2: Calling a professional and filing an extension.
