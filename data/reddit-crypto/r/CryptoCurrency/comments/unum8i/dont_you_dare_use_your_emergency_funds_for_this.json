You looked at your bank account and think: Hey, a couple of grand wouldn&amp;#39;t be that bad, it&amp;#39;s going back up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#39;s going back up, but not in the short term tho. If you need money for bills, food and accommodation, please stop yourself from doing stupid shit. If you have a DCA schedule, be disciplined and stick with it. If you want to catch falling knives, do it only with your disposable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m saying this because I was once blindly buying and even cashed out my emergency funds. I even have to borrow money from my girlfriend to just survive. Now I&amp;#39;ve learnt my lessons: DCA or buy the dips only with your disposable money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to be like me, and I don&amp;#39;t want you to.  Stay sane and stay safe, it&amp;#39;s going to be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
