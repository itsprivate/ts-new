Solana now natively brings this kind of user experience to the blockchain where you can experience network failure on the chain. What a wonderful innovation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
