This upgrade is set to change the entire fee market operations on the Ethereum network, as it will be bringing a discrete fee base that is burned instead of being paid to the miners, and an elimination to the first-price auction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This upgrade won’t be having a direct impact on the gas fees, but it will be allowing the users to estimate the costs better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another main impact of this upgrade is that it’ll be having a deflationary impact on MATIC. Since Polygon’s total supply of tokens is fixed at 10 billion, the reduction of the token number will be having a direct deflationary impact on the asset. A we know, 0.27% of the total supply will be burned annually, which means 27 million MATIC. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This upgrade is going to have a positive impact on the dApps users, as they’ll be enjoying even lower fees, and developers will be receiving a boost as well. Not to forget that the EIP 1559 will also minimize the number of spam transactions and the network congestion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, will this upgrade have a direct impact on MATIC’s price?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
