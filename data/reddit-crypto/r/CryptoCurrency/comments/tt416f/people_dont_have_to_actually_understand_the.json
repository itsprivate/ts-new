But if you think of it most people still have no idea how a computer works, I don&amp;#39;t mean they don&amp;#39;t know how to operate one , I mean they don&amp;#39;t know what makes up a computer and how it actually works.  It&amp;#39;s the same with Bluetooth or most of technology itself. Consumers  stop caring or trying to figure out how most things work once it starts working for then or provide utility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto has hopes of solving many problems but people aren&amp;#39;t able to wrap their minds around it (Nfts made it even harder). On top of that most of crypto is hard. Part of the reason most people are still using exchanges to store crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course none of it would matter if it is possible for it to be conveniently part of peoples life and is solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should stop explaining how things work to the average Joe and force him to into investing instead we need utility for the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once utility comes in , we wouldn&amp;#39;t have any other option other than adopt crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
