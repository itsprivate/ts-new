For more information about Moons, please <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki\">see our wiki page here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Moon Week began yesterday with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1fx2w/new_moons_distribution_round_20_proposal/\">the snapshot post by the admins</a>.  The ratio is 0.201 and you can check out the post and comments to see how many moons you&#39;ll be getting next Wednesday at the end of Moon Week.</p>\n\n<p>To give exposure to our governance polls for the month, this Moon Week post will remain pinned to the top of the subreddit until the distribution post next Wednesday.  <strong>Please review the following important information first.  Each month we have dozens of questions about these things even though they are answered right here</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you can&#39;t see polls or vote</strong>, or have any other issue, try again later or from a different platform (different browser, app, mobile, or desktop).  These glitches usually resolve themselves within a few hours, but let us know if it hasn&#39;t after a day or two.</li>\n<li><strong>You can&#39;t change your vote</strong> so make sure you read the full post and discussions, and ask any questions you have before you vote.  There are people wishing they voted differently every month and you have several days to vote so there is no need to rush it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m7ehzz/proposal_5_bonus_moons_for_anyone_who_votes_on/\">CCIP-006 implemented a 5% bonus for voting in at least 1 poll</a>, plus <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pffoe7/incentivize_voting_in_multiple_polls/\">an additional 1.25% for each additional governance poll was implemented by CCIP-014</a></li>\n<li>You will also get a special badge for a week after voting in a governance poll.  These are visible in the reddit app and new.reddit on desktop.  If you have voted and yours is not showing, you may need to enable it manually by clicking your badges and looking at the Achievements tab.</li>\n<li>Successful polls are implemented whenever the mods or admins have a chance to do it.  Usually this is within days or weeks of the poll passing, but depends on workload, priorities, and complexity of implementation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are your polls for round 20 of Moons.  Each poll has been given a designated CCIP number, as per <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pxyhhg/implement_numbering_of_proposals_ccips/\">CCIP-017</a>.  You can now view <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/ccip_list\">the full CCIP list here</a>. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1nxe4/ccip019_disable_live_posts/\">CCIP-019 - Disable Live Posts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1mlrx/ccip021_temporarily_sort_comments_by_newest_first/\">CCIP-021 - Temporarily sort comments by newest first after a post is submitted</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1uqrc/ccip022_reducing_the_doublekarma_for_comments/\">CCIP-022 - Reducing the double-karma for comments within Comedy posts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1uphn/ccip023_moons_multiplier_for_the_new_flair_system/\">CCIP-023 - Moons Multiplier for the new Flair System</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As noted in the repeat polls, CCIPs 19 and 21 are repeats this month.  New ideas will get priority, but we are allowing previous polls to be run again if they had strong support and just didn&#39;t reach the decision threshold.  If there was a poll in the past that you liked, head on over to <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta\">r/CryptoCurrencyMeta</a> to let us know you&#39;d like to run it again.</p>\n\n<p>Please also see <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1yjco/moon_week_20_new_governance_polls_and_the_state/hm1jewq/\">the pinned comment below to read the latest State of the MOONion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Happy voting and happy Thanksgiving! 🦃</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
