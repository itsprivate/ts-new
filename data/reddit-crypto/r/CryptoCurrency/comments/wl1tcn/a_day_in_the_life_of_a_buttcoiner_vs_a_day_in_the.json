Breakfast is the most important meal of the day afterall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While you smoke and watch a video of Joe Rogan fighting a polar bear and Alex Jones in a bikini, you decide to go to buttcoin subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 3pm. To your amusement you find out BTC crashed 10% and all the crypto people are yelling &amp;quot;10k EOY&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fuck the metaverse&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You feel empowered and quickly right a 100-word essay on why crypto is bad and bitcoin is not worth anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 11pm and you are finally done writing your 100 word post. It cost you your last brain cell but it was worth it. Your buttcoiner friends will surely enjoy the effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You post the essay. You get a couple &amp;quot;so true bro&amp;quot; and even a DM from &amp;quot;RealJoeRogan&amp;quot; account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You go to bed dreaming about tomorrow&amp;#39;s cigarette and new crypto hack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CC SUBREDDITOR:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You wake up at 4:20pm. You jerk off to your fav youtuber shilling your fav altcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 4:21pm. You are done jerking off and decide to check BTC charts. There&amp;#39;s blood in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You decide to still DCA. You go to CC and write a 100-word essay on why DCA is the best strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 4:30pm. You are done with your essay and post it. You wrote it so quickly half the shit makes no sense. But people on CC won&amp;#39;t read more than 50 words anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You spend the rest of the day chart watching and finally go to bed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next morning you find out your post made it to the frontpage. You just farmed 5000 karma. At a 0.8 moon ratio that&amp;#39;s 4000 moons. At today&amp;#39;s price that&amp;#39;s  almost $1000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;cries in buttcoiner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
