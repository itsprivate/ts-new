In this thread, I will share my experience on the perfect breakdown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To start, you want at least 70% in BTC. This is the granddaddy of all coins and your most stable. The higher the percentage of BTC, the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next is ETH, I’ve found 60% is a good level. Even if you just have BTC and ETH, you will have 130% of your portfolio in 2 coins, up for 100% you started with. To instantly have 30% more, you are genius. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next up is the large-cap alts. I like 30% here. You can LRDYOR (let Redditors do your own research) to decide which coin is best for you, but possible examples are SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, AVAX, etc. Following advice up to this point, you have at least 160% portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping 20% stables is key to any portfolio. You can earn interest (up to 20%) on stables, plus any price action. I saw one tik-tok’er predict Tether would go to $5 this year. I think that’s bullish, but I can easily see USDT going to $3. Let’s say you earn 20% interest on your 20% investment, you now have 40% (compounding interest works wonders). Now your portfolio allocation is at 200% and you have doubled your money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you have doubled your money, going for 100% portfolio allocation to 200%, you have freedom to gamble on low cap coins. I’d keep this to 10%. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This strategy will work for everyone. It will instantly turn you into a billionaire overnight. Follow me for more financial advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
