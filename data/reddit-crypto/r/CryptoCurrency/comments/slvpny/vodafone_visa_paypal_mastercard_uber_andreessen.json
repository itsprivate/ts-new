The investment amount would have increased 4x if they just have bought Bitcoin instead.",

So, for now the project is almost abandoned and dead as per bloomberg. &amp;quot;Meta&amp;quot; recently announced that they are planning to sell the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a clear example why you should avoid VC funded decentralized projects with CEO, CFOs. All those schemes are vulnerable to regulatory annihilation or chief executive rug pull.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis is why El Salvador is bitcoin only!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
