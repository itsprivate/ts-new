But in the end, the BTC value of my portfolio is just about back to where it would have been, had I just hodled (only because I eventually got lucky, AND learned to be patient). </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, my girlfriend has never asked me how her investment was doing ever since, or checked the price of crypto. I don&#39;t know how she does it. She spared herself all the stress and, you guessed it: her portfolio has performed better than mine. </p>\n\n<p>She is the perfect hodler. Be like her.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
