Say $1,000,000.    You held for 40 years.  That&#39;s $1M is now worth $333,333.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s because of buying power.</p>\n\n<p>Your $1 now was worth $3 in 1981.   Especially if you HODL it in a bank. </p>\n\n<p>Many years ago, it was common people recieved a tiny interest in the common bank. Now it&#39;s opposite. You pay them service fees once a month.  </p>\n\n<p>This is why they say dump into a 401K so it builds interest.   But even that hurts. </p>\n\n<p>The annual ROI on 401K is 3-8%.   Let&#39;s say you average out 5.5% ROI over 40 years. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with year 1\n in 1981\n when you were 25yrs old.<br/>\nYou decide to make a one time investment into 401K of $5000. </p>\n\n<p>After 40 years , that $5K you dumped in is \nappx $42,550.   That&#39;s about an 851% ROI HODLing for 40 years straight.<br/>\n Looks good on paper? \nSure it does.</p>\n\n<p>but thanks to inflation, that $42,500 now was only $14,200 back when you started HOdling    So really, your ROI after 40yrs is 283% not 851%.  </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s not forget tax when you withdraw because it now counts as yearly income.\nEspecially if you&#39;re forced to withdraw early for whatever tragic reason.    So your ROI is even worse than 280%.   Might be 200% or less. </p>\n\n<p>But What If you&#39;re forced to retire the year 401Ks tanked 50%  In 2008?\n during housing bubble.   </p>\n\n<p>There were many people that year forced to retire for X reason and had to withdraw.   </p>\n\n<p>Pretty shitty deal for something that was supposed to be safe.   40 years Hold??? </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re not even guaranteed to live for 40 more years. You might drop dead before you see your money. </p>\n\n<p>But with crypto, I may be at risk for being at a loss but I also have chances to get 283% ROI in 4 days during bull runs nevermind 40 fuuking years, and even in bear markets.   </p>\n\n<p>You won&#39;t get that Holding USD in a bank. </p>\n\n<p>If someone tells you crypto is risky because you can lose.    Ask them if they are good at saving money in the bank.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a trick question.  Usually cockiness will kick in and they will openly admit they save money in the bank.      Good. </p>\n\n<p>Laugh it off and walk away.  </p>\n\n<p>These people don&#39;t know what the FK they are doing and if they did they would be buying cryptos.   </p>\n\n<p>USD is a medium of exchange only.  Don&#39;t hold that. Spend it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
