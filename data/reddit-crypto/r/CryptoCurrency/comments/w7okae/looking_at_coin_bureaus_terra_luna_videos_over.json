  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coin Bureau, hosted by Guy is almost the guaranteed answer to anyone asking on here the age old question of &amp;quot;but is there any good YouTube channels to follow&amp;quot;. It is presented as the gold standard, and honestly most others set a very low bar. So I&amp;#39;ll use it as an example to get a point across.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not bashing Guy or his channel as if you&amp;#39;ve ever watched a video of his, he makes it abundantly clear &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;#39;s not financial advice&lt;/strong&gt;. As far as I know he just presents the information available to him as best he can and tries to flag potential issues/risks even if overall enthusiastic for a project. Yet therein lays the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This crypto channel is not a source of truth or a confidence that you&amp;#39;ve picked a winner just because he doesn&amp;#39;t say run for the hills in the review. The Terra Luna story is the perfect case study. These are the channels videos on Terra over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 months ago video - Luna potentially heading to the moon&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7HLiZxkbxfY&amp;amp;t=48s\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7HLiZxkbxfY&amp;amp;t=48s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 months ago video - DeFi Stablecoins have benefits&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uLmVtec0px4\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uLmVtec0px4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 months ago video - Centralised stablecoins are risky, UST could moon Luna&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NiYUEBNvPPk\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NiYUEBNvPPk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 months ago video - Terra has collapsed&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0CutSymg94I\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0CutSymg94I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They made an incorrect investment, and did not foresee the impending collapse. Turns out Luna/UST were remarkably similar to fixed value convertible bonds aka debt spiral bonds...with the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to answer the question, no there is no guru or all knowing veteran you should just follow. Just because they are saying it&amp;#39;s not a scam or won&amp;#39;t end in a 12 foot high dumpster fire doesn&amp;#39;t mean it won&amp;#39;t. Nor will they be on time to tell you to get out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
