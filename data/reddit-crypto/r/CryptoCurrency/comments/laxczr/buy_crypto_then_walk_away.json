If you invest now and wait a year, 2 years, or even longer, I am confident you will see some nice growth in your portfolio. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve followed these guidelines for the past 3 years now, and last year I took out less than a third of my portfolio to pay off my student loans. Now I’m waiting even longer with my sights set on a down payment for a house.</p>\n\n<p>Set a goal when you invest and don’t sell or quit until that goal has been achieved. This is hands down the most promising investment, but you have to be patient to succeed. Good luck!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
