  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll admit it: I&amp;#39;ve kept a large sum of my crypto on Robinhood this whole time... until now. To be fair, I had stopped actively buying with them a year ago, but had decided not to sell since they had announced they were developing crypto wallets. So I decided to just hodl until I could transfer out... and that time has finally come! Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. &lt;strong&gt;As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s worth the gas price too (&lt;a href=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price\"&gt;which is a little lower than normal right now&lt;/a&gt;). If you&amp;#39;ve quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why transfer out?&lt;/em&gt; If you&amp;#39;re not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I (&lt;a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/\"&gt;see more about that here&lt;/a&gt;). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having &amp;quot;outages&amp;quot; during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 (&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html\"&gt;check that out here&lt;/a&gt;). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered &amp;quot;technical difficulties&amp;quot; during the epic Doge runup (&lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:%7E:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day\"&gt;more info here&lt;/a&gt;). So then, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that Robinhood&amp;#39;s interests are NOT with you. &lt;strong&gt;Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lmyhur/for_those_still_on_the_fence_with_robinhood_watch/\"&gt;Robinhood CEO can’t/won’t answer questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pw0kgt/leaked_documents_show_that_citadels_ceo_lied/\"&gt;Citadels CEO Lied Under Oath about a Collusion with Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lfrslo/reminder_robinhood_blocked_several_stocks_from/\"&gt;Robinhood locked the buy button when it suited them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I finally moved all my crypto off Robinhood now that they enabled my crypto wallet. You should too because they are shady AF.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
