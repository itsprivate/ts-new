I suspect we might actually see it hit ~1%. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is you can’t unstake without sacrificing a whopping 4-10%, which is unfortunately considering there are so many better deals now for ETH deposits (CDC, for example, offers 4.5-6.5% on a 3 month term).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moral Of The Story: Read the T&amp;amp;Cs and don’t take a bad deal just because it’s the only deal you have in front of you. Remember that something better might come tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
