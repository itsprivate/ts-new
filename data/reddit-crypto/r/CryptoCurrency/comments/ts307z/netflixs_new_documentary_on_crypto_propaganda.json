  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I  hate Netflix, let me be clear about this. I believe that netflix in  recent years has become one of the companies with the most power of influence, alongside META. Every Netflix series, film and documentary  has a hidden agenda or at least subliminal messages that always point to the same ideology, and worst of it all ... is that they are very good at  doing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to make this a political issue or spread  conspiracy theories because I&amp;#39;m here to talk about the new Netflix  series &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Trust No One: The Hunt For The Crypto King&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; the title itself  already tells us the message they want to get across. The documentary  tells the story of the alleged bankruptcy of Canada&amp;#39;s largest crypto  broker, and for someone who understands the concepts of crypto watching  the documentary is almost impossible, they try to look impartial and  factual but it becomes clear that they are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They  begin by framing what Bitcoin is to the viewer, the biggest reasoning for the people who invest in BTC is just &amp;quot;rebelling against the system&amp;quot;, they refusing to talk about key topics like decentralization, inflation, too much government power, security  or even the concept of limited supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0mtvsm5zuhq81.jpg?width=599&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6bf5d93c97abf298d07bd290d1ee0ea5ce5a099e\"&gt;Why the bloody fingerprint tho?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the average person this what  BTC is, a virtual currency that people grab by faith or rebellion, if  Bitcoin is so recognized and even so it is so useless imagine what the  average person will think of other cryptocurrencies in an industry that  is advertised as a ponzi scheme and a world full of scams, But I&amp;#39;m  rambling already. This is the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; part of the documentary, from there  Netflix uses all the dirty tricks to manipulate the viewer.. Those who  invest in crypto:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;do not have time to exercise&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;are nerds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;are looking to get rich fast&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;want to buy luxury cars (this is partially true)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;have no basic understanding of markets or how money works&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;are naive and easily manipulated (I see the irony)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They interview a guy that wanted to get rich fast as his friend did, so he asks for a high interest loan of the value of 85k$, what happens? he buys BTC high and the price crashes (typical redditor investor s/), he now is fu****, has to sell his house... but that is not enough, he proceeds to send 400k to the exchange with the intention to avoid bank fees, and now he lost all his money on QuadrigaCX scam...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This  documentary is a shameful attack on crypto but there is something good to pull out of here, Netflix and the big media have to resort to these  strategies because in a debate of ideas they lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They may try to postpone crypto, but they&amp;#39;re postponing the inevitable, I just  feel bad for the people who are manipulated by these kinds of  documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your attention, I don&amp;#39;t advise you to watch this , I wasted my time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
