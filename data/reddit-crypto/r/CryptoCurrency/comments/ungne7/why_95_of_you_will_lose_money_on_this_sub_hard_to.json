Every single post 9 times out of 10 was pure hopium and anyone with a different view was downvoted into oblivion. Majority of the posts here reminded me of the whole DOGE to the moon phase.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t learn anything new in here and have to resort to other subs to keep myself up to date with tech.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the people I see claiming to be in crypto for 10 years and just HODL are so full of shit by just doing a simple search through their post history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People were telling you at $50k &amp;quot;invest all your bags!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;BTC is on sale it will never be this low again&amp;quot;. Those same people claimed we were in a &amp;quot;bear market&amp;quot; I honestly heard that term thrown out so much that I even question if I know what it means anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome to an actual bear market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have the idea to HODL but many of you are completely over leveraged. You over invested what you could afford to lose and have the mindset that you&amp;#39;re still going to HODL. That&amp;#39;s ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heres what&amp;#39;s going to happen over the course of the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto market could get worse and stay like this for a couple years. Most of you will lose hope and something will come up in life (bills, trips, etc). You will take a little bit out promising you will put more back in eventually. Slowly depleting your portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Years will go by and the next run will come and then you will reinvest again but this time will be different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your lessons will be your own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re all full of shit on here no one knows shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start learning about the technology behind everything and the backend stuff in order to fully believe in crypto. Hopium posts on Reddit, MSNBC, tech crunch articles are not going to keep your hopes up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: There’s other subs on here that will be helpful. Discord groups, reading white papers, even Twitter has gold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c5j46/you_people_are_seriously_not_thinking_clearly/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\"&gt;Post from 9 years ago to help you understand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
