Crypto is in it full &amp;quot;mania&amp;quot; stage as the rise of meme coins takes place lead by the godfather of memes, Dogecoin itself. Dogecoin hits about 0.70 crossing the magical 0.69 mark. It&amp;#39;s just complete doge hype all over the internet. Investors are already seeing the 1$ mark in front of their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we are one year later. Since then DOGE only was in a downtrend from 0.70$ to 0.12$. Reasons are the overall Crypto dump but also fading interest and hype in the crypto itself. Which they are even trying to tackle right now with actual development and a roadmap. But this is not about doge. This is about not being too overconfident with your investment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being to overconfident will lead you to the blinded HODL. While holding may be a very good strategy in crypto its not always. Some cryptos rise others disappear you have to look into the market to know where your investments are heading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your crypto look weak over the longterm you should take the profit or if your crypto has done an unsustainable pump you should take a profit. Taking profit is not bad, it&amp;#39;s smart and wise, also you always have the option to buy low afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
