But judging by things around here I am guessing the modus operandi is going to be more and more whining, this time about how they &amp;#39;wished&amp;#39; they had sold. And then a couple of weeks or months from now when the market recovers (as it always does) we&amp;#39;ll have the same people whining about how they missed that golden opportunity of buying low yet again.. no wonder we have that prophetic joke about buying high and selling low. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think its about time to disrupt that problematic pattern of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
