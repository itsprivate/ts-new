My previous post were removed because I disclosed the scammer&#39;s identity.</p>\n\n<p>Does everyone WANT to get scammed? Here I am trying to bring him to justice and my posts get removed due to some stupid rules. Anyway, now, I will be telling you exactly how to figure his identity out yourself. If the scammer is reading this, he&#39;s probably laughing at me.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>No wonder a decentralized message board platform is desperately required.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This person has been involved in fraud amounting to multiple millions.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Initially, I came across this website: <a href=\"https://ocen.network/\">https://ocen.network/</a> Knowing it was a pre-sale scam, I ran metadata analysis on each file using <a href=\"https://exiftool.org/\">https://exiftool.org/</a>. The litepaper displayed the name “XXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXX” as the author.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>To prove that I did not alter the original documents, please check the link below, download the litepaper and run exiftool on it.</p>\n\n<p>Web Archive:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210625185716/https://ocen.network/\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210625185716/https://ocen.network/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Amount he’s currently hoarding to steal:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0x4d50471035d65810cdb9b34550d46b31bf398cb8\">https://bscscan.com/address/0x4d50471035d65810cdb9b34550d46b31bf398cb8</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>At time of writing, it holds over 24000 dollars. Once withdrawn, the addresses where he received the money can be seen under “Internal Tnxs”.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Head to:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bscscan.com/token/0x4d50471035d65810cdb9b34550d46b31bf398cb8#comments\">https://bscscan.com/token/0x4d50471035d65810cdb9b34550d46b31bf398cb8#comments</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>You’ll see someone accusing him of being involved in <a href=\"https://e-usd.network\">https://e-usd.network</a> scam.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Web archive:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210630184809/https://e-usd.network/\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210630184809/https://e-usd.network/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Here he withdrew near about 3500 BNBs:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bscscan.com/address/0xa1fd12820f0c1c492dd87f8a0d12043d8f24f8a6#internaltx\">https://bscscan.com/address/0xa1fd12820f0c1c492dd87f8a0d12043d8f24f8a6#internaltx</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Both the websites are an exact replica. And running metadata analysis, you can see that both websites were originally designed by a certain developer called M_Adnan whose code from <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/user/m_adnan\">https://themeforest.net/user/m_adnan</a> was used for illegal use.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I urge all crypto trading platforms to freeze his assets. Currently he’s involved in another  project <a href=\"https://moonvest.network/index.html\">https://moonvest.network/index.html</a>.</p>\n\n<p>webarchive:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210630162427/https://moonvest.network/\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210630162427/https://moonvest.network/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>He has publicly stated in Linkedin that he&#39;s involved in moonvest network, so putting its whitepaper through exiftool shows the exact same author “XXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXX” and both the whitepapers look exactly the same.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Report him to the authorities: USCIS, FTC, SEC, FBI, Seattle Police, all crypto trading platforms, Amazon(his employer), etc.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
