Have been in it since 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Even   though Bitcoin, Dogecoin and ETH are getting all the hype right now,  it  is important to learn about other players in the market with   potentially better tech.</p>\n\n<p>IOTA is a   direct competitor to ETH, ChainLink, XRP, NANO, LTC and Bitcoin. IOTA   was created to have no transaction fees and scale immensly.</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple advantages to IOTA when compared to other competitors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Fee-less</li>\n<li>Supported by non-profit foundation since 2017</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.iota.org/introducing-iota-oracles/\">Oracles, like Chainlink, it lets you upload an API to the ledger</a></li>\n<li>This DLT <a href=\"https://chrysalis.iota.org/\">is upgrading its platform to reusable addresses and UTXO</a>Switching to binary, getting rid of their hash algorithm for a commonplace one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.iota.org/iota-smart-contracts-pre-alpha-released-40efad27994b/\">They have planned tokenization and smart contracts.</a>Just like eth but the fundamental layer is free to use and has been tested sustain over 1000 confirmed transactions per seccond.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.iota.org/foundation/research-papers\">Supported by published research papers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://coordicide.iota.org/\">Coordicide</a>: Removal of coordinator</li>\n<li>Many partnerships including Eclipse and 11m€ grant with the German Ministry of Transportation and ETOGruppe</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unlike    many other cryptos, IOTA has zero fees. This is a major advantage   compared to other cryptos, especially since Bitcoin and Ethereum can get   really expensive really fast. Currently the fees for Eth and Btc  transactions are around $10. This is a major drawback for small everyday   transactions, microtransactions, data transfer or machiene to machiene  messages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IOTA is Eco-friendly</strong></p>\n\n<p>I    think this is a huge point that many people overlook. With the rise  of   Bitcoin, more and more power is dedicated to mining/processing    transactions, and at a certain point the cost of doing so will be    insane. With IOTA, thousands of transactions can happen at the same time    without the insane energy consumption that we are all used to seeing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>These    are just a few advantages that people should know about IOTA. If the   goal is to truly make a convenient crypto that lets people or machines   to freely transact and send messages, there is a strong argument for  the  IOTA token. Additionally, The IOTA Foundation has over 40 engineer  and even more employees. Good luck, thank you for reading this and happy  investing!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
