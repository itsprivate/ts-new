And in the event that crypto goes mainstream and most people start using it, I expect the same to happen to fiat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its dumb to assume that fiat will completely fade away into obscurity, but it will for sure be losing a lot of dominance in favor of crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this reality might not be too far away from happening. We’re already seeing things like crypto credit cards from platforms like Binance, Coinbase and CoinOvy gaining a lot of popularity in the mainstream market. These crypto-to-fiat bridges will give crypto a lot of exposure and help make the transition to full in crypto payments much easier and smoother.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
