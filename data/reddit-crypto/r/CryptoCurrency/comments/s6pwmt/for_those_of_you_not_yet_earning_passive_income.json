If you didn&amp;#39;t already know, there are a number of companies out there who will pay in-kind interest on your coins for doing nothing other than holding them on their platform. In-kind interest is one of the easiest ways to compound your investment and see exponential returns! So not only will you be earning interest on your coins while you wait for the price to moon, the interest you earn along the way will moon right along with it!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t take my word for it. Give it a go. Lower you average purchase price. Fatten your bags while you sleep. Stack your coins regardless of bear or bull or crab or shark or tadpole or beaver or flightless bird cycle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here is my &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;Interest Rates Comparison Tool&lt;/a&gt; for you to use, free of charge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about earning interest on your coins, questions about any of the platforms featured in this tool, questions about this tool, or really just crypto questions in general, I&amp;#39;m more than happy to talk through them with you! I&amp;#39;m happy to continue this thread or communicate via dm, whichever you&amp;#39;re more comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
