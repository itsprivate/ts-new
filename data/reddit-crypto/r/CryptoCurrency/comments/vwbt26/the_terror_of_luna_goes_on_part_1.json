The father had apparently invested his life savings on LUNA, and went bankrupt. He went on a fake vacation, deceiving his child and drugged her. Then there were reports of them missing, and the police department scouted the family, trying to track them down with CCTVs. In the end, they found their car in the bottom of the ocean, it was presumed that they committed suicide by purposefully driving their car into the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;\nArticle about this will be posted in the comment section  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There should be something done to Do Kwon and prevent rugpulls like this to happen. As of right now,  Do Kwon and LUNA employees are forbidden to leave the country.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo everyone, as a member of one of the biggest crypto community, help people out by posting warnings about scam projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
