  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creator of dogecoin, Billy Markus, is often called &amp;quot;salty&amp;quot; online. This is for good reason, he admits. He sees scammers making millions while he himself earned only a fraction on dogecoin. Dogecoin is consistently in the top 20 of all crypto currencies. The meme-coin was founded as a joke, but gained popularity for many different reasons. In the bull market of 2021, the coin rose from $0.01 to $0.74, an increase of over 7400%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcus didn&amp;#39;t get rich&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In particular, Elon &amp;quot;dogefather&amp;quot; Musk contributed to these increases. With tweets and rumors, he made sure that almost everyone was taken in by the currency. In this kind of action there are always winners and losers. So during this period, many people got rich from DOGE, but people also lost money. Billy Markus never really made himself rich with his creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/54x0rzltuxq81.png?width=554&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fcd32e4ccd644830ba88f6cce9ef9a42c2ac8436\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/54x0rzltuxq81.png?width=554&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fcd32e4ccd644830ba88f6cce9ef9a42c2ac8436&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;Of course I&amp;#39;m salty!&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;People always say I&amp;#39;m salty,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Markus tweeted. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Of course I&amp;#39;m salty! I made $3000 from a crypto with a market capitalization of $80 billion. Watching scammers make millions and strangers attack me all day. Who wouldn&amp;#39;t be salty?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;#39;m struggling, I&amp;#39;ve always been fine, except when I sold my crypto in 2015 to pay the rent. I&amp;#39;m just giving context to why so many things are so extra annoying; why it&amp;#39;s annoying that &amp;#39;entitled bastards&amp;#39; 8 years later say I should make them richer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;Create a dogecoin 2&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Marcus finds it hard that people hold him accountable for their portfolio, even though he himself had sold his crypto in 2015. A Twitter user shot in an idea to create &amp;#39;dogecoin 2&amp;#39; to make millions, but that is not possible according to Markus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r5ktwxazuxq81.png?width=562&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=33cc0d59bf556f34fbbe56c61dab4b07e76f7347\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/r5ktwxazuxq81.png?width=562&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=33cc0d59bf556f34fbbe56c61dab4b07e76f7347&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
