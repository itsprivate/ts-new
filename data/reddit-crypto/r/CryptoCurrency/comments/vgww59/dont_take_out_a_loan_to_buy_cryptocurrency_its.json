It is a good price if you have your own money to invest, borrowing money from a bank to invest in crypto even if it&amp;#39;s low APR% it&amp;#39;s not advisable and you shouldn&amp;#39;t do it. Losing your own money might sound bad, but imagine you&amp;#39;ve lost borrowed money, which you&amp;#39;ll have to pay back eventually. A simple quote that everybody heard a dozen times; don&amp;#39;t invest what you can&amp;#39;t afford to lose. Seems to me people still don&amp;#39;t get the principle of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can play around with your own money, nobody gives a f, if you lose it. Playing with borrowed money, not so much, it can f**k up your life in a variety of ways. You&amp;#39;ll owe more money in penalties, interest charges will get higher and your credit score will fall as well, not to mention mental problems that could come along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that being said, if you took a loan to invest in crypto, I wish you the best, also we&amp;#39;re looking forward to seeing your results, and I hope everything turns out well for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
