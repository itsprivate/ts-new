But for me it&amp;#39;s seems clear that he knowingly made this decision of going out forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During that time he disappeared, Bitcoin was picking up pace for the first time. Already the first big investments came in and it actually was seen as serious by some people. His work was done. He brought Bitcoin to the light and it was not his task to bring it further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of his disappearance, today no one is capable of criticising him as he basically does not exist. He left making Bitcoin truely neutral, there is no  &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; or maker that has any specific goals for this projects, it&amp;#39;s truely just us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
