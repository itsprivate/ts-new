Every once in awhile the old hubster will mention something about  &amp;quot;bitcoin tanking&amp;quot; and I manage to mutter a  &amp;quot;yeah it&amp;#39;s bad&amp;quot; and change the subject to college football or basketball. Or I just give the obligatory &amp;quot;I just hope the Kardashians are OK&amp;quot; type response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hasn&amp;#39;t said much about all the bank withdrawals and I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for it and am pretty sure I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;this close&amp;quot; to hearing about it so I quit putting money in. All I keep hearing is &amp;quot;tax time is going to be a bitch with all that crypto stuff your doing&amp;quot; and then as my kids say &amp;quot;butt clench time&amp;quot; but until then I guess I&amp;#39;ll keep moving things around and trying to make the red green and keep the rest as it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every once in awhile I see the &amp;quot;should I tell the wife&amp;quot; posts and ...idk...So...that got me thinking how much does she know? Or for the other 3 ladies and few gents with husbands in here does &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; know? It&amp;#39;s bad enough I&amp;#39;m on my phone in the middle of the night checking things...he&amp;#39;d probably be grateful if it was porn but nope...I&amp;#39;m such a nerd crypto is my side piece. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR - Does you SO know how much you&amp;#39;ve spent/made in crypto? You gonna tell them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: So, our relationship is good, 23 yrs strong.  We are financially sound and own everything. I&amp;#39;m talking less than 10k. The post was brought on by the downturn where I&amp;#39;m down about 40% and it&amp;#39;s more about being perceived as making a bad investment decision and not wanting to talk about it. I&amp;#39;m not hiding it but he hasn&amp;#39;t asked and I&amp;#39;m not bringing it up. BTW, he&amp;#39;s not perfect either. I&amp;#39;ve also seen a lot of &amp;quot;should I tell the wife&amp;quot; questions and that&amp;#39;s why I asked where everyone&amp;#39;s at ...pure curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
