I got into crypto in 2012, when I bought 27 bitcoins for around 300 dollars (or something like that, can&#39;t quite remember it), and if only I&#39;d held onto them for almost 9 years! But the reality is, I used them all in various online games, ponzi schemes and what not. So don&#39;t worry scammers, they are long gone.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine if I held onto those coins. Imagine if I had a fuckload of money. Would that have made me happy? In hindsight, no. Back then I was young, insecure, without many friends and without any love in my life. Now I have a girlfriend (soon to be wife) and two kids. If I had held onto those coins for god knows how long and if I had been rich enough to go onto another path in life, I wouldn&#39;t have met her. I wouldn&#39;t have gotten my beautiful children.</p>\n\n<p>So friends, accept your fate in life and let that regret go away. Your time is now. Invest in your future.</p>\n\n<p>Keep calm, DCA and carry on.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
