I invest for fun not ever expecting to make any life-changing money. I’m not trying to shill anything just curious. NANO seems to be wildly polarizing; people either love it or hate it. This leads me to several questions:</p>\n\n<p>People who love NANO, how can you still love it when it hasn’t moved much in price since it crashed in 2017. What kept you interested?</p>\n\n<p>People who hate NANO, why do you think NANO is not a viable investment option? </p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I know very little when it comes to crypto. I browse the boards and do a little reading but I’m just trying to educate myself still at this point.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
