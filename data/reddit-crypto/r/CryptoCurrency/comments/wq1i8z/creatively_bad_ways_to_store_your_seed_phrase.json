There are tried and true methods to store your seed like a metal engraving, steel capsule, or on an air gapped computer (not connected to the internet).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, over the years, you see some creative methods that are truly unique, but for one reason or another won’t work for long-term storage. Here’s a list of the best bad ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using a gameboy/gba, change the names of your Pokémon to your seed phrase, ordered by how they are numbered in your Pokédex.  Just on&amp;#39;t lose your game or let the cartridge battery die. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buy a Webster&amp;#39;s dictionary. Find all your seed words and put the corresponding order number next to each word. Need to find your seed phrase? Just read the entire dictionary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Acquire 24 cats. Name them after your seed phrase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complete a 2500 piece jigsaw puzzle. Write bits of your seed across the back of the puzzle.  Take the puzzle apart and put it back in the box.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engrave them on your cold wallet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build a creative-mode world on minecraft. Write your seed into landscapes or buildings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any more terrible but creative ways to store your seed phrase?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
