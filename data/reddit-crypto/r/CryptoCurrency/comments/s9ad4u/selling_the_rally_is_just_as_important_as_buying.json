I won&amp;#39;t be surprised if some people didn&amp;#39;t take profits just for the fear of having &amp;quot;Paper hands&amp;quot;.\nI can&amp;#39;t vouch for other communities cause I just lurk around in this sub, and you will agree with me when I say that this community scorns those who even &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; of taking profits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I can bet that a lot of people here regret not listening to their &lt;strong&gt;own intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; and taking some sweet profits before the big red hit us all this year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We chant &amp;quot;Buy the dip&amp;quot; everyday in this sub, hell even in the entire crypto world, but never have I heard someone say &amp;quot;Sell the rally&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here I am, giving you all a heads up for the inevitable crypto rally this year:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is OKAY to take some PROFITS !&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is OKAY to be able to sleep at night with no regrets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is OKAY to miss some extra green because you didn&amp;#39;t want to risk it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, everyone who has been there in the crypto market books profit every now and then, they just keep it a secret. And all the newbies fall for the trap called &amp;quot;HODL till death&amp;quot;. Just don&amp;#39;t do that. Hodl isn&amp;#39;t some holy grail you need to abide by all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DCA and HODL is definitely a very smart strategy to invest in good projects, but don&amp;#39;t forget to get your family something nice with crypto profits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case you fear missing out on huge pumps, best hodl &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; while booking profits on a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; percentage of your bag. This is a win-win situation where you minimize both risk and regrets while still HODLing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, If you have extra money, Buy the Dip fellas!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
