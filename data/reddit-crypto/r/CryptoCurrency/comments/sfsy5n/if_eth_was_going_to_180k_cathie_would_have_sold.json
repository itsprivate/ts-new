Forget ETH, I would be more than happy if the whole crypto market cap was that much by 2030.\nThe only way this could happen is if the US dollar loses massive value and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s possible for that to happen to a degree like in Venezuela, Argentina or even Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love my Hopium as much as the next guy but be sure not to overdose on that fucker.
