Both are the only two I hold and am wondering if this may be beneficial overall if BTC sees a similar upwards run in the near future. I&amp;#39;m not very certain of this but I don&amp;#39;t know how much longer this upward trend can last for especially since we&amp;#39;re in a recession and growth like that is hard to find. Perhaps wait until the merge ? Or will there be a sell off because of staking? Or another trend up because the merge was successful? I&amp;#39;m all ears on the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
