But there may be some ill feeling in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Musk’s dalliance with crypto has seen him in the Twitter spotlight since the crypto market began soaring to all-time highs early last year, and he has remained prolific in his commentary on Bitcoin and other tokens that are now, thanks in large measure to his influence, well known.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has been sued multiple times by shareholders of his own companies and others — including Twitter — over potentially market-moving tweets, which have been described as “erratic,” among other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet Musk’s purchase of Twitter has now given him a bigger megaphone than ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What Musk’s latest acquisition means for the crypto space, however, is moot, although it is abundantly clear that his conduct has alienated many in the community, and he has been accused of treating crypto investors like playthings as the values of their portfolios have undergone wild swings amid the caprice of his Twitter messaging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This man is truly unstoppable and humanity should be looking forward to his exploration of Mars in 2029. If you ever wondered how Elon Musk would look like if he got attacked by aliens on Mars, there is a good representation of this portrayed by Mutant Musks NFT. I found it quite intriguing as an NFT veteran.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What will Elon do next?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
