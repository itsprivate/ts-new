I bought BTC, ETH and LTC each at 33% of the portfolio and then logged out. I pretty much treated it like a long term stock purchase and checked it maybe once or twice a month.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually I realized everything was up and was actually doing very well... so then I decided to try and GET EDUCATED.</p>\n\n<p>I started reading <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> and researching like crazy on ALT coins. I learned about 2017, this bull market, coin dominance, 50 day avgs, DeFi, NFTS, shards, 2.0&#39;s, 3.0&#39;s, rug pulls and on and on....</p>\n\n<p>This led me to firmly believe that a bear market was coming &quot;soonish&quot; (whatever that means) and that I needed to find a way to &quot;max extract&quot; from the market as quickly as possible... while it was &quot;good&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This is when I turned into a Moron...</p>\n\n<p>I was jumping in on Alts and getting stuck when they dipped... always found myself waiting for rebounds to jump to the next bog... Mostly I just worked really hard to stay even...</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong... I hit some big gains but then would slowly see much of it disappear through an inefficient process of chasing falling boulders up big hills. I was making money... <em>for the exchanges.</em></p>\n\n<p>Then I would read this thread every day and whether it was full of panic, party or moons it would encourage me down the rabbit hole further. (<em>Probably My fault</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Turns out... for me. It pays to just DYOR, buy 5-6 coins you see long term potential in... set some Stop Orders if you are super worried about protecting a big gain and leave it alone. Sure take some profits at some point but at least for me... when I play the game too hard... it seems to just play me.</p>\n\n<p>Just M2C and a reminder there is nothing wrong with keeping it simple.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
