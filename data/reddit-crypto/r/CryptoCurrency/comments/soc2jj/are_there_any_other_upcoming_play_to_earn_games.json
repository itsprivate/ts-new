(I’m not gonna use it as my main source of income so don’t come at me) Anyways, Here are some of the games that I have found.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Metawars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m that early with this one. I was hoping for phase one, but I think this will be enough. I&amp;#39;m hoping the graphics aren&amp;#39;t too bad considering we will be exploring planets and battling other players. (It’s kinda like star atlas? lol) I’m wondering how much the planets will cost alsoooooo, it’s a multiplayer game which is kinda intriguing but still kinda skeptic about this.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Wrejects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI’m looking forward to this one too. Wrestling and aliens are the perfect combination for me. Still thinking if the graphics when wrestling will be good. I’m really realllyyy looking forward to the gameplay but It’s still on Q1 so there’s nothing much info out there. Every fighter, like in other PVP games, has their own backstory and unique special move. Also, unlike in Metawars, the team is doxxed.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;3. My Neighbor Alice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nNot early enough with this one too but this is a pretty wholesome game. It’s an open world game kinda like animal crossing? I wasn’t able to join the pre-alpha access but seeing the gameplay was enough for me. I can see myself spending hours playing this, just like I did with AC also, It’s on steam which is a plus for me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts about the games that I mentioned?&lt;br/&gt;\nPs. still new to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
