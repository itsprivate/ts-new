  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So just for kicks I was wondering this. And not this isn&amp;#39;t an exact science since factors can change the numbers a bit, and before digging into this I&amp;#39;m figuring you would already have to have a ton of money where you aren&amp;#39;t worried about this anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note when I say passive income to live off of, I don&amp;#39;t mean high income as a laundromat chain (which btw from what I hear is one of the best methods at passive income in a normal way). IMO livable wage would be about $35k a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;HNT mining:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HNT mining is a bit different from normal mining, but IMO it might be one of the easier methods since you&amp;#39;re just setting up a radio system and not dealing with GPU and other things. But at the same time, this might not be possible depending on your location and ability. Like lets say if I own a ton of rentals, I would look at this. Depending on the distance you could setup a number of HNT miners, and make money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at the numbers. Again, this depends on your location, equipment, and so on. But what some are reporting is about 0.2 HNT (roughly $4 right now) per day per miner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each miner is about $500&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So 4*365=$1,460 per year per miner. $35k/$1,460=23.9 miners 24*500= &lt;strong&gt;$12,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, this means you need to find a place to put 24 miners, get it all working, and so on. Just the location will rule out many.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something to note, IMO I don&amp;#39;t think this is a good long term option. I think like normal GPU miners this will dramatically decrease amount earn over time, and many are waiting a solid year before getting their miners after ordering them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;GPU mining:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like before, this highly depends on a number of factors. And note the $ is going to focus on the GPU cost and not motherboard, electric, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off you can go to the following to pull up whatever numbers &lt;a href=\"https://whattomine.com/\"&gt;https://whattomine.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be using a 3090 GPU as an example here and we will be looking at current ETH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t5pl0bq0dcn81.png?width=1824&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5235c551540645854b34ca9c24030bec10f73b59\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Per 3090 you&amp;#39;re looking at roughly $4.61 per day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Price per 3090 right now it looks like it averages around $2,300 per.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$4.61*365=$1,682.65 per year. $35k/$1,682.65=20.8 GPU. 21*$2,300= &lt;strong&gt;$48,300&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something to note is I think POW is going out the door slowly. There most likely will always be some coin like RVN that allows for this. But there is obviously a strong push for POS because of the green stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note is it is likely GPU prices will dramatically drop in a few years. The biggest chip manufacture is moving to USA AZ to get away from China due to political reasons. They mention something like 2024 or 2025 before getting everything fully running and setup. But they are moving a lot faster than expected. Still, I expect by 2025 we will see a massive drop in price in chip prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Staking and DeFi/yield farming:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it appears POS is where things are going. You can get different rates. Most aim for around 9% at max because keep in mind staking rewards are inflating (lowering the value of the coin) since it is making new coins like mining does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get a good overview you can go to &lt;a href=\"https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/usdt/\"&gt;https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/usdt/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and note when the coin goes up in price this can make it where you need less staked. But because math and I don&amp;#39;t have a working crystal ball. I am just assuming the price is stable from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So lets say 9% staking rewards per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$35k/0.09= &lt;strong&gt;$388,888.89&lt;/strong&gt;. Meaning you need to stake $389k worth of coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Defi &lt;a href=\"https://www.stakingrewards.com/defi/\"&gt;https://www.stakingrewards.com/defi/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Defi the % you need to aim for the most as possible since you&amp;#39;re not creating new coins which means you&amp;#39;re not lowering the value by doing it. But just do the math and you can quickly figure it out. But lets just say you need an easy quarter of a million dollars staking or more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Reflections:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with reflections this is extremely hard to figure out since unlike the others this highly depends on others. How reflections work is when people buy, sell, or transfer the given coin. Part of the transfer fee goes to everyone. So this means when someone does anything with the coin, then you get a little. The amount you get depends on the transaction fee size, the amount of coins out there, and how many coins you hold. So it is impossible to figure out prior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT in my experience it looks like you get around 2% per year. Note things like Safemoon and other things are looking at having reasons for using the coin. Like attaching it with a debt card or whatever. And when that happens that should in theory massively increase that % per year. But for the here and now, I would expect something like 2% a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$35k/0.02= &lt;strong&gt;$1,750,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO this will be more worth while years down the road if a coin with this gets more of a use to use it, and you aren&amp;#39;t depending on just trading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Bots:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a side thing and just in my experience. I was getting 5% ROI with grid bots. Something like 3commas is about $600 a year. And note you will have a metric ton of transactions so you need to look into if you need an accountant and the tax tracking software like Koinly. Like when I say a metric ton of transactions, we are talking about 40k transactions per month or more. And the aim of gains per sell is 10 cents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO I think your goal on this should be more $50k+ in returns per year since you will be spending a chunk of that in keeping yourself safe with the IRS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$50k/0.05= &lt;strong&gt;$1M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as you can tell, this is a rich person&amp;#39;s game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
