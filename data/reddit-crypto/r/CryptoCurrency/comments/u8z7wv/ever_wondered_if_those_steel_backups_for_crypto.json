  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a small brand of stainless steel crypto backups and recently I put my most popular one inside a ceramic furnace for 12 hours straight, with a peak temperature of 1150 °C (2102 °F) which lasted 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My backup works by converting each word of your seedphrase into its equivalent number using the BIP39 Standard, a static pool of 2048 words. Then you just grab a hammer or mallet and stamp the sequence of numbers into the plate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original wordlist: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt\"&gt;https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead of shipping 27 alphabetical stamps I just ship 9 numerical stamps (6=9).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use AISI 304 Stainless Steel which has a melting point of 1450 °C (2642 °F) so I knew it would not melt, this was rather intended to be an endurance test against high temperature for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y9kdtkx8gyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=433320839d54fb23e72ce73aff1ca6e83ad60522\"&gt;Fully stamped plate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8gdcdt6dgyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f1fa5398e59eeb5c16e14f45953e90e8f358f3cc\"&gt;Macro shot of the stamped numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so one of my dad&amp;#39;s friends runs a ceramics factory which manufactures Raku (his name is Juan), and he was kind enough to let me put one of my plates in one of the furnaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;April 12 at 6:30 am the test had begun&lt;/strong&gt;, the furnace was on. Juan told me the peak temperature was gonna be reached at around 4:30 pm so I went to the factory at that time to photograph the live  furnace and and the thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that the furnace was turned off at 6:00 pm but remained closed until the next morning at 9:00 am, an extra 15 hours which I do not have the graph for, but it&amp;#39;s safe to say it remained very hot inside the furnace for a good few hours after it was turned off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ve4i58e3hyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=69b090de8604e2b4df8e8ff37e6581c48d988e1a\"&gt;The live furnace.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/avitsx74hyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7ec197cad26e0802fe6f73bfd8fc8553b2f35e96\"&gt;Peak temperature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ls025646hyu81.png?width=952&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=202a7f547f608980026044c447534bbcfe5cb0f3\"&gt;Temperature graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;April 13 at 9:00 am the test had concluded&lt;/strong&gt;, the furnace was practically at ambient temperature. The first pic was taken by Juan when they first opened the furnace. I got really anxious because you can barely see any marks on the plates so for a moment I thought they were completely done. I arrived at 11:30 am to the factory only to be surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vo2s0m5yhyu81.jpg?width=1512&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=16667d2625c92ecb52b997ad7fda3e5a686d39df\"&gt;First pic after opening the furnace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j4fiobibiyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cac74ca0890d9a21706ed2196559df1fb48b20a7\"&gt;Front and back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f6saqvdciyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3c0094e64ae6af465c823ca6e8ea2493bfeea6bf\"&gt;Close up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pltszrwciyu81.jpg?width=4592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=94c821a379f2b35880005c89fbf8adf659578c76\"&gt;Macro shot of the stamped numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Result &amp;amp; Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The backup data was fully recovered, you can see all the numbers because the steel has almost all of its integrity even after being burned down for half a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After carefully reviewing both burned plates and the nature of this benchmark, I came to the conclusion that this test was a total success. I like that this ended up being an extreme endurance test that really shows the strength of the steel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no secret, if the furnace would have reached a temperature of 1450 °C (2642 &lt;strong&gt;°&lt;/strong&gt;F) both plates would have melted and redeemed irrecoverable. But realistically speaking, in what scenario would these crazy temperatures be reached? The average house fire temperature oscillates between 600 °C  and 800 °C (1100 &lt;strong&gt;°&lt;/strong&gt;F - 1500 &lt;strong&gt;°&lt;/strong&gt;F). &lt;a href=\"https://firefighterinsider.com/house-fire-temperature-how-hot-does-it-get/\"&gt;Source 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://jacksonvillesafe.com/2019/07/do-you-know-what-will-not-burn-in-a-house-fire/\"&gt;Source 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not claim to be an expert in house fires but I firmly believe that 12 hours of high temperature is a long amount of time and proves that this grade of steel is suitable for this kind of application.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear everyone&amp;#39;s opinion on my test, was it good enough? I do believe it simulates a severe house fire. If you have any cool ideas for other benchmarks against steel!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full article: &lt;a href=\"https://cryptonumeris.com/blogs/cryptonumeris/stress-test-1\"&gt;https://cryptonumeris.com/blogs/cryptonumeris/stress-test-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
