It also could start pumping and if you don&amp;#39;t continue to DCA you&amp;#39;ll miss the chance to average down those ATH buy in prices you probably entered the market with. The market is already almost 50% down, even if it dips further this is still a great price point to be buying in on almost all coins in terms of risk / reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is that take two massive piles of table salt whenever anyone tries to tell you they are anything other than &amp;#39;guessing&amp;#39; what the market is going to do. Ignore all the &amp;#39;TA&amp;#39; and the graphs and the political rumours and hearsay and don&amp;#39;t worry about the stock markets. They have been telling me that the stock markets are about to crash any day now for over a year and the FTSE just keeps on reaching new post-COVID highs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So invest wisely and DO research and make informed opinions but also filter out the doomsayers and the market crash predicters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
