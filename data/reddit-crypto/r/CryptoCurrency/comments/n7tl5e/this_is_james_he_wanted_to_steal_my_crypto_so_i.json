  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><em>tl;dr: I like messing with scammers who contact me after seeing me on this sub. I did it, for example, with</em> <em>Paul</em> <em>and</em> <em>martins by name</em> <em>(just  look at my top posts, I can&#39;t link them for some reason). I convinced  this guy that he was being scammed by someone else and tracked his IP  and told him where he was and where he worked. It was fun (and maybe my  best one yet), the conversation is here in four parts (for readability):</em> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/enWqEom\"><em>one</em></a><em>,</em> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/80gRHMb\"><em>two</em></a><em>,</em> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ELumfgO\">three</a> and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/e8qfv4x\">four</a></p>\n\n<p>Whenever    an new account with barely any content sends me a message  and offers   me  an investment opportunity, I know what to do: answer,  confirm  that  yes,  I want to take it urgently and yes, I believe  absolutely   everything the  person tells me.</p>\n\n<p>Since   I started  posting here more regularly I, like I guess most of  you,  am  getting many  such messages. So when James here contacted me  today,  I  thought I knew  the script already: copy trading. His profile  was  cute,  only one post,  titled &quot;I am happy with the kind of man I   am😌🙏&quot; with a  few pictures of  some guy, posted to his own profile. I   decided to use  these pictures.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/enWqEom\">It started out as always</a>,  he just wants to share some ideas, I am very enthusiastic about     everything and try to get him to the scam ASAP. And I guessed right,     copy trading. I even tried to guess the site - the one the last scammer     wanted to get me to - but it seems my guess was wrong in that case,  he    has a different scam site. Oops!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/80gRHMb\">But he didn&#39;t care that much</a>,  his site was 100% profit guaranteed, so that sounded good. I asked  him    for the scam link, he didn&#39;t like that, but I told him that was a     translation error from Belgian (I&#39;m not from Belgium and Belgian is  not  a language, lol) which was good enough for him. He told me that he  is    scared of scammers, but then we went on and he sent me the scam  link.  So   far so good, he wanted a screenshot of my registration (The     WhatsApp-thing in this part goes back to the first time I talked to a  scammer, <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ms1vsf/this_sub_is_riddled_with_scammers_but_sometimes/\">Paul</a>, who really liked Whatsapp).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ELumfgO\">Then the fun began</a>,  and I think this is my best work yet: I uploaded one of the pictures  from his profile and sent him a traceable link. I titled it &quot;my crush&quot;  on imgur and was disappointed at first, because he didn&#39;t notice that  was &quot;him&quot; (I guess he just stole    the pictures somewhere, that&#39;s why  I&#39;m not linking them). He didn&#39;t    understand what he was seeing and  asked for the right screenshot, I just    registered on GitHub (first  bookmark I had open) and changed the html    code a bit. that one seemed  to be fine with him. Then he noticed,  that   the first picture was  &quot;him&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/e8qfv4x\">As I had his IP</a>  and it was registered for a company (I censored it in red), him   getting   nervous was really funny, but read the rest for yourself (by   the way,   the number i sent him is absolutely not his, but another   scammer from a   few days ago, so he is fake-panicking in that case).</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/james_beckman/comments/mlklfg/i_am_happy_with_the_kind_of_man_i_am/\">he&#39;s still mad at me :(</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit2: turns out, the scammer just stole and used pictures of Madalin Ionescu, a Romanian tv show host (thanks <a href=\"/u/belemihai\">u/belemihai</a> for pointing this out!), so that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t immediately notice the picture I sent was &quot;him&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
