  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is the most secure network in existence. The way the network is built is pure genius and the bigger it gets, the more secure it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Dan Kaminsky, a leading Internet-security researcher, investigated the currency and was sure he would find major weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kaminsky is famous among hackers for discovering, in 2008, a fundamental flaw in the Internet which would have allowed a skilled coder to take over any Web site or even to shut down the Internet. Kaminsky alerted the Department of Homeland Security and executives at Microsoft and Cisco to the problem and worked with them to patch it. He is one of the most adept practitioners of “penetration testing,” the art of compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who want to know their vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guess what he said when he tried to break Bitcoin?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When I first looked at the code, I was sure I was going to be able to break it. The way the whole thing was formatted was insane. Only the most paranoid, painstaking coder in the world could avoid making mistakes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He thought he had identified nine ways to compromise the system and scoured Nakamoto’s code for an insertion point for his first attack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when he found the right spot, there was a message waiting for him. “Attack Removed,” it said. The same thing happened over and over, infuriating Kaminsky. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I came up with beautiful bugs. But every time I went after the code there was a line that addressed the problem.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was like a burglar who was certain that he could break into a bank by digging a tunnel, drilling through a wall, or climbing down a vent, and on each attempt he discovered a freshly poured cement barrier with a sign telling him to go home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’ve never seen anything like it,”&lt;/em&gt; Kaminsky said, still in awe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Either there’s a team of people who worked on this or this guy is a genius.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: Buy Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/the-crypto-currency/\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
