Also the job in tech is internal tools dev at a medium sized game publisher. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep. I think about this constantly, I understand the use case for something like Bitcoin. Transfer money with no middle men. I get that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the hell are these other chains supposed to be doing? Half my damn portfolio is Ethereum and I genuinely can&amp;#39;t tell you what your supposed to do with it. Why would you develop an app on a Blockchain? Let alone how. Is there some inherent benefit here? God I have no clue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the longest time I just thought it was like providing a decentralized version of something like AWS or Azure, like a grass roots server host. Holy shit I was wrong. There&amp;#39;s all sorts of shit you can make apparently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah idk. Feels good to come clean. I got into it cause it seemed like a smart investment and so far so good. But I&amp;#39;m amazed I&amp;#39;ve not come across any real application of it in my day to day life so far that I&amp;#39;m aware of at least. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot be alone here right? Please. It&amp;#39;s wild to me that I understand more about the idea behind what an NFT is (supposed to be) used for than any application of any other blockchains. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk if anyone else is in this camp and feels dumb you&amp;#39;re not alone. I feel ya.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
