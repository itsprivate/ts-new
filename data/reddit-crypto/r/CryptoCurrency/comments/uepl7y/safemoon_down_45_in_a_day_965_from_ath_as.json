  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weirdly enough, the previous two videos detailing extraordinary allegations, with proof, on the massive scale of fraud that permeates Safemoon didn&amp;#39;t seem to do it, but the truth from the latest video has finally sunk in, with a top whale selling off four Billion tokens (worth nearly $2m).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5b2f84b56d66f807cf5aa8f05ba8848875dba3a19f7a4c33717bae6182e90874\"&gt;Transaction 1&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0xde60375cf511084a1b1f17841f26a06050b30cde0d7b7a9f46a02d4c675e56d3\"&gt;Transaction 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIUrE7Ovm5k\"&gt;Coffeezilla&amp;#39;s latest video&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one is much quicker, snappier, and devastating.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gist of it is that the Safemoon community has spent the last week and a half fervently denying that the wallets Coffee speculated were CEO John Karony&amp;#39;s was a personal wallet, and therefore the movements in and out of the liquidity pools and receiving large payments from Bitmart etc were all kosher.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone tipped Coffee off to &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; pump-and-dump scheme organised by Ben Phillips, where Karony spent $300,000 on shitcoins. Ben Phillips also was part of some Hotdog NFT bullshit, and Karony mentioned he liked one publicly on twitter... that very safe NFT is owned by a wallet that Coffee uncovers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The video does a much better job of explaining it than I do, but we&amp;#39;re in the Endgame now fellas.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My RES tags on Reddit have been pulling overtime with all the people I&amp;#39;ve tagged as &amp;quot;Safemoon Cultist&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do they have to say? Let&amp;#39;s find out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whale sold. Watch this dip get eaten.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Awwww. Just because you lost YOUR life savings and are butter hurt, doesn&amp;#39;t mean everyone else is. Don&amp;#39;t be mad... once FOMO hits, you&amp;#39;ll be back.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please stop buying bro karoney is stealing 100 trillion money i saw on ioutube truste me please stop ✋ 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have less whales than most crypto tokens. Just check babscan!  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, if you would have paid attention you would know that when the youtuber posted his first video the price went down 25%... this time he posted and the price stayed pretty much the same. That&amp;#39;s all  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(That one aged like milk on a hot Texas day)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Why isn’t my fud working? Why aren’t they selling? Time to make up more shit!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If it is a rug pull, would it be logical to spent 1 mln on a bill board, hire top qualified personnel, launch wallet, work on exchange, blockchain, card, websites, cross chain, etc. Would you start a LLC with liability, would you doxx, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I haven’t watched any of his videos. Don’t need to  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stopped reading at copy and paste wallet, that&amp;#39;s a marching order term right there&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fairly confident that this will be remembered as Safemoon&amp;#39;s low point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this is all fud to make the price drop on purpose 😉&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we have a mixed bag really. Most of the people who haven&amp;#39;t already sold are just sticking their heads in the sand but the mounting volume of proof is starting to resonate with more and more people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s still quite a sizeable portion of people that think a turnaround is about to happen... So I guess let&amp;#39;s sit back, crack open the popcorn and keep watching this incredible shit-show.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
