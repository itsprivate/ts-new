  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I talked to a lot of boomers lately to explain Bitcoin to them, as well as to hear their thoughts on it, and to my surprise, they actually listened for the first time in almost a decade of trying to help their generations understand it. Many even said that they had heard about it from their friends and were in the process of trying to better understand it to learn how to invest in it. To be honest, I had given up hope on their generation a long time ago after always getting completely shut down every single time in the past when I tried to explain Bitcoin to them. But now, every single one I&#39;ve talked to about it so far has said that they are going to start selling some stocks for Bitcoin, and a few boomers said that they&#39;ll sell all their stocks and bonds, and even divert new future investments into Bitcoin. These guys have the assets to put in hundreds of thousands, to millions of dollars into the market, but if they all start trying to buy at once, they will spike the market like we&#39;ve never seen before. The demand among their generation is in the trillions if even just 10% of their wealth FOMOs in, and every old retired dude with assets that I know of at the moment is waiting for a dip to buy themselves some serious amount of coins. If this is even just 5% of their wealth goes in with people in their demographic now starting considering an investment in Bitcoin, then that&#39;s a hell of a lot of demand with trillions of dollars in assets to sell for Bitcoin. If they&#39;re anything like most others who hopped into Bitcoin for their first time, then they will likely begin an avalanche of fomo&#39;ing in if Bitcoin starts running up in price to create new all-time highs. There&#39;s no coincidence that gold lost 10 percent of its market cap and Bitcoin went up by that same amount of value in its market cap. And that was just the early wave of boomers. You can only imagine how fast this news is spreading amongst their generation already in the age of the internet, and how much faster it will continue to spread after they make some serious returns from the next wave up they&#39;ll likely be causing. Just imagine how much louder they&#39;ll be with their friends about it after that. Mark my words, I bet you&#39;ll start seeing your grandparents, parents, aunts, and uncles talking about Bitcoin on Facebook soon. Will likely make for some fun threads to share here when they do</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>TL;dr I saw headlines saying boomers were getting into crypto; I called bullshit and went to ask every boomer I knew about Bitcoin to confirm, and after every conversation I had, they all said they&#39;re going to start selling some stocks and bonds to start buying some Bitcoin. Some even said they&#39;ll be selling all their stocks and bonds if they have to to get some substantial amounts of coins, as well as diverting their future revenue into Bitcoin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Edit: Adding numbers for the 5% of boomer wealth adoption equaling potentially trillions in USD value claim. Global wealth is estimated at around $360.6 trillion, and boomers own 53% of that according to the data online, so that would mean they own something like $191.11 trillion, so 5% of that would be $9.55 trillion. Enough to get Bitcoin past $511k per coin today if you divide that market cap by the 18.676 million coins that have been mined today. If 10% of their wealth adopts, then that&#39;s enough to get Bitcoin past $1.02 million.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
