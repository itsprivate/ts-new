They will lie even hours before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now what is happening is cascading margin calls and liquidations occurring just like during the 2007-2008 wallstreet/banking crisis. The big difference is crypto exchanges do not offer SIPC/FDIC insurance so when the doors close you lose everything you worked for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way to protect yourself is to withdraw assets and put them in cold storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now a tsunami is washing over the entire exchange industry and its only a matter of time before you lose what you have deposited with them. Don’t be lazy or distracted now is the time to protect what you worked for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
