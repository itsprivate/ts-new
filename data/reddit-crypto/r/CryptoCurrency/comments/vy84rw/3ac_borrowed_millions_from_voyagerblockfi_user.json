Infact till April, they were buying up all the junk NFTs using the funds borrowed from retail investors via Voyager, BlockFi, and any other centralised lender that was happy to lend to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They bought &lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6cca8635f02eb5c14fa66722392a49ae45152bc40f39bef6741ea04054b8a857\"&gt;this one for 800 eth worth over $2m&lt;/a&gt; at the time, and another one called &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc71aac6eec93e86a0e13b7bc15773ac95b51c822a2054ce96b20fbbc81b36ecf\"&gt;Arnolfrini Shrimp&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; for $130k!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that these companies like  Voyager kept lending out their customer&amp;#39;s deposits to 3AC, who then used it to gamble degenerately on useless NFTs is utterly bewildering. Didnt they have any internal controls that would point out that the funds are being diverted to NFTs, when the bear market had already started?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
