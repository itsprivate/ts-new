They could be bad or good for all I know. But one thing is for certain, these guys are really smart. </p>\n\n<p>A service where each coin is backed by an actual dollar?  That simply means it can never be worth that much less than a dollar.</p>\n\n<p>They basically figured out how to be an exchange without actually being an exchange.  They just let other exchanges do all the work for them.  They take a really tiny fraction of the fees to use it, and simply reinvest it into a bank, and for each $1 profit put back to the bank creates another tether.  The trading volume is always consistently high.  They will keep growing and growing and growing.\nIf they are allowed to still operate , and crypto sticks around for another few decades they might eventually take the number one away from BTC at $1ea</p>\n\n<p>I personally believe they started off inflated, gained money fast, and was able to reinvest back in before anyone could audit. But who knows. That&#39;s what I like to think. I&#39;m happy that way. 😆</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Hshare</strong> #28</h2>\n\n<p>Gone.\nNot sure where they went. Did they change their name?

Doesn&#39;t mean they will all die, and many of these older ones are still in the top 200</p>\n\n<p>Just simply means your long term HODLs outside of the top 10 have a 55-60% chance of not working out well for big gains. </p>\n\n<p>That only makes sense.  </p>\n\n<p>As of now we don&#39;t need 1000 Different Cryptos yet.  So you better believe many on top today won&#39;t be here another day. What we need privacy, it&#39;s our #1 concern really.</p>\n\n<p>We need digital to protect against centralized fractional reserve banking that makes your $1 worth $0.01ea, and of course infinite scalability.</p>\n\n<p>We will always need Altcoins.  BTC is great gold king, and will always be that way I believe.  However, those dam gas fees. Even eth. </p>\n\n<p>The more adoption we get the more alts will be needed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
