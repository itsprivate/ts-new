(For some reason, it was locked, I never found out why).*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have three kids, M**, A** and E**. I bought them each $100 worth of cryptos of their choice and will give them the entire investment when they turn 18. I let them make their choices based on whatever reasons they wanted. All I did was show them the top 100 list from coinmarketcap.These are their allocations and reasons for each decision:&lt;strong&gt;M** (9yrs old, boy): ETH, THETA, ADA.&lt;/strong&gt; He really loved the black diamond and thought the other two had nice aesthetic designs.&lt;strong&gt;A** (7 yrs old, girl): ETH, AAVE, CRV.&lt;/strong&gt; She also loved the black diamond, the AAVE has her favourite colour and starts with the same letter as her first name, CRV has a pretty rainbow.&lt;strong&gt;E** (4 yrs old, girl): UNI, ENJ, CAKE.&lt;/strong&gt; She loves unicorns and therefore, loves UNI. The ENJ logo has a very pretty E for her name. CAKE because she loves pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
