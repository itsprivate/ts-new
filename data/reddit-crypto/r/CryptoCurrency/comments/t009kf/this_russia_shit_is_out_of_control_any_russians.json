Does crypto factor into this for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) In your opinion, what would the best outcome for Russia be in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) If you could move to any country on the planet (including staying in Russia) where would you go? Would crypto factor into your decision?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize you might fear for your lives in answering these questions honestly but I am genuinely curious and if you are brave enough to answer honestly you might get a few moons as a tip.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
