For a while, the exchange was doing fine and users would receive their fee splits. The exchange wasn&#39;t really gaining traction so the former founder, Rune Evenson, sold the exchange in 2020 so it could be merged with an Indian project called ARAX wallet.</p>\n\n<p>Things seemed to be going ok and the company actually made improvements to the exchange during this time period. There was a good amount of communication about what was going on so it didn&#39;t quite seem like an exit scam <em>yet</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One troubling slip was that after the exchange was acquired, they sent out emails with a footer now showing that they were located in the British Virgin Islands under &quot;COSS Asset Management Limited Intershore Chambers, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands.&quot; Formerly, they were located at 68 Tras St, Singapore 079007.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, what was really happening was that the new group was in the process of stealing all of their user&#39;s funds.</p>\n\n<p>Since the merger, all user funds have been put &quot;in audit&quot; while they are moved from the old exchange wallets to the new exchange wallets. My funds have been &quot;in audit&quot; for over a year and if you message the support staff, you receive the same canned response every single time.</p>\n\n<p>The exchange was quick to audit and release everyone&#39;s COS tokens so that we could cash out our now-worthless COS tokens. They still have yet to release any actual worthwhile cryptocurrency though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The exchange stole 17 ETH, 80k REQ, and 764 DAI from me and I don&#39;t intend to let that go without a fight.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If there&#39;s anyone here with connections in Singapore or The British Virgin Islands that can track these fuckers down and help me bring them to justice then <strong>I will give you half of whatever funds can be recovered.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve already sent messages to different law enforcement groups in the BVI and Singapore but I could still use help making this public.</p>\n\n<p>Proof that they still have my funds: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/vHhI2jj\">https://imgur.com/a/vHhI2jj</a></p>\n\n<p>Timeline from their Medium account:  <a href=\"https://medium.com/coss-official\">COSS Updates &amp; Announcements – Medium</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Let this be a lesson to everyone, don&#39;t keep your crypto on an exchange! The coins I lost weren&#39;t that valuable at the time of the exit scam but I&#39;m surely regretting it now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
