Even the ones that survived like MicroStrategy went through a 90% correction in asset price and had multiple decades before even beginning to recover in price. MSTR is still below its 2000 highs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq took 14 years, from 2000 to 2014 to recover to the same levels as the 2000 tops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SuperBowl advertisements dont mean jack shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“History Doesn&amp;#39;t Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes” – Mark Twain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
