Although it is pretty cool that they did reach their goal of planting 1 million trees, at least there&amp;#39;s that. It has a long road to recover its losses to get back to its ATH. Remember when predictions were at $10 by the end of 2021, lol. Funny. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your most disappointing holding?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I have been buying all the way up, so my avg price is $.80. My third largest holding at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
