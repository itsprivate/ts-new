Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called &amp;quot;next gen eth competitors.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that. All claim insane TPS and finality times, but when the shit gets real, the fees and network congestion go up to the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
