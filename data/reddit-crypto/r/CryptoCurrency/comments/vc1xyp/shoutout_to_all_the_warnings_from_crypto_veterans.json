Taking out leverage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t because this sub would have posts from vets saying - dont do that. Warning that crypto winters are coooold and hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I DCAed in. I avoided alt coins. I didnt spend more than I can afford to lose. I diversified into energy stocks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now its the end of the world - and I feel fine! No leverage so my crypto can sit there. I have cash so I dont need to panic sell. Im actually getting ready to buy when we truly hit the bottom! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So thanks to all the gloomy bastards who spent the last two years warning to be careful - I was ready for this shit show because of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
