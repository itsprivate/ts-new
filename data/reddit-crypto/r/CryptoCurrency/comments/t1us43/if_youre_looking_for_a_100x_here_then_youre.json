But don’t expect 4 digit % gains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that investing in still unpopular startups could be very risky. You risk rug pulls or scams since this market is completely unregulated.\nAnd while there are exceptions with projects with insurance backing like Solanaprime and others that can mitigate such risks, for the most part it will be risky otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The important thing is to not get impulsive and let FOMO take control over you. Always make educated guesses and well thought out investments. This is the only reliable way to make profit long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
