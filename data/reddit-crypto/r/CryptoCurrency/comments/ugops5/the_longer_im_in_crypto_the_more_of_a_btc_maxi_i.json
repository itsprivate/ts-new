There&amp;#39;s some that I am very excited about and could see or are doing great things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s one big problem with each of these altcoins: you can&amp;#39;t fully trust them anymore. Stuff like the recent crypto dot com ordeal, SOL, and the constant rugpulls. It&amp;#39;s becoming more clear that you can&amp;#39;t trust a project. There is always the thought in the back of my mind now that the developers could one day pull a CDC and just fuck over their investors. Neglect the attention ot to cover all their bases. Or just say fuck it and dip out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only project I seem to fully trust is Bitcoin now. I&amp;#39;m not worried about the developers deciding, &amp;quot;oh, we&amp;#39;re actually going to make the max supply 100m now instead of 21m.&amp;quot; Everything is set. It&amp;#39;s all Gucci. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will I only invest in BTC now? Heck nah. I&amp;#39;ll still keep my eyes peeled and sink some beer money into alts. But now I will be extra, extra careful. Chasing gains is over. I&amp;#39;m only interested in things I can trust for now on. CDC taught me a lesson. So thanks for that, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
