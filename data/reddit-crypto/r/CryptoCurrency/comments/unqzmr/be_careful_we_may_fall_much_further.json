People are all of a sudden realising these so called guaranteed stable coin returns were actually unrealistic and made of unicorn dust. Alot of people are taking a step back and thinking, are the returns on my staking realistic? Could I be like the Luna holders and not be able to take funds out in the event of a crash? Where are the returns coming from?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All valid risks, people are much cautious. The authorities will regulate this space as a result. They have their catalyst. They could force other stables like tether to reveal their assets and they too could be made of unicorn dust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My message is this. The risks are still very grave here and if your not prepared to whether the storm think seriously about investing and never invest more than you can afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am still bullish long term. I will be patiently DCAing awaiting the next run. We will all be ok, just be sure you understand now is an extremely risky time to be investing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
