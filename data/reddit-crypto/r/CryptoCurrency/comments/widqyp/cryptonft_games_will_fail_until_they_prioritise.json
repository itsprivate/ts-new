  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their current form, crypto games are terrible. At best, most games look like second-rate games from the early 2000s. Shitty graphics, janky controls and animations, devoid of any gameplay of merit and best of all; they have predatory crypto/NFT transactions forcibly reamed into every orifice making them completely unavoidable to playing the game without spending a fortune. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do people play games? I thought it was to have fun? No self respecting gamer wants to play this dogshit. Every one is a cynical attempt at a game rushed out to market by lazy devs and artists devoid of creativity and morals, looking to cash in on the metaverse circlejerk that has, thankfully, died down a bit from last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do these devs actually think these are good games, or are they shamelessly just pumping them out like the 1000s of shitcoins out there? (I suspect its the latter).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For any crypto game to come even close to succeeding with mainstream audiences, it needs the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- MAKE IT FUN TO PLAY. This seems obvious, but the game should be fun. If it&amp;#39;s not, it won&amp;#39;t succeed further than the bloodsucking yokels that only play these games in the slim hope naïve suckers will join so they can sell their tokens, land or scholarships to, or whatever other predatory items/practices the shitty game has forced into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- CRYPTO/NFT FUNCTIONALITY SHOULD BE A SECONDARY FOCUS. This ties in with making it &amp;#39;fun&amp;#39; to play. These cash-grabs are plainly obvious to mainstream gamers; it&amp;#39;s is why there&amp;#39;s such a massive backlash against crypto being forced into games. Most people that actually play games know what makes a game fun to play and will spot a cynical cash-grab a mile off (surprisingly, finance &amp;amp; crypto nuts looking for the next hot speculative asset have nfi and are more likely to fall for these dumb games)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- IMPLEMENT CRYPTO AS SOMETHING THAT&amp;#39;S NOT REQUIRED TO ENJOY THE GAME, BUT THERE&amp;#39;S A COMPELLING REASON FOR IT TO BE THERE. This ties into the first two points. It&amp;#39;s obvious, but no-one is doing it yet. I wonder why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE TOKENOMICS. DON&amp;#39;T TIE IT IN WITH A SHITCOIN THAT&amp;#39;S GOING TO &amp;#39;MOON&amp;#39;. If you want long-term players, carefully implement tokenomics that are designed with a long-term stable economy in mind. You also want the barrier to entry to be low so that anyone can play. Otherwise, it&amp;#39;ll be an Axie Infinity where predatory scholarship type-arrangements are set up by whales to &amp;#39;help&amp;#39; players get into the game (because the average person does not have enough money for the start-up costs). Or it&amp;#39;ll moon and turn quickly into a pump &amp;amp; dump that&amp;#39;ll die out in a month (a ponzi scheme).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto games suck and won&amp;#39;t become more popular unless they stop being made by arrogant, greedy wankers trying to cash in on the &amp;#39;metaverse&amp;#39; hype. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what the fuck even is the &amp;#39;metaverse&amp;#39;? It&amp;#39;s fucking nothing. It&amp;#39;s just an awkward noise expressed from the arse of people who think they know better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
