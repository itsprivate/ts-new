I was asked by many in the thread to post a monthly update. I only have the time about every couple of months, so, here are the results after twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, all of the kids have since had birthdays, but I have left their ages at time of investment below for reference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of them were up more than 100% in my previous update six months ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M** (9yrs old, boy): ETH, THETA, ADA.

I bought them each $100 worth of cryptos of their choice and will give them the entire investment when they turn 18. I let them make their choices based on whatever reasons they wanted. All I did was show them the top 100 list from coinmarketcap.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are their allocations and reasons for each decision:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M** (9yrs old, boy): ETH, THETA, ADA.&lt;/strong&gt; He really loved the black diamond and thought the other two had nice aesthetic designs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A** (7 yrs old, girl): ETH, AAVE, CRV.&lt;/strong&gt; She also loved the black diamond, the AAVE has her favourite colour and starts with the same letter as her first name, CRV has a pretty rainbow.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E** (4 yrs old, girl): UNI, ENJ, CAKE.&lt;/strong&gt; She loves unicorns and therefore, loves UNI. The ENJ logo has a very pretty E for her name. CAKE because she loves pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
