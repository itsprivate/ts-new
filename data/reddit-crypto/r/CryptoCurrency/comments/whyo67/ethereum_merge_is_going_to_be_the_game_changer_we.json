At this point if you are not convinced of what an enormous event this will be for crypto and all of us who believe in the Ethereum project all I can say is be ready to watch this thing take off. It won&amp;#39;t be over night although the media will praise this one of the biggest technological and environmental upgrades seen to date. The fact these guys plan to merge at any given time without stopping the chain is truly amazing. The price may not be indicative of what will happen right away but as Ethereum after merge continues its road map and executes it to perfection you will see more and more people and institutions get on board. There is simply too much money to be made and too many goodies to play with like DEFI, NFT&amp;#39;s or ENS domains plus now we are almost all of us on a layer 2. They keep coming and its not stopping. Once all exchanges participate and on board clients to L2&amp;#39;s the game will have changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion Ethereum is going to lead the pack of crypto moving forward. I won&amp;#39;t talk about flippening or stuff like that because simply who cares. The tech and decentralization speaks for itself. The world&amp;#39;s computer is here to stay and not going anywhere. What I am most excited about is that Ethereum is going to take center stage soon and will be finally acknowledged as a wonderful decentralized technology that welcomes all humans and all institutions to join, build and play. Its teh way it should be. All inclusive with no means to discriminate or shun those who don&amp;#39;t like it or agree with it. You know who you are!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peace. Merge incoming soon. Be ready!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
