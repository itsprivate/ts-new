Stock market and Crypto saw massive sharp unexpected dips. All that happened for Crypto during a bear market period after the 2018 parabolic top. That was the time where BTC and Crypto were called &amp;quot;officially death&amp;quot; even by its own investors as this was very unexpected and many did not have any hope for a return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we are two years in the future. BTC recovered from a -80% down from its ATH and even after then made another +200%. All that from - 80% to +200% happened in about one year. And today just a year later those FOMO levels are the new Fear levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That up and downs are completely normal for Crypto. The ones who don&amp;#39;t give up and stick to their strategy are those that will be rewarded. Even in the darkest of times we should know that everything is just transitory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
