Have you guys tried sorting by new? Oh my goodness the “technical analysis” I’ve seen is incredible. That leads me to ask,\nis your coin of choice going up? Have you seen the triple double golden shower triangle? Well, the funny numbers only go up so you best spread the word! Be sure to tell everyone that your coin is pumping, will keep pumping, and will never stop pumping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you take the price chart and take it to art class? If you have doodled and discovered some fun shapes in the chart than you bet your ass it’s &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; analyzed! Just take a crayon, and take a chart, you can try this at home! They’re never wrong!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what I’m asking of you friends, shill me your best technical analysis! Do you know shit about fuck? Are you going to shitpost in the comments, or do you know what you’re talking about?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IS THIS FINANCIAL ADVICE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not financial advice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;or is it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: spelling&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
