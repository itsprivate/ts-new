All of them received a part of the private key needed to create Zcash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allegedly, Snowden didn&amp;#39;t get any compensation, and his involvement was just for the public interest. In his interview with Zcash Media Snowden said: “The reason that I did that was I saw it being worked on by a number of trusted academic cryptographers. And I thought it was a very interesting project because when we look at cryptocurrencies in general, we generally see the cryptographic properties is being used to make sure it’s a fair ledger, but not that it’s been used to ensure that it’s a private ledger. The problem with that is you can’t have free trade unless you have private trade and you can’t have a free society without a free trade.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is your opinion on Snowden&amp;#39;s role in Zcash?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jzo76jmrgaw81.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5adfc3aa5426d09c2a7a2933fa033ff1eb16a1ed\"&gt;Image: coindesk.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
