That&amp;#39;s a good margin below the estimates of 8.7% and massively below last month&amp;#39;s CPI of 9.1%. Markets will now probably start to rally. And that lower inflation was crucial for Crypto to continue its rally and expand it further on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also in my yesterday&amp;#39;s post about inflation numbers I layed out the scenario of a lower than 8.7% inflation and that will mostly happen now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has especially been important as the FED will have no arguement at all now to do a 100bps hike and weay be looking at a 50bps hike next month that could make markets pump even more as the FED is looking to pivot now. Who knows whether inflation has peaked now bit the US government will definitely make it market like that as we are going into Midterm elections. Crypto will have less moving forward from the FED and a reversal, at least for now, is actually possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
