I got a tiny amount of BTC and didn&#39;t think much of it. Coming back to it though I saw something interesting to me and propably obvious to you. From 1.5 usd it went to 1.73 usd. Pretty meaninless right? Kept watching it and now it&#39;s at 2,03. Something just clicked while I was eating the take out I just ordered. If I had bought 10 dollars of BTC and not bought take out,I would have an appreciating asset. That btc is only going to get more valuable. I currently own something like 0.00004 BTC. But I&#39;ve now realized that I&#39;m wasteful, and if had I put that extra money into assets (in this case crypto) for a year rather than using it for take out or skins on some game,I would have hundreds maybe even a thousands worth of an asset that keeps appreciating and is CONSTANTLY getting rarer and more valuable. Think about how you spend your money. I&#39;ve only just realized what it means to have an asset that appreciates in value, and best believe I&#39;m gonna divert my extra cash in there and thank my self in a few years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
