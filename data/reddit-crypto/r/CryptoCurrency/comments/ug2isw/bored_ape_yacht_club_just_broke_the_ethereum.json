The Ethereum blockchain was crushed by the demand.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Bored Ape Yacht Club crashed Ethereum on Saturday night. As part of the upcoming Bored Ape metaverse called Otherside, developers Yuga Labs on Saturday launched a new NFT collection which consists of 100,000 land deeds for the virtual world. Interest in the drop was immense -- too much for the Ethereum blockchain to handle. &lt;strong&gt;Users ended up paying thousands of dollars in fees for failed transactions, and Ethereum proved unusable for hours due to its inability to distribute the load.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How are users ok spending thousands in fees for failed transactions and why are people so hell bent on saying Ethereum is the place to be when launching such products, as the gas prices can at times outweigh the amount you spend on a transaction?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t understand why there cant be a refund mechanism for failed transactions, especially in circumstances when the blockchain is overloaded by users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
