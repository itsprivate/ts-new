I found a site that let’s you swap moons off of rinkeby for Nano. Like proper, actual coins. 10 of them actually, so a whopping $50! :D </p>\n\n<p>I got the coins over to my exchange and carefully pulled out. I then immediately released that this is nowhere near enough money to fulfill any of my big dreams. Except maybe one. One small one. So I went for it. </p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, my first Aneros prostate massager arrived in the mail. It was an experience I’ll tell you that. So this is the story of how I got fucked by moons. Be careful out there, it could happen to you too!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
