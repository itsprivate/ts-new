Not sure how they bypassed my Google Authenticator, though…</p>\n\n<p>Edit3:After further discussions, it’s also likely that I got phished. I was also a victim in the Ledger leak - (thankfully majority of my holdings are offline) and I’ve been a target for numerous phishing emails. I thought I had been diligent. But, ya never know.</p>\n\n<p>Edit2:\nI spoke with Coinbase - they credited the $2000 that was stolen from my bank account almost instantly. Of corse, my bank basically told me to get lost and good luck. I genuinely give Coinbase credit for how prompt they’ve been.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
