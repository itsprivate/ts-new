While the minutes indicated that there is no increased rates from what&amp;#39;s already planned, JPow had some hawkish undertones in his answers. Nothing sounded too dovish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he is even now saying there could be increases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are back to neutral...maybe even bearish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there is a lot of fog in JPow&amp;#39;s answers. And he said a lot of the decisions will come in the next meeting in March with more details on numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stock crash potentially back on the table. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;____________________&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;As you might have already guessed with stocks shooting up, and cryptos spking, we didn&amp;#39;t get the doom and gloom news today, we got some moderately bullish news.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Keep in mind, inflation is still very high, so it&amp;#39;s not all rosy either.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;So long term, there are still major economic issues looming.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;It&amp;#39;s also not super bullish for liquidity, or artificially propping up stocks with lowered rates.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a fine balance, and probably a best case scenario.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;In the minutes they mention unemployment has dropped, and the economic outlook is improving, according to the Fed.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;So maybe no stock market crash...for this week.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Meaning maybe no Bitcoin crash below $30K this week either.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;In fact, the spike in Bitcoin could potentially create a short squeeze, and we could see prices above $40K this week.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;But we are not quiet out of the woods yet:&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;We still have the press meeting....so don&amp;#39;t pull out the party hats yet.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;We still need to hear how dovish or hawkish JPow might sound, and we haven&amp;#39;t heard about timelines.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
