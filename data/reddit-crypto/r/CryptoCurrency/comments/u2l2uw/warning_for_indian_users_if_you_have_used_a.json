The law protects people against unauthorised searches and seizures, without any warrant. Users of CEX are not performing any illegal activity, and there is no probable cause to effect seizure of everyone&amp;#39;s data. Yet the CEX have happily turned over people&amp;#39;s data to the government, who is now coming after crypto traders. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is possible that one or two users may engage in illegal activity, but that does not allow the government to seize everyone&amp;#39;s data under suspicion. These are draconian violations of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
