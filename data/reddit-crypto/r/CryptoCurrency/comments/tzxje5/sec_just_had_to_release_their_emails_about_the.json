The emails are showing how much of a improper behavior they had towards certain Cryptos and advantages for other Crypto, namely Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;William Hinman a former SEC official met several Law firms in NYC and ETH Co-founders. That comes before he in 2018 announced that ETH is not a security, but Ripple is. Obviously that does not mean that Etherum is going to have any problems as they did trigger those meetings, at least we don&amp;#39;t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if Ripple is a centralized crypto I&amp;#39;m 100% rooting for them here. A win for ripple would a for Crypto and it does look as if they could indeed win.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
