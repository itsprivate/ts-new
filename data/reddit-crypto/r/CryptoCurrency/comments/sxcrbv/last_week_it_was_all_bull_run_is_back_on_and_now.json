People started to get the BTC to 100 or 200k posts ready to go and any potential war between russia and Ukraine were dismissed as FUD. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a whole 7 days later and there are multiple posts about being in a crypto winter for the foreseeable future. This is the volatility that comes with the territory of being in the space so instead of riding the roller coaster it might benefit some to just unplug from the daily/weekly news and chart watching. If you set your limit orders and price alerts then go live your life, it’s much harder to be affected by the constant volatility. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows what’s in store for next week? Personally I think it’s bearish news for the foreseeable future with, coming interest rate hikes, tax season, and the constant threat of global conflict despite institutional involvement being at an all time high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
