Their response was that the mistake was my own as I had visited a scam site and not BSCPad.com. I&#39;m certain the site I visited and allowed the contract interaction on was bscpad.com. Shortly after my interaction their website was redirecting to velaspad. They&#39;ve deflected answering why their site was doing this.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m happy to be corrected and apologise profusely to the team behind BSCPad if I&#39;m wrongfully accusing them.</p>\n\n<p>edit: so I&#39;m not clogging up the post with my thanks individually can I just say to each and everyone of you wishing me the recovery of my money thanks heaps. You guys are awesome.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
