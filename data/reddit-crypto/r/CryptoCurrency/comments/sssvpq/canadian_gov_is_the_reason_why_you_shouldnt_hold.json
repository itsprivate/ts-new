  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So recently the gov of Canada enforced emergency powers and is telling banks to freeze assets of people involved in the convoy. The banks of course will comply and can freeze assets without any court order. Im not sure if its the people donating as well or if its donations over a certain sum but the point stands. The gov has the power to take your money as they see fit without any warning, and it wont be just the evil Russian/China governments doing so but the friendly Canadian one as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are also trying to prevent crypto transactions. They can tell exchanges operating in Canada to freeze peoples accounts and of course the exchanges will have to comply just like the banks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why you never keep your money on the exchange, because tomorrow the gov could decide to freeze your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also a good reason to buy privacy coins like monero, although its going through a hiccup right now. But thats a different topic&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not your keys not your coin&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also Im not for/against the protestors. Thats a political debate, Im pointing out the fact that the gov can just freeze peoples assets as they deem necessary. Maybe WW3 breaks out with Russia and the gov needs money to fund the military so they say 10% from everyone&amp;#39;s account will be taken or whatever. Keep your coins safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
