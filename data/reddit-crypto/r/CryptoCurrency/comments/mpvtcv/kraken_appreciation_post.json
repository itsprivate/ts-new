I provided screenshots for proof of both of my accounts and the transfer date, time and amount, and they said because it was from a public address (or something along those lines) there was a 30 day waiting period before they can investigate. \nThis all happened mid February but sure enough after a few followup emails from them they just deposited the XLM into my Kraken account and I&#39;m so happy I didn&#39;t end up paying for my stupid stupid mistake! Always triple check when transferring crypto! \nHope you all are doing great and making gains!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
