After hearing the story of how his incompetence caused this project to fail it’s also easy to dunk on the investors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe take a moment to reach out, if that’s not brigading, lend some support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, we all invested in cryptocurrency to hopefully have a better life, break free from the corrupted FED, the manipulative stock market, to be our own bank…just to for a hope of having an edge in this life where literally EVERYTHING is harder, more expensive, and stressful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is always a way out, if you feel hopeless, talk to someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: no upvotes please, I just noticed on the main page there are better posts explaining my sentiments.
