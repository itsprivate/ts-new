So i did this, and now my opinion,  you may not like it. I didn&#39;t really like getting paid in BTC, and i told Them to stop the BTC payments and Just to give me euro&#39;s. Its not very profitable at all. First of all they use a really bad conversion rate, so you are getting not a lot of BTC. Its better to buy it with the money you have yourself. Second thing, the fees are bad and i had to Pay those fees. So i was getting even less BTC. So imo getting paid in crypto isnt worth it at all,  BTC is ofcourse one of the worst to get paid in since theres coins with way lower fees. Also one thing, with the value of your salary that&#39;s going up and down like crazy its definitely not possible to get paid 100% in crypto since if it crashes you cannot cover your expenses. I liked to try this out, it was a fun experience but not a good one 😅.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
