People brush it off as FUD, some even asked for Russia to &amp;quot;just fucking do it&amp;quot; so we can get over with it already. Seriously what the FUCK is wrong with people like you? Wishing for a country to be invaded by one of the most powerful forces in the world just so your favorite shitcoin can start to go up in value again? Be glad you are not on the edge of a war. People in this space have no ethics and are just as bad as your average banker investing in the war industry. I thought embracing authoritarian quasi-dictators like Bukele and Erdogan is bad enough but this crap takes it to a whole new level. Fuck everybody who thinks that way. Rethink your values.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
