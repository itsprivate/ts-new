I did lumpsum investments, weekly recurring investments, monthly recurring, staking, Coinbase earn, conversions, literally everything you can do on Coinbase (besides sell) and have never ever had one issue. I mean, I’m not out here throwing money at memecoins but I’d say I’m using Coinbase the way it is supposed to be used and what they promise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve more than tripled what I put in, and do not have a single complaint about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone else that is completely satisfied with Coinbase? I can’t help but think, looking at all these posts, that a lot of the problems people are running into are user error, but maybe I’m the exception?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
