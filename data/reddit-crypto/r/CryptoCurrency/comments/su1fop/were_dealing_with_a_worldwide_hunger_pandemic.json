Start talking more about it, and inform as many as possible that our choices on who to champion have to change, and it&amp;#39;s better to do whatever you can to make life better as a whole for everyone else.   I&amp;#39;m not talking miracles here.   Just help when you can.  See your neighbors trash can tipped over, pick it up.  See a car broke down on the side of the road. Stop.  At least 100 cars drive by someone broken down before someone stops.    Most of those people driving by will say &amp;quot;ah.. they&amp;#39;ll be fine. Someone will stop for them&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just the point.  There&amp;#39;s not enough people stopping to help out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
