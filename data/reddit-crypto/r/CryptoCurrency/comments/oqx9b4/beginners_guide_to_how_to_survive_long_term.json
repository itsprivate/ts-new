  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve been DCA’ing and holding for 8 years and in that time I graduated college, got a job, got married and had too many children. All the while not deviating much from my crypto schedule and plan. Because I have such a simple, lifestyle-friendly technique. It’s not really a guide, just what works for me because I take long breaks from news, markets and especially forums. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I DCA every Sunday, sit down after dinner and think about how I’m going to allocate the weekly crypto fund. Right now I’m heavy on algo but lots still goes to the big two and a few others. Even if it’s just a couple bucks, nobody leaves Sunday without a top up. </li>\n<li>In bulls when my investment doubles I start shaving 10% off the top and sticking it into stable coin* (tether but I might change that eventually) </li>\n<li>I use what I’ve moved into tether to reinvest during dips, sometimes I get caught in the hype on crypto forums and I like to have a reserve in that case because deviating from my DCA schedule and budget isn’t an option with a family here. </li>\n<li>twice a year when I have free time I move it all into cold storage, because I go through long periods of time where I’m not keeping up on the newest scams, hacks and ways thieves are stealing crypto and I don’t want it sitting online unattended while I’m having a baby or something, totally oblivious to some coinbase pro hack. (Ask anyone who lived through Mt. Gox if this is a paranoid fear) </li>\n<li>now exchange is clean and I restart my “investment doubles” mark. I don’t judge based on whole lifetime investments just the amounts I’ve DCA’d weekly since last clean out. I use coin stats to track inputs. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That’s all, same song and dance for 8 years, all that changed over the years is my DCA budget, how much attention I’m paying to the market and weekly allocations. (Although I’ve switched exchanges a few times as things develop) </p>\n\n<p>My husband pays absolutely no attention to crypto and that hasn’t made a difference, it’s just money I use for investments. Though when it comes up in the news or randomly he’ll ask about our position. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re new it’s worth considering a long term plan because you do still need to maintain a life. But all of us will have a personal technique we’ve developed through trial and error.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: to add * to tether. Don’t follow me for coin advice or market predictions lol I’ve made a fuck ton of mistakes, very stupid ones if you read my last post. All I know how to do is keep crypto a sustainable part of your life.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
