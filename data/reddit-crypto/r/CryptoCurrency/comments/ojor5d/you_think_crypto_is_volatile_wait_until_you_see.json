As it is that is already our biggest expense, almost 150% of our mortgage currently. </p>\n\n<p>While some people may say &quot;well you can always go to another, cheaper one&quot;, unfortunately as many parents who both work know it can take a long time to even get into a daycare now, months or even years long. Have even heard of parents signing their children up for daycare as soon as they have a positive pregnancy test in hand and the optimal Trifecta of good, cheap, and close to home daycares usually don&#39;t exist. At best it can be a Pick 2 depending on the area, and since we are both in the medical field, our at-times irregular hours mean we need a bit more flexibility on the drop off and pick up times occasionally, the option of which does not come cheap.</p>\n\n<p>Even basic goods like lumber, equipment parts, and even food are going up much more noticeably and more quickly than previous years. Read somewhere that YOY real inflation estimate is now 5.4%, almost twice as much change as was expected. To me that means from a purely capitalistic POV if you didn&#39;t get more than a 5.4% raise this year then you are losing money YOY and may have to either look for another job or alternate means of income.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings me to crypto. Not saying this is a valid means of alternate income for everybody, but even now there is a fairly low entry point for everyone to get into it somehow. While there is always a chance that it can go down, at the rate &#39;real money&#39; is losing value at more than 5% a year, I think a lot more people who may not have thought to get into crypto may be looking to give it a shot. At the very least, experiment a bit and use some DCA to try and hodl for a little while, seeing which holds value better over a certain amount of time, cash or crypto. What has anyone got to lose? And if your crypto does go down, then at least you can be much more comfortable with rising prices and falling wages which will be coming for your money more quickly 😉 </p>\n\n<p>Edit: holy crap this blew up faster than expected, guess a lot of ppl are pissed about rising prices and falling wages irl. Guess answer is always just buy more good crypto</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
