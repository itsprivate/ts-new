But you really won&amp;#39;t make much money at all. It&amp;#39;s actually an amount you can just ignore. Personally I staked and committed ALGO to governance (the possibly simplest staking coin), still I did not got any amount that may be worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously it&amp;#39;s always nice to get some bonus and as it&amp;#39;s free money you should definitely take it.
