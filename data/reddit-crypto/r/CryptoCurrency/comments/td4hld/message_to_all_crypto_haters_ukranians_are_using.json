  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Bitcoin is dead. Crypto is a ponzi scheme. You are investing in something that doesn&amp;#39;t exist. You can&amp;#39;t get rich from doing nothing. Crypto is just a stupid way to lose money.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9tu2muc5p4n81.png?width=628&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e5cc3cfeba4d2ed2cbbdd37679f98441738e33d2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9tu2muc5p4n81.png?width=628&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e5cc3cfeba4d2ed2cbbdd37679f98441738e33d2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t this a big &amp;quot;f*ck you&amp;quot; in the face to everyone who are against crypto?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine one country being at war. The situation is pretty bad, I don&amp;#39;t have to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that country seeking for help in crypto? That country is, we all know, Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we can ask everyone - Why is cryptocurrency, extremely volatile asset, detached from the financial system, highly speculative asset used as a safe haven for people in need? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it allows anyone and everyone to be able to convert their personal wealth into highly portable, most of the time decentralized,  forms of money. And people who are leaving their homes, who want access to their funds, who want to be able to keep them safe will use crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t this a strong use case? This is what we talked about for years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People from Ukraine are using crypto to survive, escape, buy something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian central bank limited ATM withdrawals, placed restrictions on the country’s official electronic-currency system and suspended the foreign-exchange market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Russian citizens, considering their national currency downtrend are also seeking help in cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are really on the global stage right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What crypto community did for Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-  &lt;a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/6bce8615076a4173a4738817c597b09e\"&gt;Binance to Donate $10M to Ukraine Humanitarian Effort and Launch Crypto-First Crowdfunding Site to Further Help Provide Aid to Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/kraken-to-give-away-over-10-million-worth-of-crypto-to-ukrainian-citizens/\"&gt;Kraken Announces $10 Million Aid Package for Ukraine, Promises $1,000 in Bitcoin Each for Its Ukrainian Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/24/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-well-over-1-on-ukrainian-crypto-exchange/\"&gt;Ukranians used stablecoins USDT (don&amp;#39;t hate) so much that it went above $1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/11/ukraine-details-what-crypto-donations-are-being-spent-on/?fbclid=IwAR0nN5H4PHAhqpVLSD93BdeEpej0Y8-1ed3sDZQSsdBGfO_uRDuj_vk9N5w\"&gt;Top post in r/cc - Ukraine used $10 million of crypto donations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, what else we need to say, what article we need to read, what else we should do to prove everyone how crypto is strong and how can help for those in need. Good job crypto community, I love being part of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
