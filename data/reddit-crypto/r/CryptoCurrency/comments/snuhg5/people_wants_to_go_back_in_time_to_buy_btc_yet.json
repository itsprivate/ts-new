The opportunity of a lifetime has been in front of people for a months if not years now! Many people dismiss crypto because they don’t understand it. Instead of giving an hour of their time to begin learning about the problems that crypto solves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop listening to good ol’ banks. They don’t care about you.
