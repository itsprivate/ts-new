I mean what I’m about to say as genuine advice, not to make fun of anyone, but a lot of people here really need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day we have people stressing and speculating over the day-to-day movements of their crypto, panicking over bear markets, asking “where should I invest this spare $50?!” in the daily. When in reality, they could see their portfolio do a 2x by working a few solid minimum wage shifts and dumping the paycheck into crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A nice 20% pump on the $100 you invested in your favourite alt-coin which you spent hours researching, still only leaves you with $20 profit. You could probably ask your mom for $20 and she’d give it to you. It might be a harsh truth, but crypto isn’t a life-changing opportunity until you’re working with a decent stack of money, until then, conventional money-making methods are faster and more lucrative (without the potential downside of investing!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s not what you want to hear, but a couple hundred dollars in the market isn’t going to make you financially free unless you’re the crypto-embracing, second coming of Warren Buffett. Grinding out a real life job and dumping that money into crypto? That might just do the trick though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important disclaimer/reminder:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean ZERO hate to small time investors whatsoever with this post. You guys are learning essential lessons and gaining investing experience without the risk and potential downside of others with more skin in the game, and most importantly, small amounts of money can mean a hell of a lot more to some people than others. I’m simply saying look at the bigger picture, and make the most of your time. Crypto becomes more rewarding the more you can safely invest into it, typical jobs might not have the potential of crypto, but they will build you a base and give you a start way faster and safer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
