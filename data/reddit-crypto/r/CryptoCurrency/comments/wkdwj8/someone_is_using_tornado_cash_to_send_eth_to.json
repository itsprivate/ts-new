Earlier today, someone or a group of individuals began using tornado cash to send ETH to known wallets of celebrities.

Wealthy groups could even use TC to take down competitors.  For example, if I don&amp;#39;t like a DAO, I can simply send it a few ETH from TC and then watch them struggle to off-ramp their treasury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This type of attack was pretty obvious to crypto users from the beginning, but you can be sure congress never expected this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
