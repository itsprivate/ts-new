I’ve spent the last few months watching videos, joining social media servers, reading articles and exploring platforms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel more lost than ever. I just get to the point where I think I’ve figured out a way to earn a reasonable yield only to find out that it’s outdated and there are half a dozen new and improved ways to do what I’m looking for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been on a wilder goose chase. I can’t tell if I’m a technological idiot or if it really is this time consuming and difficult?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I’m not talking about staking PoS coins like ADA, DOT, etc. What I meant was coins/tokens that require additional steps such as BTC, LINK, etc. And yes, I could stake those on Celsius or BlockFi but I was referring more to LPs. But you are all correct, I am probably taking more time than the average person to figure this out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would appear I am a slight to moderate technological idiot&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
