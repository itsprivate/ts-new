  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A  year ago today, May 10, 2021, a new coin seemed to suddenly appear out of nowhere for most of us: a coin with the pretty weird name Internet Computer (ICP). It had the most explosive start of any coin I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. It entered the top 10 immediately, &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210511041514/https://coinmarketcap.com/\"&gt;even went to #4&lt;/a&gt; for a few hours, with only BTC, ETH and BNB ahead of it. On the first day it was even listed on sites like Coingecko and Coinmarketcap! I remember thinking this was a bug when there suddenly was a new coin in the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, it is sitting solidly below $15, even went below $10 yesterday - what happened? Well, $700 was just absurdly overpriced, it seems. But to be fair, ICP has had incredibly bad luck with its timing, as it was released just days before Bitcoin&amp;#39;s biggest crash in recent history, which dragged the whole market down with it. On May 10, BTC opened at &lt;strong&gt;above $58&lt;/strong&gt;, only 3 days later it opened below $50k and kept going down, to a low of  &lt;strong&gt;$30,681.50&lt;/strong&gt; on May 19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ICP was hit too, but much harder - I would guess it would have gone down from $700 even in a good market. There was quite a bit of up and down in the first few days, but it (at least temporarily, respectively) went below $400 on May 11, below $300 on May 12, below $200 on May 17 and below $100 on May 19. &lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#39;s $700 to below $100 in nine days.&lt;/strong&gt; There were a few ups and downs in the following days but it permanently went below $100 on June 8, less than a month after its release, and never returned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know what&amp;#39;s impressive, though? You would expect a coin that has fallen more than 98% to be at like rank 300 or something at best. But nope, it is still sitting somewhere around #40 - &lt;strong&gt;that&amp;#39;s how absurdly high its market cap was!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday ICP, I&amp;#39;m curios where you&amp;#39;ll be in a year!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
