Mostly underground groups, Privacy Nuts, Hackers etc, and according to word spread in some of these groups, Hal Finney used it. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me considering how paranoid he was about privacy.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s still being updated by the community. A Stable release was just last month. </p>\n\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora\">https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora</a></p>\n\n<p>Taken from wiki, </p>\n\n<p>The project was conceived after Ilya gathered the team to attended a lecture by Columbia Law School  professor and Free software activist Eben Moglen in February 2010 about the threat to privacy posed by commercial Internet services. </p>\n\n<p>According to Moglen, Zhitomirskiy was &quot;immensely talented&quot; and &quot;the most idealistic of the group... He had a choice between graduate school and this project, and he chose to do the project because he wanted to do something with his time that would make freedom&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong>:  <em>Diaspora didn&#39;t grow as big as Ethereum because it never offered incentives to motivate people to participate in growing it on such a large scale</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this is true.  People want incentives to do that type of work.  But Diaspora has grown slowly but surely, and we can all support it by using it over Facebook. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t know if this happened to anyone else recently.  Facebook just automatically restricted me from using reactions to prevent misuse. </p>\n\n<p><em>We&#39;ve temporarily restricted your ability to use this feature</em> </p>\n\n<p>This was after I reacted to too many posts within a certain time frame. </p>\n\n<p>I barely ever use my Facebook.  Two days ago I logged on, seen some birthdays popup, and went on a short positive reaction spree with posts on my feed.  Kinda like letting people know I&#39;m still there.   Whatever.  After a few of them that notification popped up and I couldn&#39;t use reactions anymore.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s only gonna get worse. </p>\n\n<p>Just an all around centralized shithole like being in a country run by an evil dictator...don&#39;t do this, don&#39;t do that, don&#39;t say this, don&#39;t share that.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you Ilya for your efforts. </p>\n\n<p>I will continue to use Diaspora in defiance of what these centralized networks have become.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
