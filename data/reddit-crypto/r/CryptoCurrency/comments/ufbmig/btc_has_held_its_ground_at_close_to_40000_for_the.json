AND while all of this is happening, btc has held its ground at close to 40k as possible for the last couple of months. All time highs is at +60k, and we&amp;#39;re staying steady at almost 40k here. If you don&amp;#39;t recognize how insane this is, then you must be new and must have joined during this crazy bull market where everything just went up and up. and you weren&amp;#39;t here before, you weren&amp;#39;t here during the crypto boom in 2017, the crash in 2018 and even before. If you were here from that time, then you understand how lucky we are that btc is still holding its ground and staying this high while everything is going to shit. The fact that it&amp;#39;s not worse means we are extremely lucky and we should appreciate this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
