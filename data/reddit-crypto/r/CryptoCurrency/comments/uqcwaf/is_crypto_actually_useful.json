Currently valued at 18 billion, but why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can my mom benefit from Solana for example? How can a company benefit from Solana? And how is it different from Avalance, Aave, Matic &amp;amp; the hundreds of other projects?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, try to reply to me as if you were talking to a no-coiner, use real world example preferably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit :&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m aware of the very obvious money transfer aspect, which is actually great yes, but there are thousands of cryptos offering exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know there are many phone, banks and clothing companies too, but designer clothing doesn&amp;#39;t serve the same consumers as kids clothing, just like with premium phones/cheap android phones or islamic banks/off-shore banks. Variety is necessary, but when it comes to money transfer, you just want it done as cheap and fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does justify the existence of thousands of projects serving the same purpose (p2p transfers) more than 10 years after the invention of Bitcoin, some with billions in market cap?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
