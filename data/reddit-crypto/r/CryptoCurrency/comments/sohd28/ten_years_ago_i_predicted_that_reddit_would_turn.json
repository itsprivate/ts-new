Biometrics and facial recognition in VR headsets or AR glasses will be used to authenticate users to a specific wallet address, guaranteeing that no user votes twice. This will lead to an informal global democracy. Ignoring or acting against the will of global consensus will be considered political taboo in many countries. Over time, this voting mechanism will fundamentally transform the way in which humanity governs itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading my silly prediction. Obligatory, this is not financial advice but entertainment only. Proof of my last prediction is noted in the subreddit&amp;#39;s wiki under the crypto history section.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
