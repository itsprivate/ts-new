All stable coin rates are dropping by 2%. Flexible earn is dropping from 8% to 4% so if you have 30k then anything else in flex is 2%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;//edit 2: I’ll add the recommendations below this post, my research into them and my finding later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, thanks to &lt;a href=\"/u/ashtonlaszlo\"&gt;/u/ashtonlaszlo&lt;/a&gt; who has put together a Google doc &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/htmlview\"&gt;comparison doc&lt;/a&gt; that shows the rates for ~200 different coins. And, that you can get 12.68% and 12.73% on USDT/USDC at Vauld and Hodlnaut, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
