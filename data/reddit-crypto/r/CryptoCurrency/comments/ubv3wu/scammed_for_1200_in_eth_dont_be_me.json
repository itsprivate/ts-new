  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, last year I started mining for the first time. I ended up getting around $1200 dollars worth of ETH, ETH which I planned to use for my fiancee and my wedding. Etherium that I will now.. never get back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fell for a simple bot scam where I transferred out of my wallet. I&amp;#39;m too embarrassed to actually say how. I.. can&amp;#39;t. (I ended up adding this in the comments) Just, don&amp;#39;t be me. Don&amp;#39;t be an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this as a method to help myself cope. It&amp;#39;s cathartic, but I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do at the moment. This is probably one of the worst feelings I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;d also like to add this isn&amp;#39;t meant to be a pitty post. I can&amp;#39;t actually explain how I feel currently outside of them term &amp;quot;numb&amp;quot;. I think I&amp;#39;m trying to rationalize it more so with writing this out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Thank you to some very kind folks. I&amp;#39;m going to &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; down and get a part-time weekend job to pay this back to myself. Deserve it. But that&amp;#39;s my way of making this a true lesson, with a good result in the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
