This is what undervalued and forgotten projects such as digibyte need. </p>\n\n<p>Love or hate CRO it has also been fantastic for crypto exposure and adoption. Congratulations to all the CRO hodlers out there hope you guys are on your way to millionaires 😊🚀</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: love the positivity in the comments guys, this is what crypto should all be about 💪 a lot of hate around here recently so it’s good to see a friendly comments section :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
