  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>What&#39;s the poll?</h3>\n\n<h4>We can use the Flair system to give Moons bonuses or penalties to encourage the best kind of posts that all visitors to the sub enjoy and benefit from. Moons awarded should be proportional to effort spent.</h4>\n\n<h3>How?</h3>\n\n<h4>A few of us Mods recently changed the flair system to be less specific and get rid of some of the older and irrelevant flairs. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lm99v3/change_moon_distribution_for_comedy_posts_and/\">We currently award 10% (x0.1) of moons to Comedy posts and Media posts.</a> I propose that we choose some sensible <strong><em>&quot;Moons Multipliers&quot;</em></strong> to all of our flairs.</h4>\n\n<h3>What&#39;s the benefit?</h3>\n\n<h4>Some of the best and most helpful posts on this subreddit are when redditors sit down and perform awesome write-ups. I&#39;ve seen tonnes of helpful threads such as a full documentation of the best Liquidity Farming platforms, users that create tools for the community to use, and in-depth, thoughtful debates. I believe we can further incentivize these posts by awarding Multipliers to each flair to curate the content this community provides to what&#39;s beneficial, and not link farming or lazy comedy posts with minor alterations.</h4>\n\n<h3>What&#39;s the drawback?</h3>\n\n<h4>A hell of a lot of posts get submitted daily to this subreddit. 4 figures per day sometimes. And as this has the potential to award users more Moons than normal for their posts, you can bet your ass some gaming of the system will go down. Here&#39;s some thoughts I&#39;ve had for you to digest;</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>While users can game the system, we only need to consider the handful of posts that reach the front page. I couldn&#39;t care less if someone awarded their 16 karma post a 1.25x Multiplier flair.</p></li>\n<li><p>Incorrectly flaired and popular posts are inherently viewable and we already have &quot;incorrect flair&quot; reporting, plus the ability to change flairs.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Users can&#39;t change flair after set, so they can&#39;t game posts after they&#39;ve become popular.  </p></li>\n<li><p>This could cause a reduced diversity of posts, but the types of posts that earn bonus moons do require extra effort.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Proposed Multipliers</h3>\n\n<h4>I&#39;ve posted this a few times in the Meta sub and the current flairs &amp; their proposed multipliers are well accepted. There&#39;s always room for improvement however.</h4>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Flair</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n<th>Moons Multiplier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Analysis</td>\n<td>For analysis self-posts, trading analysis, profit &amp; loss etc</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk2rtw/the_ultimate_guide_to_earning_passive_income_with/\">The ultimate guide to earning passive income with cryptocurrencies</a></td>\n<td>1.25x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Debate</td>\n<td>Comparing &amp; Contrasting different coins or technologies</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lt2wyz/top_25_cryptocurrencies_3_pros_3_cons/\">Top 25 Cryptocurrencies - 3 Pros, 3 Cons</a></td>\n<td>1.25x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Comedy</td>\n<td>Those <em>hilarious</em> gotcha self-posts, like the daughters idiot boyfriend</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqavxo/to_all_the_newbies_this_has_never_happened_before/\">To all the newbies: This has never happened before, Bitcoin was only meant to go straight up</a></td>\n<td>0.1x (no change from current)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anecdote</td>\n<td>Self stories, such as <strong>&quot;I sold all to buy my Dad a &#39;how to love your son for dummies&#39; textbook&quot;</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oa9qvt/i_24f_feel_like_a_bad_btch_compared_to_my/\">I (24F) feel like a bad b*tch compared to my boyfriend</a></td>\n<td>0.1x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Advice</td>\n<td>&quot;Take your coins off exchange&quot; &quot;Use 2 Factor Authentication&quot;</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pia31k/no_leaving_your_crypto_on_an_exchange_is_not_the/\">No, leaving your crypto on an exchange is not the end of the world and you don&#39;t have to move your $100 woth of crypto to a cold wallet</a></td>\n<td>0.5x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tool</td>\n<td>Users that build tools for the community to use, such as CCMoons website, Exchange-Bots, PnL calculators</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://ccmoons.com/\">ccmoons.com</a></td>\n<td>1.5x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Perspective</td>\n<td>A user&#39;s thoughts, which often prompt discussion but with no analysis</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qokcpi/you_can_find_a_x100_coin_you_just_cant_hodl_it/\">You CAN find a x100 coin.
