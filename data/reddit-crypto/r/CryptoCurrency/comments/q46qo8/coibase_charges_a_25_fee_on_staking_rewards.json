Staking on coinbase also comes with certain risks and the lacks guarantees that makes me unwilling to stake on their custodial platform. I recommend staking in a wallet you control the keys to, but that is a choice for each individual. Please give the terms a look if you use/stake using coinbase.</p>\n\n<p>As always, do your own research and I don&#39;t know shit about fuck.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I believe the rates quoted by coinbase already have their fee factored in. I have attempted to contact support looking for clarity on this topic and have yet to receive a response.</p>\n\n<p>Edit2: it appears the staking fee varies by cryptocurrency. Some are higher than others.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
