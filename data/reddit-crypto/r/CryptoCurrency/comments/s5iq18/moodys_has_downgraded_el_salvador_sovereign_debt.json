(That they are capable of conning the common investor with their duplicitous analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many prominent leaders have commented on this issue- one of them is by former principal deputy associate attorney general Bill Baer, who had to say this about Moody&amp;#39;s:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Moody&amp;#39;s failed to adhere to its own credit rating standards and fell short on its pledge of transparency in the run-up to the Great Recession.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not just true for Moody&amp;#39;s but every other analysts would have a price attached to their heads. If you have connections and you sit in an influential position, you could pretty much influence the ratings of a bankrupt company. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a friendly reminder- most of these ratings don&amp;#39;t mean shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
