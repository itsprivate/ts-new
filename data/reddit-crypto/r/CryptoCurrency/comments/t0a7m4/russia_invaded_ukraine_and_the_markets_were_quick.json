ETH falls 10% as a result of a larger market decline. This post on CryptoPotato caught my attention because I&amp;#39;ve been investing in ETH for a few years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The article said: &amp;quot;ETH broke the support at $2,500. This opens the way for a potential drop towards $2,200, which is the first serious level to halt any further declines. The previous support at $2,500 has turned into resistance, and the market outlook is grim. The US stock market is due to open later today and may pull ETH lower still.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re all already dealing with high gas prices and delayed transactions, and we&amp;#39;re all looking for answers through various platforms, whether it&amp;#39;s Loopring, Metis, or something else, and now we&amp;#39;re facing such a drop that it&amp;#39;s truly a bad scenario. Do you have any concerns about it?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another news is that Russian-born Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin blasts Putin for Ukraine invasion as crypto nosedive said: &amp;quot;Ethereum is neutral, but I am not.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\nI believe that ETH is neutral but it is inevitable that this whole situation will affect its current value, as it has an impact on the entire crypto market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hnykd5081sj81.png?width=1813&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=86878fb11d2d997ca0c41f15a96464702dfe72b6\"&gt;ETH chart for 24th Feb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
