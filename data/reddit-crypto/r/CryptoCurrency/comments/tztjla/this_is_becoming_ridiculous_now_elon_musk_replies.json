Hamster Coin even had $3 million of volume in the last day as well (showing this is probably quite a few people speculating, not a low volume pump). &lt;strong&gt;The market cap now sits at just under $20 million!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is becoming absolutely ridiculous now. A coin with no functionality suddenly gaining hundreds of ranks on CMC for (pretty much) no reason. Evidently Musk isn&amp;#39;t going to buy Hamster Coin, but investors speculate regardless. At least with some previous tweets I can understand how one might believe that the coin has a future, but with this one it is so evident it doesn&amp;#39;t. Stuff like this is part of the reason crypto is seen as a scam by some people...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The coin currently only has 24% of its supply circulating, so this is going to be one hell of a rugpull. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr Don&amp;#39;t buy Hamster Coin and fuck scammers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
