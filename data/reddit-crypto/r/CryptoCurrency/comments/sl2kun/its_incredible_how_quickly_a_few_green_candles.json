But it was only a few days ago when everyone thought we were in the middle of a bear market, a few green candles later and it&amp;#39;s posts calling for altseason and short squeezes. It&amp;#39;s insane what one day of green does to people. Pumps are exciting, but we need to calm down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget we are still in a downtrend, and history shows that pumps can disappear as fast as they appeared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t make any reckless decisions, stick to the plans you made before this pump, and calm down a bit. You&amp;#39;ll do better if you stay humble and keep a level head on yourself. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
