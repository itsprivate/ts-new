An expert will come in a rearrange furniture or rent furniture out to give the house an appeal that results in FOMO.   Like you&#39;re getting all that nice shit?  Nah. </p>\n\n<p>We have 12 bushes in front of our house and I never really have a shit about them. I really don&#39;t give a FK about what my house looks like because of these bushes.  Whos it impressing?  In fact I was considering ripping them out anyway, and putting down cheaper ones that look nicer and cost only $50 a piece. \n But I never once thought the current bushes had any value until today... </p>\n\n<p>Was talking to my landscaper and he made a comment after I said I hated those bushes... &quot;I planted all these...wish I would have taken them when the owners left, everyone is asking for it&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>I said oh yeah? Why how much do they go for? </p>\n\n<p>He tells me at that size he can get about 500-600 a piece easy, and labor on top of it.</p>\n\n<p>You got to be fucking kidding me?  I also had about 10 or so of them in the back yard and a few on the side of the house. </p>\n\n<p>I told him will you take them for $250 each and plant the cheaper once I wanted instead?</p>\n\n<p>He gladly agreed. So now I&#39;m getting $6000 and new ones that I want on top of it.  I told my wife , and it was a no brainer.   I also have tons of rocks that I&#39;m dumping off too.  </p>\n\n<p>FK landscaping anyway.  More bushes more bugs, to me it&#39;s old people shit. They do nothing for my life.  They are essentially shit scam coins to me, and I have to stare at them everytime I look out the window.  $600 ???, they give me nothing in return and I have to maintain it?  Fk type of investment is that?  The maintenance cost out weighs the return. They take up space.   Get em the FK out of here.    Yes I&#39;m buying some moons too.  </p>\n\n<p>This is like a no risk situation for me. I get rid of stupid posh shit I don&#39;t want for stuff I do want and money.     I honestly would have never known the Bush&#39;s value if I did not mention anything about hating them.  </p>\n\n<p>So yeah. People want to FOMO over bushes that much.  Fk it. I&#39;ll take their money.   Stupid.</p>\n\n<p>Who would have thought their bushes could be used to go lambo?  Obviously not the no coiners buying them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
