About exactly 4 months ago end of sep/beginning Oct we were at the same cycle spot of disbelief. Disbelief meaning that the current rally is under disbelief by many as we were having so much downs and fake breakouts recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From sep we went from disbelief to complete euphoria in under a month. The great Uptober. It was the best time for me in crypto, daily big green candles and then that ATH melting faces. Complete euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well what happened after that is the turn of the cycle. Panic followed by capitulation and anger. Now we are back at the disbelief stage and ready for the next crazy ride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This four months show you the entirety of Crypto. Surving those are not easy, many did not. But those who did, hats off. We went through done dark times with the light at the end of the tunnel but are still back here, in the middle of the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As some Matt Damon once said &amp;quot;Fortune favors the brave&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
