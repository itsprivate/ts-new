How did we get here?</p>\n\n<p>Since Nayib Bukele announced that Bitcoin will become legal tender in El Salvador, you guys preferred profits over people. Why? Well, Nayib Bukele used his popularity to trick everyone he is a &quot;cool guy&quot;, willing to sacrify himself in the name of the people. But, yeah he is just a Trump-wannabe that uses people&#39;s ignorance to stay popular. For example, he is blaming George Soros for pretty much eveything:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9P\">https://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9P</a></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, everything: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/yRqyZV1\">https://imgur.com/gallery/yRqyZV1</a></p>\n\n<p>From accusing Human Rights Watch director ob being financed by George Soros: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/IyXFeBh\">https://imgur.com/gallery/IyXFeBh</a></p>\n\n<p>To accuse journalists of being paid by Soros: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/1CscRa4\">https://imgur.com/gallery/1CscRa4</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/JXUDigc\">https://imgur.com/gallery/JXUDigc</a></p>\n\n<p>And even accusing congressmen/congresswomen of being financed by Soros because they supported the Engel List (A list of corrupt politicians in Central America)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9P\">https://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9P</a></p>\n\n<p>Bonus track: Nayib Bukele even tried to interfere in a local US election, by asking people not to vote for a Congresswoman:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/A9ytFTB\">https://imgur.com/gallery/A9ytFTB</a></p>\n\n<p>You did it reddit, you are supporting a President who is using the same ultra right-wing tactics that Trump used. </p>\n\n<p>Now, what&#39;s going on right now in El Salvador? </p>\n\n<p>Darkness. No really, we are being left on the dark. The Parliament approved the Bitcoin Law in LESS than six hours, and it was done very late at night:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://diarioelsalvador.com/asamblea-cerca-de-aprobar-el-bitcoin-como-moneda-de-curso-legal/90324/\">https://diarioelsalvador.com/asamblea-cerca-de-aprobar-el-bitcoin-como-moneda-de-curso-legal/90324/</a></p>\n\n<p>Some of our congressmen didn&#39;t even know what they were voting for, for real:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/nacional/diputado-reynaldo-cardoza-no-entiende-bitcoin-apoyo-salvadorenos/871633/2021/\">https://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/nacional/diputado-reynaldo-cardoza-no-entiende-bitcoin-apoyo-salvadorenos/871633/2021/</a></p>\n\n<p>However, passing the law wasn&#39;t enough, since our country is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic. How is the government funding the Bitcoin Law? By reducing the education, and health budget and using that money to built the Bitcoin infraestructure: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Restan-fondos-a-Salud-Educacion-y-asignan-a-Ley-Bitcoin-20210830-0081.html\">https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Restan-fondos-a-Salud-Educacion-y-asignan-a-Ley-Bitcoin-20210830-0081.html</a></p>\n\n<p>(BTW I thought you guys were against reducing education budgets)</p>\n\n<p>How is that money being used? We don&#39;t know. All of the information regarding the construction of Chivo ATMs, purchasing Chivo ATMs, purchasing Bitcoins, and the USD $30 bonus is NOW classified information. There you have it, we don&#39;t know who was awarded the lucrative contracts to build and equipt the Chivo ATMs. </p>\n\n<p>That hasn&#39;t stopped Nayib Bukele of proudly making Bitcoin related announcements:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/jidE0oI\">https://imgur.com/gallery/jidE0oI</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/p26xqnl\">https://imgur.com/gallery/p26xqnl</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/RdYxP1f\">https://imgur.com/gallery/RdYxP1f</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/ZtNqni5\">https://imgur.com/gallery/ZtNqni5</a> (For real, no one knows about the costs of construction)</p>\n\n<p>People are against using Bitcoin as legal tender. They don&#39;t care if someone trades Bitcoin/Ethereum/Ada/Shiba/Solana, the people living in El Salvador don&#39;t want is as a legal tender. We already went through this with the Dollar, it was utter chaos. Protests are starting to gather more and more attention:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/Fs9Z9G9\">https://imgur.com/gallery/Fs9Z9G9</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/3xtJutO\">https://imgur.com/gallery/3xtJutO</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/HxpJKWR\">https://imgur.com/gallery/HxpJKWR</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/tlHMgUO\">https://imgur.com/gallery/tlHMgUO</a></p>\n\n<p>Trust me, people here are not prepared to use Wallets or trade Bitcoins. You really don&#39;t know the situation in El Salvador, where people can take pictures with a smartphone or upload videos but don&#39;t know what an email is or how to reply to one. Even worst, old people cannot even understand what a password is. If you think that we &quot;need to educate people about Wallets and Cryptocurrencies because it is the future&quot;, well come here and teach Salvadorans from rural areas about how to use a Wallet. Purchase a plane ticket and go to places like Cacaopera, Sesori, Chirilagua, San Alejo, Conchagua, and teach people about 2FA and Wallets. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am not against Cryptocurrencies. I have in my portfolio BTC, SOL, DODGE, ADA, ETH, and even DOT. I tried teaching people about Wallets, its uses and how easy is to send money across the country or the world. It is not an easy task, and it requires at least two years of educating people. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, I was banned from <a href=\"/r/BTC\">/r/BTC</a> for saying that people here in El Salvador will be forced to use BITCOIN. This morning, the government announced through a its legal advisor that we are obligated to accept payments in Bitcoins:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/84TrO9p\">https://imgur.com/gallery/84TrO9p</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
