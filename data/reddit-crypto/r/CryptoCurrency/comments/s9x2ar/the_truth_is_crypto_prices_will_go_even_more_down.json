Now imagine cryto prices declining(Or being stable) till march and then feds will decide to increase the interest rate. Imagine the amount of panic selling that would be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also when interest rates will be increased there would be less money in circulation so naturally less people will invest in crypto so it will go even more down&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am scared to say this that it may reach 20k$ or even less. Then only it can go up&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
