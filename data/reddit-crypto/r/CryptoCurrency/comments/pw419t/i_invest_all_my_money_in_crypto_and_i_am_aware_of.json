  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I  invest only in crypto and also invest most of my money in crypto. Two big  mistakes for most people here. I am aware about that. I could invest in stocks, silver or some other safer things. But it would be waste of money in my opinion. Those things are less profitable than crypto, so I would waste my time. For the same reason I invest  almost all of my money in crypto, not just some. But I can afford that, I am student, I live with parents, I have no girlfriend/wife  and no kids. I don&#39;t need most of my money.  I earned or saved them myself, so I can do whatever I want with those money without regrets. And I live in europe, so whatever shit  happen I still will not need my money, healthcare is &quot;free&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I do not buy shitcoins or believe in 1000x profits in few weeks. I risk, but I am not an idiot or gambler. I believe crypto is the future, and it will grow. I diversify between different coins. This is all well calculated. If crypto will grow a lot, in which I believe, I will be the winner. I think most people here are afraid too much. I believe in crypto technology. It will change the world and I want to be part of that. If it will go to zero I will be not sad cause  I lost some fiat, but because so beautiful idea failed. Fail of crypto would harm my pride and humanity more than my pocket.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be rich from crypto in few years. I don&#39;t want to keep investing  safe and wait 30/40 years, because it is waste of life.  If I will lose all invested money then fine, I am prepared for it.  I will be like  all those other people that never tried. Better try and lose than whole life ask &quot;what if?&quot;. Crypto is life time opportunity, last one was internet, but it was before I was even born. No no know what or when will be next one.</p>\n\n<p>People have small dreams or none at all. Average life, working 9-5 is not for me. I don&#39;t want family and boring job. Formal education do not give big opportunities. I still study at university, so I have doors open. I can have good  well paid job, but it still will be 9-5, working for someone else success. No thanks, I want have my own company, change word for better, not support rat race. Most people don&#39;t want to  persue their dreams. All people had dreams  as kids, most grow up and settled for reality, but some people still dream. I prefer to dream, invest in crypto and risk.</p>\n\n<p>I have a lot of hobbies, I love reading and dreaming. I don&#39;t want to be part of the crowd. I want to do great things. Maybe it is naive, maybe not. Crypto is my only way for that, I am poor, I see whole my life like people waste their lives. I will change my life thanks to crypto or even without it. I live in europe, so even if I would end homeless I would have  free healthcare, free food, free clothes and place in shelter. Even if I would have no money I would be fine. And in worst case I could travel around european union. All of it is better than lack of dreams. I believe thanks to crypto I will be rich, even if not, I will not stop trying.  Many successful people failed  or went bankrupt a lot of times before they achieved their dreams. What they had in common was that they never gave up.</p>\n\n<p>Of course it is not any advice, it is risky and probably not for most of people. It is just one of many  different ways to look on investing in crypto.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
