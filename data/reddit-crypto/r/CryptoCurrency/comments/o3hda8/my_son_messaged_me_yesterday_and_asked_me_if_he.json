C is my son, M is me:</p>\n\n<p>C: Hey I might buy into SHIBA INU</p>\n\n<p>C: buy like 100m shares and once it hits a penny or whatever. BOOM.</p>\n\n<p>M: lmfao</p>\n\n<p>C: Don&#39;t laugh at me</p>\n\n<p>M: If Shiba hit a penny it would be worth all the money currently in circulation (I hadn&#39;t done the math yet, until a couple of seconds later)</p>\n\n<p>M: It&#39;s not that extreme but to hit 0.01, its market cap would be $3,900,000,000,000 which is currently nearly 6x higher than Bitcoin&#39;s cap and 2.6x higher than the market cap of all crypto currently just to put it into perspective</p>\n\n<p>C: Oh</p>\n\n<p>M: Yeah there are 394 trillion SHIBA they did that probably to fool people into thinking they&#39;re getting a great deal by being able to buy over 1 million of them for $100 (I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the reason; I&#39;ve never really looked into SHIBA and haven&#39;t read the whitepaper, if they even have one)</p>\n\n<p>C: Having a million of them would be awesome though would you buy them for me if I sent you the money?</p>\n\n<p>M: If you want them so badly, buy them yourself.</p>\n\n<p>C (a couple of hours later): I can&#39;t figure out how to do it can you help me out please?</p>\n\n<p>M: Nah if you can&#39;t figure it out, you probably shouldn&#39;t be &#39;investing&#39; in SHIBA.</p>\n\n<p>C: wow you&#39;re being a dick</p>\n\n<p>M: It&#39;s called tough love, son</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I am being a dick. He gave me $100 in January and told me to invest in whatever I thought was good. I put it into ALGO for him. He gave me a point in which to sell (if/when the investment hits 10x) and hadn&#39;t messaged me about investing anything until Dogecoin FOMO hit him when it was around 0.60. This is the 2nd time he&#39;s messaged me about SHIBA, the first time was to get my opinion on it.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, I&#39;ll feel pretty bad if SHIBA goes the way of Dogecoin and ends up exploding even more than it already has, and his $1000 he wants to throw at it ends up being a multi-bagger for him. On the other hand, I&#39;m worried about him just hearing about some shit coin somewhere down the grapevine, investing and the rug being pulled out from under him.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s funny and sad how when I told him to invest in SHIBA himself, he got flustered and messaged me back admitting he couldn&#39;t figure it out and asking me to just do it for him. I know that he was trying to figure it out that entire ~2 hours but couldn&#39;t figure out how to use an exchange (that isn&#39;t Coinbase) to complete the transaction. I really meant what I said, that if he couldn&#39;t figure it out, that he shouldn&#39;t make the investment. </p>\n\n<p>I plan making the 3 hour drive up to see him next Wednesday when we&#39;re both off to hang out and to answer any of his crypto questions that he may have and that I am able to give an informed answer on. I&#39;m not sure what compelled me to share this; I just thought y&#39;all might like to see what someone who knows nothing about crypto&#39;s thought process (like him thinking that SHIBA will hit 0.01 without understanding market cap or just how many SHIBA are out there).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
