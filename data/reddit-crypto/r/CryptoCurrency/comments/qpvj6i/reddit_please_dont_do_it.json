It became, at some point, unbearable. Luckily, there were some regulations implemented so that it becomes a little bearable. But imagine a whole social media platform doing the same thing?</p>\n\n<p>I mean, yes, the first ambition -- the first goal which is to get those 500 million people aboard the crypto tech space, it&#39;s a doable, it&#39;s a purposeful goal, well, for cryptocurrency as a whole. I understand, we want mass adoption, sure, and 500 mil is a lot of heads.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is tho, I see a lot of spam accounts lately, and my god, those are very annoying. There&#39;s a lot of trash out there that are certainly, surely gaining attention. Should we anticipate misinformation everyday on every sub of points hoarders? Reddit, I came here for contents, alright. Good contents.</p>\n\n<p>All those paid shillers, with that additional benefit (if ever it is implemented) will get proper motivation to create more and more contents.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s what I think, and I don&#39;t need to convince you to agree with this. I think Reddit would just create another sub or I don&#39;t know, major sub? mini-Reddit? that will convert members&#39;s points to a crypto token. Do not mess Reddit as a whole, please. </p>\n\n<p>Well, again, this is my opinion. I&#39;m certainly no expert, there a people out there who specializes in certain areas like this, and I jsut want to write this to give my unsolicited sentiment about it.</p>\n\n<p>This sure is now longer than I expected it to be, so well bye.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
