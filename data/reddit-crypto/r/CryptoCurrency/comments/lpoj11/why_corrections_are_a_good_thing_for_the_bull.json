Bursting of local bubbles allow new investors to realize that crypto doesn&#39;t go straight up and make smarter investing decisions. Crashes however are bad as it signifies the end of the bull market, because it&#39;s when the general sentiment think BTC is overvalued and serves as a bigger wakeup call for panic selling, that would still accrue big gains for longtime HODLers.
