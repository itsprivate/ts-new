This report will analyse how Peter and the Griffin Family could have become rich through the purchase and Hodling of Bitcoin had they invested at that point in time.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>*** <strong>Part 1: Overview **\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<p>Family Guy - Season 14, Episode 11: <em>The Peanut Butter Kid</em></p>\n\n<p>Original Airdate: January 10, 2016 (Rotten Tomatoes 2021)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The Griffin family is struggling financially, and understands that some tight budgeting decisions need to be made. At exactly 01:17 into the episode, Peter announces his brilliant plan to help pull the Griffins out of the hell that is a low-middle income wage.</p>\n\n<p>The transcript is as follows….</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Lois Griffin:</em>  <code>Peter, every month our savings get smaller and smaller. We really gotta (sic) figure out a better way to budget for this family’s future!</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Peter Griffin:</em>  <code>…Bitcoin!</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Lois Griffin:</em>  <code>What?</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Peter Griffin:</em>  <code>I don’t know.</code></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6j3ggqouppe71.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6612ce990bd9b1e81d20db86f9c02b70e6c456d4\">Image 1: A shot of the now-famous scene. Please note Peter&#39;s hesitation and pure nervousness.... now THIS is what acting is all about. Powerful!</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the idea to invest in Bitcoin is very quickly dismissed. But what if the Griffins <em>had</em> decided to make that bold leap into the world of CryptoCurrency?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>*** <strong>Part 2: Market Snapshot (as of January 10, 2016) **\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<p>Figure 1 presents an idea of where Bitcoin was in terms of value (in USD) at the start of 2016.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5c6wo63zrpe71.png?width=1216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c7f60593eebedf0cae71d771554fa7c73fde43a\">Figure 1. From an ATH of $1 150 (approx) in 2014, BTC was hovering around $450 at the time the Family Guy episode aired in early 2016.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, Bitcoin was priced at approximately $450 USD as of January 10, 2016! This is the price at which Peter Griffin would theoretically have bought in. </p>\n\n<p>Comparing this to Bitcoin’s All Time High achieved in April 2021 (Figure 2):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v9dczap3tpe71.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdff6ee7eae4235d0f1e41a783c3265cb86b2e04\">Figure 2. BTC price from the original airdate to April&#39;s ATH.</a></p>\n\n<p>A price increase from $450 to $64 800 = a ROI (Return on Investment) of approximately <em>14 300 %.</em></p>\n\n<p>The following image indicates the writer’s reaction to such an ROI:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2mfa9r7etpe71.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b20376148cf7766e6e6cc90b4ef29dc421e413d\">Image 2  (Reference: WhatEmoji 2021)</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>*** <strong>Part 3: How much could the Griffins’ Realistically Invest? **\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<p>Calculating the size of the investment Peter and co. could put into Bitcoin will prove challenging, given we must make assumptions into the family’s finances. We will apply the following rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Only <em>discretionary income purchases</em> can be considered. We will reallocate all expenses from non-necessities purchased by the Griffins in Episodes 11-13 (around 1 month’s worth) and put them into Bitcoin; this will <em>not</em> include bills, transportation costs, etc., as these costs should ALWAYS come before investing (looking at you FOMOers).</p></li>\n<li><p>No hand-outs. As you other die-hard Family Guy fans will know, certain secondary characters such as Lois’ parents and Quagmire are reasonably-well off (or just stinking rich). We will assume that Peter does <em>not</em> ask anyone for financial help to buy Bitcoin, rather relying on his own discretionary income.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Below are the following discretionary income purchases made by the Griffins within one month of Season 14, Episode 11:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Episode 11:</em></p>\n\n<p>· 1 Cheap Metal Detector (approximate price): $200</p>\n\n<p>· Royalty Check – Stewie’s Commercial: $2 000</p>\n\n<p>· A tiny, tiny amount of cocaine: $300 for a gram</p>\n\n<p>· Voice-activated 3D printer: Ignored, as this was purchased using Stewie’s Royalty Check (counting this would include the Check twice)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Episode 12:</em></p>\n\n<p>· MLB (Baseball) Ticket + Hot Dog/Beer/Peanuts: $80 approximately</p>\n\n<p>· 8-10 Build-A-Bears: $150 approximately</p>\n\n<p>· 2 x Movie Tickets (based on the average ticket price in U.S., 2016 (Stoll 2021) ): $18 (rounded up)</p>\n\n<p>· Purple High-Tops: $180 approximately</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Episode 13:</em></p>\n\n<p>· Quahog Racket Club Membership (Upscale club in Rhode Island, month-long): $1 500</p>\n\n<p>· Bear-BnB (Bear-themed Air-BnB; 2 nights): $400</p>\n\n<p>· Flights/Vacation in Hawaii (two adults, cheap accommodation): $5 200 (BudgetYourTrip 2021)</p>\n\n<p>· Chemical Castration Cost (1 month’s cost): $1 000 (North 2019)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Total Discretionary Income: $11 028.</h1>\n\n<p>This is the amount available for Peter Griffin to invest into Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>*** <strong>Part 4: Conclusion **\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<p>At a price of $450 per Bitcoin, an investment of $11 028 would give the Griffins 24.5 Bitcoins (rounded down in consideration of fees). </p>\n\n<p>At Bitcoin’s ATH price on April 14, 2021, this investment would be worth……</p>\n\n<h1>$1.589 MILLION!</h1>\n\n<p>Peter Griffin and family would have become Crypto Millionaires had Peter made the decision to invest back on that fateful day in early January of 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading my post.
