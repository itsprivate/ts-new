While it is good advice, it is very possible that we experience a recession in the near future and having an emergency fund is really important right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who don&amp;#39;t know what an emergency fund is, it&amp;#39;s essentially a sum of money (yes, FIAT) that you set aside for large unexpected expenses such as job loss, unforeseen medical expenses, etc. I know current prices are tempting to just buy crypto but if and when we go into a recession, it&amp;#39;s better to be safe than sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The amount that you should put into an emergency fund is different for everyone and depends on what kind of support you would have if something happened. I generally stick to having enough stashed away to support myself for at least 3 months but depending on your situation, you may want more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s hard enough to set aside any money with prices being so high right now but having an emergency fund is more important than buying the dip.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
