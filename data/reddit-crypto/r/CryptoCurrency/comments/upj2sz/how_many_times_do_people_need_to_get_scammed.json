I saw a whole bunch of posts both here and on the luna subreddit that asked the obvious question: &amp;#39;If UST is backed by LUNA, what stops it from dropping if LUNA drops as well?&amp;#39; and being met with nothing but &amp;#39;this is FUD&amp;#39; comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then people here act surprised and sneer at others for saying they saw it coming. &amp;#39;Hindsight is 20/20&amp;#39; they say, except that&amp;#39;s not true in this case. Many, many people were saying this, they just didn&amp;#39;t want to listen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see so many warning signs and don&amp;#39;t listen, then you and your money would&amp;#39;ve been soon parted anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
