Right now they are expected to be about 8.5%, anything above that will be deadly for markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From July 26 to 27 we are gonna have the monthly FOMC meeting, there won&amp;#39;t be any rate hike suprises here but we should expect some big statements about the upcoming moves the FED and how they adjust their targets as 2.5% or 3.5% won&amp;#39;t be enough in any way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The by far biggest event is the Q2 GDP estimates on July 28th. After the confirmation that Q1 was even -1.6% to the estimated - 1.5% and the predicted  +1.1% we are only one GDP negative quarter away from a recession that so many in the US are denying. Even the consens of Atlanta FED is predicting a massive - 2.5% quarter.
