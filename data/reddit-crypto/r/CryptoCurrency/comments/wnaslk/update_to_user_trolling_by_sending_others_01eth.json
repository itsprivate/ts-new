While the block is enforced on the front end, the immediate effect is that unless users are very tech savvy and can interact with smart contracts directly, they cant access these apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the users Sassal0x who received funds from Tornado as the result of this trolling has reported that he has been blocked from Aave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2r7gqdixdgh91.jpg?width=1722&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7afee06b05018568ff9b2779bf900a5ff71e91a0\"&gt;This is the message that he is getting on Aave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These blocks are the result of the sanctions on Tornado Cash. Now a lot of people who themselves never interacted with Tornado, but were sent funds as part of a troll campaign have been blocked from even accessing various defi apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far the block is enforced on the front end so those blocked can access the dapps via alternate front ends, however it is not immediately clear if they could or would ban these addresses at the smart contract level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r1f53y294hh91.jpg?width=1694&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a5b6d4029e4723a9105e052a269ab83d7ce44bd4\"&gt;Even Vitalik has been blocked..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
