This is also not FUD, as anyone who is following the progress on tesnet can attest to there have been many major advances towards The Merge in the last several months.  It&amp;#39;s kind of a running theme in the ETH mining community how proof of stake has been &amp;quot;almost here&amp;quot; for years now, but this time it&amp;#39;s actually true we are nearing the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; To the folks saying I &amp;quot;made this up&amp;quot; or am spreading FUD or whatever, I&amp;#39;m just posting info to help keep cc up to date with the latest from a prominent ETH developer.  I like ETH, think it&amp;#39;s a great project, and am interested in its development.  A lot of casual ETH investors or miners were thinking The Merge might happen in June of this year, and this is the latest information to show that is unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
