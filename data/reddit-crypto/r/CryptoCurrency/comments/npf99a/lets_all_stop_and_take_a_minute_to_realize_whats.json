Yes we just experienced a major down trend, but seriously people...consider yourself lucky that you got to start in the infancy of crypto. Don’t think it’s the infancy? Here’s some stats for you. </p>\n\n<p>The FAANG stocks market caps. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Facebook $932.1 BILLION</li>\n<li>Apple $2.13 TRILLION</li>\n<li>Amazon $1.63 Trillion</li>\n<li>Netflix $222.95 Billion</li>\n<li>Google $1.62 Trillion </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For a grand total of $6.535 Trillion!</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s look at the top 5 Crypto</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bitcoin $694 billion</li>\n<li>Ethereum $306 billion</li>\n<li>Cardano $54 Billion</li>\n<li>BNB $53 Billion</li>\n<li>XRP $46 Billion</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For a whopping grand total of $1.153 Trillion</p>\n\n<p>That’s over 6X less than FAANG’s market cap. Btw FAANG’s aren’t even the top 5. If we do the actual top 5 (AAPLE, Microsoft, Amazon, Google &amp; Facebook) you get over $8 Trillion dollars!! </p>\n\n<p>Yes I know stocks aren’t the same as crypto. Let’s take a look at precious metals now. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Gold $12.129 Trillion</li>\n<li>Silver $1.538 Trillion</li>\n<li>Palladium $495 Billion</li>\n<li>Platinum $297 Billion</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Already we are at $14.459 Trillion for just the top 4. So precious metals top 5 are over 14X more than crypto’s top 5. </p>\n\n<p>So now we can all agree that there is still A TON of upside left. There is no way this is the top. Do not fear buying at these levels (my opinion). </p>\n\n<p>Next take a moment to realize that the crypto market is ALWAYS open! You can literally trade your crypto whenever you want. This is a day traders dream come true! Three day holiday weekend? You don’t have to wait a single second (unless your Coinbase app is frozen). How lucky are we that we can trade crypto 24/7/365?! </p>\n\n<p>And the one week killer bear/bull markets. Just this month we saw bitcoins price fall by more than 50% in a 10 day period!!! Can you say fire sale?! And let’s not forget coins double in value almost every day! This market is literally a rags to riches (or riches to rags) real life event. </p>\n\n<p>How many poor college students bought a few hundred dollars worth of DOGE in 2020 at .003 cents to see it go to over $0.70 in less than 6 months! That’s a 233X. One dollar invested would equal $233. Or $100 invested would net $23k!! </p>\n\n<p>Oh and I don’t get me started on all these super cool, FREE (minus taxes) airdrops. People who used uniswap got a whopping 400 free tokens (two weeks ago that would have been worth $16k). FO FREE?!?! What the heck is going on?! In the next month or two we should see another MAJOR airdrop for XRP holders (Flare Networks). This stuff is free money just for holding coins. </p>\n\n<p>BUT WAIT...There’s more! Are you sick and tired of getting less than 1% interest on your savings account? Well crypto’s got your back. There are coins that offer over 10% apy staking rewards. Wooooah! And apps like Crypto.com, Celsius, and many others that will pay you interest for most coins, just for having them in the app. Talk about a savings account on STEROIDS! </p>\n\n<p>I could go on all day long. This is an awesome time to be in an awesome market. Consider yourself very lucky and HODL on for your life! </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: We are still in the infancy of crypto. With 24/7 trading, airdrops, crazy volatility and great staking rewards, the crypto market is by far the coolest market out there. Consider yourself lucky!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
