  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; The existence of exchanges has made Bitcoins core claims completely irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; it is, at best, a toy. in reality it&amp;#39;s a massive disaster. to people who were scammed. to the environment. to victims of ransomware. the list goes on and on. right now a million crypto bros are dreaming up ways to do even more harm. and most damning of all, this is for absolutely nothing. there is no problem that a blockchain can solve that isn&amp;#39;t better solved by something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; You guys ask this shit every day, it gets so god damned old. You guys are so fucking obnoxious I can&amp;#39;t stand you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Simply put, crypto is nothing. It offers nothing. provides nothing. it is people speculating on the value of nothing being worth something but in the end it’s.nothing.  if you held a jar of a hobos dick cheese in your hand, you have something more intrinsically valuable than any amount of crypto. at least you have a jar which has its uses. For a bunch of people who think this is the mega game changer, they sure are spending a lot of time online, advertising money, and paid celebrities to try to convince us how amazing it is. Yet I don’t see the mass adoption 13 years later&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; What interest rate would you charge for a 30 year mortgage lent out in any non-stablecoin of your choice (because at best, stablecoins are only meant to mirror their pegged currency)? If you can&amp;#39;t give me an interest rate that approaches rates used today, then your currency will never (and &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; ever) be adopted as a true currency. If you&amp;#39;re just using it to gamble, then gamble away. Just don&amp;#39;t make any allusions about a possible future of actual adoption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; There would be no bitcoin in the madman future someone is preparing for. Unfortunately that&amp;#39;s against and old argument for crypto. They keep changing their &amp;#39;purpose&amp;#39; usually it contradicts itself and there is a new &amp;#39;purpose&amp;#39; everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; Volatility makes it useless. If I gave you $100 in BTC and it tanks in a day, I did well and you did not. Or the opposite and it goes up. Someone always loses in the transaction. It’s up and down so much even a few percent in a matter of hours. Sure that’s not a big deal for $20-$50 but it is if we’re talking thousands. My “fiat” doesn’t change that much that quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; Because it&amp;#39;s a negative sum Ponzi/pyramid hybrid scheme that has absolutely no real world value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s just like fiat cash, only way less secure, far less convenient, and with unbelievable teller fees.It’s a solution in search of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; My top argument is Crypto is reinventing what we already have. Fractional reserve banking = stablecoin. Fast transactions (lightning) = Visa. Distributed ledger = database  Exchanges = banks. Carbon converted to CO2 en masse = mining.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
