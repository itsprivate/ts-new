Cryptoland is the physical manifestation of the metaverse. Created by two brain dead visionaries to sell you yet again more worthless NFTs and tokens to equate to real land on a private island only for crypto visionaries to work, live, and play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can buy a 1 acre plot of real land to build a real house on, workout on a beachside crypto themed gym, eat at a crypto themed restaurant and bar. But what else? A ultra exclusive night club that is a members only club on a members only island than only special NFT holders can get into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cryptoland is designed for the new lifestyle of “digital nomads” who spend their lives in hotels and glued to charts on their phones then create content with quality TA about how what coin can go up, down, or sideways. The best part is there is a whole island of these assholes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to be sick…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
