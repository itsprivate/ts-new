Its main strength is precisely concerning privacy. Then it also has characteristics common to other virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin. Monero is in fact decentralized and scalable. This means that its value can increase or decrease in scale according to the need and availability of the currency itself. The name derives from Esperanto and in that language it means &quot;coin&quot;. Monero is also particular because it has a different system from the other virtual currencies derived from Bitcoins and is based on a protocol that is in fact called <strong>CryptoNote</strong>.  The system in question is based on different algorithms and it is no coincidence that it was also praised by one of the developers of Bitcoin Core, an authority in the field of virtual currencies such as Wladimir J. Van der Laan.</p>\n\n<h1>How does it work?</h1>\n\n<p>Monero uses, like other virtual currencies, a blockchain system for its transactions, but not very transparent as it is for the sisters of this virtual currency.  The measures adopted for the privacy of those who use Monero are: Ring signature, Stealth address and RingCT (Ring Confidential Transaction):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monero Ring Signature</strong>: The first of these three measures, Ring Signature, serves to hide where the money from a transaction made with Monero comes from. In fact, every single transaction carried out with Monero is inserted into a group of similar transactions: Monero enters the key of your account together with the public keys of other accounts present in the blockchain (using a triangular distribution method).  In this way, an outside observer will never be able to understand which of the keys of this group corresponds to the key of your account (from where the transaction takes place). In short, it is not possible to trace the source of a transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Stealth Address</strong>: The second measure taken by Monero serves to guarantee the privacy of those who will receive the money from the transaction. Each time a transaction occurs, the &quot;sender&quot; of the transaction must create an address (randomly) for the &quot;receiver&quot;, which is valid for one use only.  In practice, for each transaction that is carried out, a different address is generated (by Monero) for the recipient of the transaction. In this way, only the sender and the receiver are able to know where a transaction went “to end”.  In fact, in no way is it possible to find a connection between this address created for the receiver and the real address of the receiver. By doing so, the recipient&#39;s privacy is always protected.</li>\n<li><strong>RingCT (Ring Confidential Transaction)</strong>: The third measure taken by Monero is the RingCT, which serves to hide the amount exchanged in individual transactions. This is precisely one of the latest measures implemented by Monero to protect the privacy of its users.  When a transaction with Monero is made, the sender must enter his entire wallet as an input. As the output of the transaction, however, the sender must enter two information:  The first output that the sender must enter is the amount of Monero that he really wants to send to the recipient  The second output that the sender must enter is the remaining amount of their wallet, which will be sent &quot;back&quot; to their wallet in the form of change  The transaction is verified with a simple calculation, that is: the two outputs that must equal the input entered are added. In this way it is proven by the system that no new Monero were created during the transactions. Also, the amounts entered for these transactions are never shown.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Where to store it?</h1>\n\n<p>The best hot wallets for XMR are MyMonero, MoneroGUI, and CakeWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.</p>\n\n<h1>Pros&amp;Cons</h1>\n\n<p>*DISCLAIMER* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>One of the most private cryptocurrencies</li>\n<li>Great devs team</li>\n<li>Monero can be profitably mined using CPU’s as well as GPUs</li>\n<li>Probably the most decentralized systems</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Centralization of miners on Monero</li>\n<li>Monero has quickly found a place as the currency of choice on Dark Web sites</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
