Most of the time investigations are handled behind the scenes so the culprits do not learn our methods and evade them, but in certain cases like this one I believe it is good to show people what to look out for.  Some background, more resources about digital manipulation, and a prior report can be found <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/d1qneb/crypto_reddit_manipulation_report_dream_network/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: Visit any of the links below at your own risk.</strong>  Some are NSFW and others are redirects that may send you to an unknown location.  You may want to use a tool like <a href=\"https://wheregoes.com/\">https://wheregoes.com/</a> to examine redirect chains more safely, though these tools aren&#39;t bulletproof either</p>\n\n<h1>The Fun Space Group</h1>\n\n<p>The Fun Space group arrived on our radar recently for posting redirect links mainly across <a href=\"/r/CryptoMarkets\">r/CryptoMarkets</a> and smaller crypto subs.  This is against Rule 1 in both subs because automod evasion obviously makes moderating harder, but it also sends the user to a destination they don&#39;t expect.  This might be done immediately or they might wait for the post to become popular and then sell it to a porn/malware distributor <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/e0y94v/segwit_adoption_hits_another_ath_scaling_working/\">as seemingly happened here</a>.  There is very little, if any, legitimate use for redirect domains and it is very inorganic behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The typical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi\">MO</a> for these bots is to periodically spam these redirect domains across 5 to 10 subreddits, always with a similar title and using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain\">TLD</a> like .fun or .space.  Note, this is not limited to crypto, I found several cases where it included gaming, science, and merchandise targeted spam as well.  You&#39;ll also see that these redirect posts are always upvoted to somewhere around 40 to 100 points, even though they are low quality and often posted in dead subs, which is clear <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/vote_manipulation\">vote manipulation</a></p>\n\n<p>A quick glance at these accounts might not look fishy because between spam campaigns they always have organic looking comments.  After digging a little deeper I noticed a few things.  These comments were in popular posts I had seen on <a href=\"/r/all\">r/all</a> and they always had a lot of comments.  If you load all comments and ctrl+F &quot;title are hilarious&quot; <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/lg7gnv/not_very_tall_tale/\">in this post</a>, you&#39;ll see what I found.  3 different accounts placed the exact same comment in that thread.  What these bots are doing to simulate organic activity is finding popular threads on <a href=\"/r/all\">r/all</a> and just copying an existing comment.  Usually they are among of hundreds or thousands of comments, so a human would never notice.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rytron3000om\">https://www.reddit.com/user/rytron3000om</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210212012912/https://old.reddit.com/user/rytron3000om/\">archive</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Slavaighhj\">https://www.reddit.com/user/Slavaighhj</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210215150255/https://old.reddit.com/user/Slavaighhj\">archive</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rorimpotaFJ\">https://www.reddit.com/user/rorimpotaFJ</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210215150324/https://old.reddit.com/user/rorimpotaFJ\">archive</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/realgagneWJ\">https://www.reddit.com/user/realgagneWJ</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210215150510/https://old.reddit.com/user/realgagneWJ\">archive</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Krapja9v\">https://www.reddit.com/user/Krapja9v</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BaDeanAko099\">https://www.reddit.com/user/BaDeanAko099</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lilspicerxova\">https://www.reddit.com/user/lilspicerxova</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lusttforli\">https://www.reddit.com/user/lusttforli</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lbsdnvyp\">https://www.reddit.com/user/lbsdnvyp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wolfcubwolfc\">https://www.reddit.com/user/wolfcubwolfc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kicheljek0\">https://www.reddit.com/user/kicheljek0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/georginasa\">https://www.reddit.com/user/georginasa</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RumiOJ\">https://www.reddit.com/user/RumiOJ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ziarnica7p\">https://www.reddit.com/user/ziarnica7p</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/freiherzyky\">https://www.reddit.com/user/freiherzyky</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGetBizy\">https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGetBizy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Osieczycec4\">https://www.reddit.com/user/Osieczycec4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Therockerroll\">https://www.reddit.com/user/Therockerroll</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We have taken steps to prevent this kind of activity in the future and have of course banned all of these accounts, but awareness is important too.
