I saw it posted today), a company called &amp;quot;CoinShares&amp;quot; published &lt;a href=\"https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-2022\"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; that tries really hard to push the narrative that BTC is totally not bad for the environment and that all of that is FUD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who is CoinShares? A company whose &amp;quot;mission is to expand access to the digital asset ecosystem&amp;quot; - in other words, a company that is dependent on crypto succeeding. If you read the report and you don&amp;#39;t have rose-colored glasses, that becomes obvious for you - even though they pick the numbers most favorable for them, they find that BTC accounts for only 0.08% of CO2 emitted worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about that, that&amp;#39;s almost a thousandth of all CO2 - for something that really isn&amp;#39;t used all that much. That number is huge, and probably even higher in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a laughable effort of declaring BTCs environmental problems FUD. In a few decades, when we hopefully have mostly solved crypto&amp;#39;s environmental problems, we will look back at studies like that the same way we regard &lt;a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/cigarette-ads-doctors-smoking-endorsement\"&gt;cigarette ads from the 1930s and 1940s&lt;/a&gt; with doctors saying they are not at all bad for your health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Change my mind!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
