You maybe wondering which country it is. It&amp;#39;s located in South East Asia called Nepal. I&amp;#39;ve been into crypto space for almost a two year now and it&amp;#39;s like living in the future. Recently Three people got arrested and four member of the same family got arrested for trading cryptocurrency. Kudos to those who got arrested. May satoshi be with you. Fuck this country man so tired of this fucking government fuck the system. I&amp;#39;m so frustated and deperessed reading these types of news warning about cryptocurrency. The government doesnot give a fuck about development it&amp;#39;s all corrupted from the root. I want to keep a low profile now but fuck man talk about freedom nothing like this actually exist we are just bind by the shitty rules made by government. kudos to those who live in a country where you can hold and trade cryptos freely and can experience financial freedom. I have huge respect for those country. I want to get out of this shithole country and do what I want freely. So yeah good bye to the &lt;a href=\"/r/CC\"&gt;r/CC&lt;/a&gt; community but I&amp;#39;ll be back when they make crypto Legal or meet a point where I don&amp;#39;t give a fuck and keep trading and holding crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5avwrsbuz7e81.png?width=847&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2b7fa19d4a25a48121756c92499a094425f35e02\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5avwrsbuz7e81.png?width=847&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2b7fa19d4a25a48121756c92499a094425f35e02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ihxg5vbuz7e81.png?width=736&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=302b853ad5746fa4fd30f68dbdd5a3435c79ba89\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ihxg5vbuz7e81.png?width=736&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=302b853ad5746fa4fd30f68dbdd5a3435c79ba89&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
