Why are we still learning the basics here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Saying &amp;quot;we are still early&amp;quot; is setting yourself up for wildly unrealistic expectations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are still early. There is no doubt about it. For perspective, only &lt;a href=\"https://nairametrics.com/2020/06/18/ethereum-wallets-holding-at-least-0-1-eth-just-crossed-the-3-million-mark-for-the-first-time/\"&gt;3 million ETH wallets&lt;/a&gt; have more than 0.1 ETH in them. There are 8 BILLION people on this planet and they all need financial services. You are as early as you can be. Even Bitcoin active wallets only crossed 65 million active users recently. Do the math. It&amp;#39;s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;TA YouTubers are full of sh*t&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YouTubers are here to make money for themselves, not for you. If you want them to paint a bullish scenario just because you want your bags to go up they will. Their content is determined by metrics and your Google searches. If you want to feel bullish they will make you feel bullish because that brings in more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you can&amp;#39;t find reasonable people out there. Some that I follow are expecting BTC to go down to 30K before we can make a significant rebound. Are they also full of shit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whitepaper&amp;#39;s today is nothing more than a long list of promises like that of a politician&amp;#39;s manifesto before election! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you not find it suspicious that people asking for money up front can&amp;#39;t even bother to give you a working product to try first? Whitepapers are there for show and none of them should be taken seriously. This is something we all learned during the ICO era, why do we have to reevaluate the same shit over and over again?  They all smell like manure so treat them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspective is everything in crypto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem may lie in the unrealistic expectations new people are fed with as soon as they step into the crypto industry. Before you can talk reason into them they will find Bitboy crypto and he will tell them that Ripple is going to $250 in 2022 while also lying that he is an expert on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard truth is that no one knows what they are actually doing. We can&amp;#39;t know if Ethereum will be here in 10 years even though it may seem obvious today. What if they don&amp;#39;t fix the issue with fees and people just find something different but equally useful?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are running a marathon&lt;/strong&gt; and anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. If you want to &amp;quot;make it&amp;quot; in crypto you need to commit to something. Find a project that resonates with your personal beliefs and moral values, get involved, stack the token over time and reap the rewards once people recognize the value you saw years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is really not that hard if you stop listening to idiots. NO ONE KNOWS what they are talking about when it comes to long-term investments. Just find something that makes sense to you and mute the noise. It won&amp;#39;t get you anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If all those influencers actually made generational wealth with crypto they would have no time to record videos, make stupid faces in the thumbnail and lie all day for a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
