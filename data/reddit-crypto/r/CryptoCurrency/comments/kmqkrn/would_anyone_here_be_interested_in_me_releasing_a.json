My aim is to have it as a site-wide free service. I&#39;m also not sure how it would because the bot would need to have a certain age and karma to post in some subreddits?</li>\n<li>Does anyone have any other ideas I can add to it?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Also if people don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good fit for most of Reddit but like the idea in general, I will most likely have a daily summary page which will be posted here:</strong> <a href=\"/r/SatoshiStreetBets\">r/SatoshiStreetBets</a></p>\n\n<p>Since I have the tools mostly in place I anticipate a day or so and it would be ready.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
