They&#39;re fighting hedge funds and other big institutions while you, by pumping DOGE, are just making a person lose, not an institution. You&#39;re not fighting anyone worthy, you&#39;re just promoting pumps and dumps, which is one of the bad things that can happen in crypto.</p>\n\n<p>Sure DOGE went up +300% in the last 24h, but that&#39;s just because <a href=\"/r/SatoshiStreetBets\">r/SatoshiStreetBets</a> decided to pump it. Right now everyone who&#39;s pumping as well is happy, but soon the downfall will be evident. Don&#39;t support pumps and dumps, support crypto in general. Pumps and dumps will only show the world that maybe crypto isn&#39;t that safe when in fact, it is safe, from an investing point of view but also to be used in our daily life.</p>\n\n<p>I know 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE, but still, be a good boy, please.  </p>\n\n<p>edit: <a href=\"/r/SatoshiStreetBets\">r/SatoshiStreetBets</a> doing it, not <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
