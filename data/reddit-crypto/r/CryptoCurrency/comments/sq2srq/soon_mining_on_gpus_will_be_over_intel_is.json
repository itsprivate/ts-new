  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital computing continues to enrich our lives in more ways than we  can imagine. We acquire, consume, and create content and services with a  few clicks or taps of our fingertips. Exponential increases in compute  performance, enabled by Moore’s Law, play a significant role in making  these experiences seamless. Moore’s Law is also enabling us to  democratize access to this enormous pool of processing power. Amazing  things happen when a lot of compute is available to a lot of people  without much friction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to the next set of amazing things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blockchain  is a technology that has the potential to enable everyone to own much  of the digital content and services they create. Some even call it an  inflection point in computing, fundamentally disrupting the way we  store, process and transact our digital assets as we usher in the era of  metaverse and Web 3.0. No matter how the future evolves, it is certain  the availability of a lot more compute to everyone will play a central  role.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, we at Intel are declaring our intent to contribute to  the development of blockchain technologies, with a roadmap of  energy-efficient accelerators. Intel will engage and promote an open and  secure blockchain ecosystem and will help advance this technology in a  responsible and sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are mindful that some  blockchains require an enormous amount of computing power, which  unfortunately translates to an immense amount of energy. Our customers  are asking for scalable and sustainable solutions, which is why we are  focusing our efforts on realizing the full potential of blockchain by  developing the most energy-efficient computing technologies at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our  blockchain accelerator will ship later this year. We are engaged  directly with customers that share our sustainability goals. Argo  Blockchain, BLOCK (formerly known as Square) and GRIID Infrastructure  are among our first customers for this upcoming product. This  architecture is implemented on a tiny piece of silicon so that it has  minimal impact to the supply of current products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intel Labs has  dedicated decades of research into reliable cryptography, hashing  techniques and ultra-low voltage circuits. We expect that our circuit  innovations will deliver a blockchain accelerator that has over 1000x  better performance per watt than mainstream GPUs for SHA-256 based  mining. You will be able to learn more about our circuit innovations at  the International Solid State Circuit Conference (ISSCC) this month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To  support this, and additional emerging technology, we have formed the  new Custom Compute Group within Intel’s Accelerated Computing Systems  and Graphics business unit. The objective of this team is to build  custom silicon platforms optimized for customers’ workloads, including  blockchain and other custom accelerated supercomputing opportunities at  the edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Onward, we aspire to leverage technologies from our  zetta-scale computing initiative to deliver energy-efficient solutions  that make our tomorrow better than our today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Raja M. Koduri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n &lt;em&gt;Senior vice president and general manager of the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group at Intel Corporation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://videocardz.com/press-release/intel-announces-energy-efficient-blockchain-accelerators-and-new-custom-compute-group\"&gt;Link to VideoCardz article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
