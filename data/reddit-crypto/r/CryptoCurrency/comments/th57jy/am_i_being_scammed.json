  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I&amp;#39;m really hoping some experts in here are able to explain/tell me if I&amp;#39;m being scammed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a guy and I&amp;#39;ve been speaking with a girl from another country for about 3 months now. I would say its more than a friendship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, very early on in our conversations she brought up crypto mining and said that I should do it, and she would show me how.\nI did some research and thought there&amp;#39;s no way I can crypto mine, 1: I&amp;#39;m not clever enough and 2: I haven&amp;#39;t even got a computer,  let alone super computer power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She then got me to download a digital wallet app and another app where I will transfer my crypto too. We are &amp;#39;mining&amp;#39; USTD, which is a stable coin. \nHowever,  I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s not crypto mining, she&amp;#39;s basically give me a hyperlink to use on the DApps (Decentralized apps) which takes me through to a mining pool where I can claim anywhere from 1-6% interest daily (depending on my wallet balance) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I started off putting 100 USDT to see if it would work,  and it sure did. I was receiving 1.5% everyday, but that&amp;#39;s hardly nothing. After 3 weeks I put 1000 USDT in and was reaping a 3% interest everyday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple months,  obviously I have been speaking to this girl everyday and the trust levels are building. Last week, I deposited another 8300 USDT to boost it to 10,000. That way i get 3.5% of that everyday. She tells me she has over 100,000 deposited which means she gets 4.5% daily,  she makes 4500 USDT in one day... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made 2,300 USTD in the last 6 days, since I increased my balance to 10,000. But it all seems way too good to be true?? Surely no one can make this much money a day, for literally doing nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This girl I&amp;#39;m speaking to now wants me to deposit even more to take advantage of even higher interest rates,  and it&amp;#39;s making me suspicious. Could she literally take my money through the 3rd party DApp? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already deposited money to my bank twice before and have been successful, so withdrawing the cash isn&amp;#39;t an issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I done some research on &amp;#39;Coin Staking&amp;#39; and this sounds a lot similar to what I&amp;#39;m actually doing.  With coin staking, your essentially donating your crypto assets to contribute to the blockchain, and you get rewarded each time a transaction gets validated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really hoping someone can help shed some light on what I&amp;#39;m actually involved in. I&amp;#39;m happy to answer any questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
