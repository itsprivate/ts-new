The price goes up by 20%. Now I have 120â‚¬. If I now sell and buy again - and disregard the transaction fees - and the price rises again by 20%, I am at 144â‚¬. If I had not sold, it would have risen by 40% and I would only have 140â‚¬.

So I try to explain the thing again and already during this I realize that it sounds really dumb.\nMy friends laugh at me and I cry (mentally).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: That math professor thing is a joke&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
