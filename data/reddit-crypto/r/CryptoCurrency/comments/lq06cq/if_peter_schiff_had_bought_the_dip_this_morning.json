Clearly he is obsessively watching cryptocurrency if he is there complaining constantly about BTC all the way from &lt;$4k to over $58k and then tries to gloat immediately after a pullback to $48k as if he was right (which has already bounced to $54k). Meanwhile, his gold is struggling to break the highs from 10 years ago, and has significantly under-peformed both the stock market and crypto.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
