But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we can&amp;#39;t still have some fun right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those that were around at the beginning of the year, you might remember that I created this. The FOLIO OF HATE. I invested (yolo&amp;#39;d?) $100 into this subs most hated coins. Some coins are hated because of utility, some because of corruption, some because of the the shills. Whatever the reason, I decided to act on the theory that this sub can actually pick winners by investing into the ones that we all hate the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, $100 was invested on the same day to each of the ten coins/tokens. Here is how it fared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nfz7ezwmz8y81.png?width=991&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d0ac739a8375280fe14e47eb7564c5a1d6d7fc0e\"&gt;Folio of Hate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Down 46% or $460 in five months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about the individual results? Surely they&amp;#39;re not all bad? Right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best performer:&lt;/strong&gt; USDT -0.01 %&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worst performer:&lt;/strong&gt; LRC -70.13 %&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise Performer:&lt;/strong&gt; DOGE -31.01%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mbx8ck2j09y81.png?width=1007&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=87d85fccc2bb402f75ac9b570a37b9cd73b866ec\"&gt;Folio of Hate Individual Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal points of interest:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investing in Dogecoin - yes Dogecoin - was a better investment than Solana, Cardano, Ripple and Binance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Safemoon was not the predicted worst performer ...yet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tether - FUCKING TETHER - was the folios best performer. Props to &lt;a href=\"/u/entschida\"&gt;u/entschida&lt;/a&gt; for getting that one right.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am aware that perceptions and opinions shift over time, so it is of course possible that we hate these coins more than ever. Oh, and fuck you Crypto.com&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original post from &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rng996/here_it_is_the_subs_most_despised_coins_combined/\"&gt;five months ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I&amp;#39;ll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won&amp;#39;t let me create a post with that many coin names in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
