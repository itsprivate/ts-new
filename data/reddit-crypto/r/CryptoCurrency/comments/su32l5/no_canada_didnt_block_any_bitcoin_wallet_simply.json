That&amp;#39;s totally different than blocking a wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is free and always will be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody can stop those people to use their BTC how they want. They can pay anyone they want and no government can block a transaction in the blockchain. What they can&amp;#39;t do is to send btc to a Canadian exchange and to convert it to fiat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think most people forgot that Bitcoin was created in order to be an international currency free from any government control, and nothing changed. If people use btc just to make a profit and then convert it to fiat, that&amp;#39;s not Satoshi&amp;#39;s fault and not his original idea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t sympathize with the convoy protest, I don&amp;#39;t really care about it, I just don&amp;#39;t like the idea that governments can control or block anyone&amp;#39;s money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If everyone would start accepting payments on btc (or any other crypto) no government could block or control the economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, any exchange not located in Canada could easily accept those btc because they&amp;#39;re not under Canadian jurisdiction. I&amp;#39;m sure Gate, Coinex, Kucoin and similar have no problems about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
