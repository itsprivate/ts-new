This was the first time that the concept was proved on a major scale. BTC, and crypto in general, would not be as big of a thing without all of the escorts who pushed it along through facilitating millions of dollars in transactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a little inside history for anybody who didn’t know these things.
