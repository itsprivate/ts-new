(It’s debatable whether proof of stake is superior or proof of work but I won’t go into that). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than being the most adopted smart contract platform and being “first to market,” is Ethereum actually technically better than most other Layer 1s out there?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong I’m bullish on Ethereum, but I’m even more bullish on other Layer 1s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
