Staking and methodology</h1>\n\n<p>Staking cryptocurrencies is something that may interest a lot of retail investors who do not wish to participate in active trading. Staking allows a coin holder to receive passive income through a reward or forging system.</p>\n\n<p>The number of coins or tokens that you have or the amount you are willing to stake will affect the quantity of staking rewards. It’s a bit like a savings account but with much greater freedom and a decent profit.</p>\n\n<p>Staking is in its essence basically a form of mining, that rewards the users of the blockchain network, because the users of the specific project chose who their Node operators and ultimately Staking providers are. These operators are called miners for coins like Bitcoin. However, staking uses fraction of electricity and computational power that bitcoin mining needs, while still keeping the network running. Poetry of blockchain engineers.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to make a comprehensive guide that will cover a glossary regarding staking and other blockchain terms. The main take-away should be a closer look at a list of projects that I will compare based on how profitable, prospective and user-friendly they are.</p>\n\n<p>The choice of projects featured includes popular, innovative and original projects. I have either direct experience with these projects or I have researched and tested them out. In my opinion, these projects are relatively low risk.</p>\n\n<p>I studied 40+ projects and eventually limited my choice to 9 blockchain networks. This journey was actually really interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Before starting it, I was staking in 2 projects and I thought the market was flooded with projects covering insane staking rewards and incredible possibilities. I went to the opposite end of what I know from my experience and researched ERC20 staking – realizing it is complex and risky.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I focused on user experience and risk mitigation. This led to a rabbit hole of discovering new and amazing projects. I slowly started to realize one very common denominator for the best staking projects. All of them are focused on creating technology for block-chain interoperability, deploying their own blockchains and parachaining. Each has its own unique take on how to solve this crucial factor for adoption (covered in Chapter 4). This reasoning is clearer when you understand the difference between Proof-of-work and Proof-of-stake.</p>\n\n<p>The foundation of the tech behind the projects should be a major point of interest when comparing these products over their profitability. One of the deciding factors was also the development activity behind these projects (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub\">https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub</a>). That is why extreme profit projects with 0 tech are not listed here.</p>\n\n<p>To make this guide a bit more interesting I had a couple of crypto beginners try out this selection of projects and noted their opinion in the evaluation part of this guide.</p>\n\n<p>If you feel that this list excludes an interesting project, please comment and list some sources. I will edit the post and add them in.</p>\n\n<p>Important notes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Any project with less than 3% annual rewards is not included (eg. EOS, NEO, TRON, VET, LSK, XLM).</li>\n<li>As mentioned, sometimes there is a risk associated with staking (usually very high-profit types with 20% and more yearly interest). This means that any project that has a risk of losing the staked amount or significant rewards is also excluded.</li>\n<li>ERC20 tokens are also excluded as their staking is more complicated and riskier. DOT and KSM are exceptions because their slashing is negligible for users (not validators, however).</li>\n<li>Exchange staking is included briefly as it also carries a risk but that is mainly in the concept of not your keys, not your coins axiom.</li>\n<li>I decided not to include ETH 2.0 in this guide, because it means locking a large number of assets until it launches (so do your own research after you finish this guide).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>1. TLDR: Summary for Staking in Native Wallets</h1>\n\n<p>I decided to start this post with a summary, because there would be a wall of text before the “good stuff”. I hope this summary will motivate you to read through the rest of the post and find the logic and reasoning behind it. I decided not to give any project an overall rank and listed them alphabetically (there is no best to last, that is for you to decide). Instead, I summarized key features, profitability and evaluated UIX (from crypto-beginners) and tech aspects (by studying whitepapers and roadmap completions).</p>\n\n<p>Some projects have grown in a way that staking was always available only in third-party wallet and since that is their native environment, they deserve a place here.</p>\n\n<p>Staking in native wallets will always be the most secure way to stake your coins. Never forget to back‑up your seed phrases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If some terminology in this table is not clear – head down to the glossary in the next chapter. Every single evaluation category in the table is explained in project overview of Chapter 4.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Table 1: Native wallet - profitability</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Project</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Coin</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Native Wallet</th>\n<th align=\"left\">APY %</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Lock-up period</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Pay-out</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Algorand</td>\n<td align=\"left\">ALGO</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">6.5 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">None</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Transaction claim</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">ARK EcoSystem</td>\n<td align=\"left\">ARK</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">8-9.5 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">None</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Daily</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Avalanche</td>\n<td align=\"left\">AVAX</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">9.2 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14-365 days</td>\n<td align=\"left\">After lock</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Cardano</td>\n<td align=\"left\">ADA</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes*</td>\n<td align=\"left\">4-5 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">None</td>\n<td align=\"left\">20 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Cosmos</td>\n<td align=\"left\">ATOM</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3rd - party only</td>\n<td align=\"left\">10.5 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Variable**</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Claiming with fees</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">ICon</td>\n<td align=\"left\">ICX</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">13 %***</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5-20 days</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5-20 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Kusama</td>\n<td align=\"left\">KSM</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">7days</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Claim (21 days expire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Polkadot</td>\n<td align=\"left\">DOT</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">9-12 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">28 days</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Claim (84 days expire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Tezos</td>\n<td align=\"left\">XTZ</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3rd - party only</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5-6 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Initial lock****</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3 days ****</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>*ADA native wallets are developed by third-party but they are exclusive to ADA</p>\n\n<p>** ATOM locking period depends on user but to switch delegation you have to wait 21 days.</p>\n\n<p>** ICX interest changes a lot, can be from 6-30 %, overall is about 10–16 %</p>\n\n<p>*** Tezos requires to initially confirm assets for about 14-20 days.

As usual around main-net launches the price rocketed and is now consolidating. The staking rewards are decent for AVAX, however, setting up staking accounts is a bit more tricky for beginners. There is a variable lock-up period that the user can freely choose from and rewards are received after this period. They have yet to prove what they promised in whitepapers, but the ambitions are interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Their main net is pretty interesting though: <a href=\"https://www.avalabs.org/why-avalanche\">https://www.avalabs.org/why-avalanche</a></p>\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.avalabs.org/\">https://www.avalabs.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>Reddit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/</a></p>\n\n<p>How to stake:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/avalancheavax/staking-avax-by-validating-or-delegating-with-the-avalanche-wallet-f4d9adc182a6\">https://medium.com/avalancheavax/staking-avax-by-validating-or-delegating-with-the-avalanche-wallet-f4d9adc182a6</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview/staking\">https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview/staking</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/nodes-and-staking/staking-avax-by-validating-or-delegating-with-the-avalanche-wallet\">https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/nodes-and-staking/staking-avax-by-validating-or-delegating-with-the-avalanche-wallet</a></p>\n\n<p>Upcoming tech:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.avalabs.org/whitepapers\">https://www.avalabs.org/whitepapers</a></p>\n\n<h2>Cardano (ADA):</h2>\n\n<p>Also a project from 2017 that probably will have the biggest recognition on this list. They never failed to deliver what they promised and should be considered one of the most solid projects in this list.</p>\n\n<p>Their might have one of the lesser staking profitability on this list but they make up for it with the great ease of staking. Rewards are paid out automatically every 20 days and the assets of the addresses are never locked. Calculations are done daily so it considers your transaction history during the 20 days. Therefore it is risk free. Their “native” wallets Daedalus and Yoroi are easy-to-use.</p>\n\n<p>Some great news are coming from Cardano in the upcoming months so be sure to have them on your watch list. They recently hard-forked to allow more interoperability with chained tokens. They are also very active in development (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub\">https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub</a>). They are a Top 3 crypto project for a reason. </p>\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://cardano.org/\">https://cardano.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>Reddit:</p>\n\n<p>How to stake: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUZKSS_cJIE&amp;ab_channel=IOHK\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUZKSS_cJIE&amp;ab_channel=IOHK</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCMX1wFgrJY&amp;ab_channel=IOHK\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCMX1wFgrJY&amp;ab_channel=IOHK</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/cardanorss/staking-for-beginners-a-step-by-step-guide-6dda110b2454\">https://medium.com/cardanorss/staking-for-beginners-a-step-by-step-guide-6dda110b2454</a></p>\n\n<p>Tech: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cardano.org/discover-cardano\">https://cardano.org/discover-cardano</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://why.cardano.org/\">https://why.cardano.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>Upcoming tech: <a href=\"https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/\">https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/</a></p>\n\n<h2>Cosmos (ATOM):</h2>\n\n<p>Cosmos has generous profitability and decent ease of staking. The coin can be staked in many wallets due to integration of their SDK in them in order to vote for Staking Pools. The only tricky part is the fact that you have to claim your rewards with a fee to the network. </p>\n\n<p>Cosmos launched in Q1 of 2019 and they just recently finished their first whitepaper and launched their new road map of Stargate.

Both have one of the most profitable stake value in their native wallets and exchange staking. However, the ease of staking in their native wallets is pretty hard for beginners. This coupled with lock up periods and claiming rewards and their possible expiration does not create a good user experience. One could compare that the profitability makes up for that but having it on your mind all the time is a negative experience. </p>\n\n<p>However, they are backed by huge VC and have very ambitious tech lined up. They have yet to prove what they are capable of.</p>\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://kusama.network/\">https://kusama.network/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://polkadot.network/\">https://polkadot.network/</a></p>\n\n<p>Reddit: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Kusama/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Kusama/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dot/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/dot/</a></p>\n\n<p>How to stake:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/stakin/how-to-stake-kusama-ksm-4529a48bb4e8\">https://medium.com/stakin/how-to-stake-kusama-ksm-4529a48bb4e8</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168057-how-do-i-stake-nominate-on-polkadot-\">https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168057-how-do-i-stake-nominate-on-polkadot-</a></p>\n\n<p>Tech: <a href=\"https://whitepaper.io/document/596/polkadot-whitepaper\">https://whitepaper.io/document/596/polkadot-whitepaper</a></p>\n\n<h2>Tezos</h2>\n\n<p>Tezos has an acceptable profitability and moderate ease of staking. There are is an initial lock up period where you have to commit your assets to be confirmed by the network but then you are free to use them and get pay outs very regularly. They are a liquid network so you will have to vote for Staking providers. </p>\n\n<p>Tezos uses a variation of a Proof-of-Stake system that differs slightly from established models in that block producers are not selected by token holders and anyone can participate as a baker (validator) if they hold a specified amount of tokens. Token holders that do not meet the minimum threshold can delegate their tokens to a baker without needing to relinquish control of their tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://tezos.com/\">https://tezos.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Reddit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/</a></p>\n\n<p>How to stake (3rd party only):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://baking-bad.org/docs/tezos-staking-for-beginners/\">https://baking-bad.org/docs/tezos-staking-for-beginners/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.exodus.com/article/1300-tezos-staking-faq\">https://support.exodus.com/article/1300-tezos-staking-faq</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/tezos-staking\">https://atomicwallet.io/tezos-staking</a></p>\n\n<p>Tech: <a href=\"https://tezos.com/static/white_paper-2dc8c02267a8fb86bd67a108199441bf.pdf\">https://tezos.com/static/white_paper-2dc8c02267a8fb86bd67a108199441bf.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tezos.com/static/position_paper-841a0a56b573afb28da16f6650152fb4.pdf\">https://tezos.com/static/position_paper-841a0a56b573afb28da16f6650152fb4.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Upcoming tech: <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/tezos/profile\">https://messari.io/asset/tezos/profile</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>5.
