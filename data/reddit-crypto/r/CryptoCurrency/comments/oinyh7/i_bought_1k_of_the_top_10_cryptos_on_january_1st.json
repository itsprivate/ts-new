This is the monthly report for my homemade 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund. This group contains <strong>BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, XLM, USDT, LTC, BSV</strong>, and <strong>Tron.</strong></p>\n\n<p>---&gt; <strong>MOON DROP!</strong> What do you like to do with your free from <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> Moons? I like to give some away, even if penalized: <em>45 Moons to the first person to name the artist and title of the hidden song in this post AND share your favorite crypto of the moment.</em></p>\n\n<p>Why 45? It&#39;s my way to try to encourage <strong>Special Membership:</strong> right this second, MOONS ARE MOONING, $0.11! 45 are worth about $5 (45*.11), enough to treat yourself and the community to a month of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> special membership!

Close behind, <strong>Stellar</strong> is the second worst performer of June, down -37%.</p>\n\n<h2>Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers</h2>\n\n<p>Which crypto holds the most wins or losses over the life of the project?  Here’s a snapshot of the winners and losers over the first thirty months of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7ly6htf33ra71.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74386d5ddab306e66fd4690ec82ba97febed7782\"> 2019 Top Ten Ws and Ls - first monthly loss for EOS</a></p>\n\n<p>By a large margin, <strong>Tether</strong> still has the greatest number of monthly victories (9) followed by <strong>BTC</strong> with five. In other words, 30% of the time (nine times out of thirty months) every crypto in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio has finished the month in the red. </p>\n\n<p>Every crypto has won at least one month since January 2019.  After thirty months, <strong>EOS</strong> notched its first monthly loss in June.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Update –  ETH still way ahead, all cryptos in positive territory, EOS worst performing</h2>\n\n<p>Have a time machine?  Go back to the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/\">start of the 2019 Experiment</a> and pick yourself up some <strong>Ethereum.  ETH</strong> is easily the best performer of this group and has nearly doubled the return of <strong>BTC</strong> (1,438% vs 784%) as of this report.</p>\n\n<p>The $100 investment into first place <strong>ETH</strong> on <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/\">January 1st, 2019</a> is currently worth $1,579. Not bad.</p>\n\n<p>After thirty months, 100% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. Not counting stablecoin <strong>Tether</strong>, the worst performing crypto is <strong>EOS</strong>, which is still up +55%.   </p>\n\n<p>Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up an impressive +341%, it is still second place behind the best performing of the four Experiments: the 2020 Top Ten is up  +469%.</p>\n\n<h2>Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q7131tj73ra71.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e3061666cd2e1a364430199b97d11b904b822f7\"> Total Market cap +982&#37; since Jan 2019 </a></p>\n\n<p>The entire cryptocurrency sector is up +982% since <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/\">January 2019</a>.  That’s still well behind first place <strong>ETH</strong> (+1,438%) but much better than the rest of the cryptos (including second place <strong>Bitcoin’s</strong> +784%) and much, much better than the Top Ten approach.</p>\n\n<p>After reaching <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28\">$2T a few months ago</a>, the total market cap lost $265 billion in June. In terms of crypto market cap value, we’re back near where we were in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-26\">February</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Bitcoin Dominance:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ufhwdjbb3ra71.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2578c74ea486abeacda38e2138983e44356ccf12\"> A bounce in BitDom in June</a></p>\n\n<p>A bounce in June helped lift the <strong>BitDom</strong> from <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-29\">last month’s</a> 2019 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment record low.  For context, the table above shows the progression over the last thirty months with <strong>BTC</strong> domination ranging between 42% last month to a 70% high way back in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/\">August of 2019</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re curious as to what happened last time <strong>Bitcoin Dominance</strong> fell into the low 40s and 30s, check out the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-42\">2018 Top Ten Experiment</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/smlnkwne3ra71.png?width=322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35011c2235e822807ba920c3c6bb1a589587ee54\"> 2019 Top Ten Portfolio ROI </a></p>\n\n<p>The 2019 Top Ten Cryptos Portfolio lost $1,180 in June.  A big drop, but not quite as bad as the $1933 it lost in May.  After thirty months the value of the initial $1000 investment is <strong>$4,414</strong>, up +341%. The 2019 Portfolio is back to where it was in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-26\">February</a> 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table summarizing the monthly ROI over the life of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund experiment, which provides a pretty good sense of the journey to this point:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ccx0y0vg3ra71.png?width=565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1e0e54493e1490e198ff73ae4d8cd59a059be27\"> 2019 Top Ten ROI Summary </a></p>\n\n<p>Fairly steady upward movements punctuated by some very big dips.  During the <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15/\">Zombie Apocalypse</a>, for example, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio was returning only +6%. </p>\n\n<p>At +341%, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is the second best performing <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/\">out of the four Experiments</a>.  First place is the 2020 Top Ten group of cryptos, up +469% as of this report.  </p>\n\n<h2>Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put them all together now:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-42\">2018 Top Ten Experiment</a>: down -1% (total value $989)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-30\">2019 Top Ten Experiment</a>: up +341% (total value $4,414)</li>\n<li>2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +469% (total value $5,688)</li>\n<li>2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +184% (total value $2,840)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom <em>bottom</em> line: </p>\n\n<p><strong>After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,</strong> the combined portfolios are worth <strong>$13,931</strong> ($989 + $4,414 + $5,688 + $2,840).</p>\n\n<p><strong>That’s up +248%</strong> on the combined portfolio.  Two big monthly drops in a row: the combined portfolios are back to where they were in <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27\">February</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sp1vcx4r3ra71.jpg?width=380&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3840eaadbd017ce6261bc702540f195f3d8de0f\">https://preview.redd.it/sp1vcx4r3ra71.jpg?width=380&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3840eaadbd017ce6261bc702540f195f3d8de0f</a></p>\n\n<p>In summary: <strong><em>That’s an +248% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Top Ten Index vs. Top Five Index</h2>\n\n<p>Inspired by a suggestion from one of our blog readers, let’s take a look at how the 2019 Top Ten approach would compare to a hypothetical Top Five Index.</p>\n\n<p>A Top Five 2019 Index would mean investing $200 into <strong>BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH,</strong> and <strong>EOS.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p8at6r6t3ra71.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41ae4fe66e0d3587f6f4bbf8d4e9ead3787318be\"> Much better ROI by sticking to the Top Five</a></p>\n\n<p>After thirty months, a Top Five Index would be worth <strong>$6,260</strong>, returning <strong>526%</strong>. That’s compared to the <strong>$4,414</strong> (<strong>+341%)</strong> returns of the 2019 Top Ten.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, it is very clear that going with the five largest caps on January 1st, 2019 would have been the much better approach.</p>\n\n<p>Alright, that’s crypto.  How does crypto compare to the stock market?</p>\n\n<h2>Comparison to S&amp;P 500:</h2>\n\n<p>I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.  A solid month for the stock market and yet another all time high for the S&amp;P:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ps3m3r804ra71.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9269b28de62189a7feed1db71732b2b1855dee58\"> Month S&amp;P levels since Jan. 2019 </a></p>\n\n<p>Because the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 71% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto 2.5 years ago would be worth $1,720 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 in January 2019. </p>\n\n<p>Even though an extremely solid return for traditional markets, that +72% return is nearly <em>two hundred and seventy percentage points behind</em> the return of the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio over the same time period.</p>\n\n<p>But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&amp;P 500? It would yield the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1620 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1720 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1340 today</li>\n<li>$1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1150 today</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom <em>bottom</em> line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: </p>\n\n<p><strong>After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,830</strong> ($1,620 + $1,720 + $1,340 + $1,150)</p>\n\n<p>That is up <strong>+46%</strong> <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/\">since January 2018</a> compared to a <strong>+248%</strong> gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of over 200 percentage points <strong><em>in favor of crypto.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Here’s a table providing an overview of the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ctsh4a634ra71.jpg?width=501&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61be4d45f0944035da56c1aa28899f572e925e84\"> Crypto vs. S&amp;P: crypto still with a healthy lead</a></p>\n\n<p>That’s a nine month streak and a 202% lead for crypto, about the same as a few months ago in February.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n<p>Two straight red months, where do we go from here?  Are the crypto bears or the crypto bulls right?  No one knows: anyone who says they do is selling you something.  Hopefully these numbers help provide a bit of perspective as you, dear reader, are trying to make an informed decision. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTGJfRPLe08\">Gosh</a>, crypto can be nuts: if you do decide to jump in, buckle up and enjoy the ride.  </p>\n\n<p>To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate this strange and exciting crypto landscape. </p>\n\n<p>Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects tracking the Top Ten cryptos as of <a href=\"https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41\">January 1st, 2018</a> (the OG experiment), January 1st, 2020, and most recently, January 1st, 2021.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
