What I&#39;m about to &quot;reveal&quot; has probably been discussed 1000&#39;s of times on here, but maybe not condensed into a single post. The only caveat to what I&#39;m about to write is that it only works in a bull market, which - lucky you - we&#39;re in the middle of. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also aware that the below goes against the &#39;hodl&#39; and &#39;diamond hands&#39; memes. Before you you hit that downvote arrow, there are many schools of thought in trading, this is just one. </p>\n\n<p>Also, of the 4 coins I&#39;m mentioning specifically, I only own one (Holo), so this isn&#39;t me trying to shill you my portfolio. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Intro:</strong> I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts here in the past about people not making money. People, making money right now is ridiculously easy. Read on for the simple 3 step plan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Find a coin in the top 100 that hasn&#39;t pumped in a while</strong></p>\n\n<p>All coins go through the same cycle: pump, correction, accumulation, pump. At least that&#39;s true for established coins which is why we&#39;re sticking to the top 100. If you think there&#39;s not enough profit in the top 100, take a look at what Matic just did (plenty of other examples like One, Solana, Fantom, XRP, etc.). The cycle can take weeks or months to repeat.</p>\n\n<p>What you need to do is <strong>not</strong> buy the pump. I know, hard to resist, but the problem is that you&#39;re probably going to end buying the top, or close to it. And as I wrote above, after the top comes the correction, which means price goes down. We also don&#39;t want to buy when the price is still going down, <strong>we want to buy at the point where a trend reversal is likely</strong>. On a daily chart, what you&#39;re looking for is sharp peak on the left, followed by descending (red) candles on the right, eventually evening out as the area of support is found (that&#39;s your entry). </p>\n\n<p>Two perfect examples from the last two days of the above would be Fantom and Holo. They pumped weeks ago, have since dropped significantly in price and pulled a very nice reversal in the past two days  (had you bought Fantom&#39;s Sunday dip, you&#39;d be up almost 50% now, almost 40% for Holo). If you&#39;re wondering, KSM might be one to watch out for here in the near future (not financial advice). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> probably preferable to buying into a position all at once would be <strong>daily cost averaging</strong>. This guide is already too long, so just google DCA, plenty of good youtube videos explaining the process. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Hodl</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m intentionally not including any tips on how to find good entries with TA (technical analysis) since this is obviously geared towards beginners. <strong>Thus, the chances of you timing this perfectly are slim, and you&#39;re probably going to have to wait a few days or even weeks for anything to happen.</strong> Throughout the hold period, the price will fluctuate and may even drop further. But here&#39;s the thing in a bull market: all top 100 coins will pump, it&#39;s a matter of when, not if (liquidity flows from coins that just pumped into coins that haven&#39;t and once enough volume is built, price breaks out into price discovery, ie the pump). If a coin with extremely flawed fundamentals like Tron can pump into the top 20, so can anything else in the top 100. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Realistic profit targets</strong></p>\n\n<p>You could of course just hodl the same coins throughout the bull market. <strong>If you picked good ones, you&#39;d probably be better off doing this actually.</strong> However, I&#39;m aware that we&#39;re all ADD affected  male apes in our primes, so you don&#39;t want to be in just a few coins, you want try a lot of coins. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s use Fantom as an example. Let&#39;s say you paid attention on Sunday and bought the dip at $0.35 (you were a little late, but still a decent entry). Realistic profit targets depend on your own level of risk aversion, suffice to say, 200% or even 100% aren&#39;t realistic profit targets. It&#39;s most likely going to take more than one pump to get there, which means potentially months of hodling Let&#39;s use something like 25%, 30% and 40% as an example (and no, these numbers aren&#39;t set in stone, they are just an example. Like I said, your targets will depend in your own risk tolerance). These would be set up in a series of sell orders:</p>\n\n<p>Sell order 1 (50% of your bag): $0.437</p>\n\n<p>Sell order 2 (30% of your bag): $0.455</p>\n\n<p>Sell order 3 (20% of your bag): $0.490</p>\n\n<p>Sell order 1 is the most likely scenario to hit, so you&#39;ll be selling half your bag here. If the coin keeps pumping, you&#39;ll sell another 30% at +30% price movement and you&#39;ll leave 20% for a &#39;moonshot&#39; +40% price increase. Watch the charts closely while your coin is pumping: <strong>if it starts to look like you&#39;re not going to hit your upper targets, you can sell on the way down, still making profit.</strong> Keep in mind too that pumps can last for days. It&#39;s up to you and only you to identify the pattern and then stick to your belief. <strong>As a general rule though, don&#39;t be greedy: any profit is still better than no profit.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>That&#39;s literally it.</strong> At this stage, you&#39;ll have turned your initial investment of $100 into $130. If that doesn&#39;t sound &#39;moonish&#39; enough for you, please show me another investment in which you can make 30% profit in a matter of days or 1 or 2 weeks. It doesn&#39;t exist outside of a crypto bullmarket. At this stage, you just repeat the process. Yes, it&#39;s a grind, but this is going to take work and that shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I think the reason why so many beginners end up losing money is because:</p>\n\n<p>- They buy into pumps when they should be buying lows</p>\n\n<p>- They overtrade, meaning they jump from coin to coin way too frequently and without any sort of strategy</p>\n\n<p>- They use leverage (if you&#39;re on twitter, asking your favourite influencer for entries, sell targets, stop losses, or how much leverage to use, you&#39;re not anywhere close to being ready for leverage)</p>\n\n<p>- They buy scam coins in the top 2000 thinking that&#39;s their path to Lambo Valhalla </p>\n\n<p>The guide I wrote works, and in terms of difficulty, it&#39;s probably 1 or 2 steps above just hodling a coin for the entirety of the bullrun. <strong>The one thing you need to do is take emotion out of the equation.</strong> When you&#39;re seeing a coin pump and you get that FOMO feeling, yep, that&#39;s 100% emotion. Realize there are hundreds of legitimate projects in crypto, and on any given day, some of those will be mooning. You can&#39;t be in every coin, and neither can anyone else. <strong>Be happy for other people&#39;s gains and practice patience waiting for yours, because it&#39;s a matter of when, not if.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
