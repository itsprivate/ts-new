So I looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past 10 years, BTC had (at least) 8 consecutive green days in a row only 16 times, most of them in the very early days. 7 of those were in 2012, 2 in 2013, 2 in 2015, and once each each year from 2016 to 2021, except 2018. The longest streak ever was in 2012 (15 days), after 2012 the longest streak was 10 days (happened twice, once in 2013 and once only last year, in July 2021).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means that BTC only needs two more green candles to tie the record for after 2012 - and one more to break it. As I am writing this, the daily candle is slightly green again, but it&amp;#39;s very close. Let&amp;#39;s hope for green days all week, let&amp;#39;s make this the longest streak in 10 years!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
