He just transferred 10 USDC, 3.98 AAVE ($200), 138 SUSHI, 0.1 YFI, 2.5 COMP ($75) and other actual &amp;quot;dust&amp;quot; to various centralised exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y3s8tqe5h6691.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2542551a5dedbadce3e75bfbc250aacefed50967\"&gt;His size is no longer size.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How a 20 BN fund imploded in a matter of days is a lesson for everyone who thinks they are too big to fail. Arrogance has no place in markets, often those with an arrogant streak are quickly shown their place by the markets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many more such people in crypto who thought they are too big and nothing could happen to them. Their behaviours smack of arrogance and disrespect for others. All it takes is one mistake where their ego takes over, and results in blowing up of all their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
