  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, as soon as Bitcoin started to see greens, one of the coins that started to pump hard is MATIC. I mentioned this in my previous post, and I was very confident of this as well as bullish. It has had a 16% gain yesterday and will continue to go.\nThis is thanks to the many announcements Polygon had in recent weeks. Here are some of these:\n- NFL announced that they are looking to issue tickets to it&amp;#39;s sporting events as NFTs on Polygon, these will be available for select games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unstoppable Domains (like ENS which provides human readable wallet addresses) announced that it would be leveraging Polygon for it&amp;#39;s blockchain domains, also meaning there won&amp;#39;t be massive minting fees like ENS which uses Ethereum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polygon announced their new maiden scaling solution which uses roll-ups and zero knowledge proofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And still it didn&amp;#39;t pump these days, here&amp;#39;s why:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polygon announced to invest $1 Billion in their zero-knowledge based technologies field in August. And most of the money is coming from selling MATIC token by the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matic has had a vesting cliff in october, in which many might have sold the gains to take profits, which was pretty much good as the coin was launched at cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally we had a bearish trend for the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in my opinion I&amp;#39;m sure, this is just the beginning and we would see it breaking it&amp;#39;s ATH anytime soon and reaching top 10. And cheers to my fellow MAThematICians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a tip finally:\nUsing Unstoppable domains might give you a chance of an airdrop. As there have been rumours about it. So DYOR and do accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
