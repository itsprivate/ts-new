Now the price of Luna goes down. The fact that the price is going down and total coins minted is rising encourages the selling of Luna making the price drop farther. If the price drops too far, it can no longer support the burning of UST to get a dollar by selling Luna.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The response from Reddit was - well yah that&amp;#39;s supply/demand + Terra is a lot more than UST there is a whole ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally Terra began buying BTC reserves and had over $1B in reserves to prepare for this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point the question isn&amp;#39;t will the peg break? The BTC reserves of $1B are likely all gone and nothing is probably left. Nearly 3B in volume in the last 24 hours. The question is, is this the end of Terra?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
