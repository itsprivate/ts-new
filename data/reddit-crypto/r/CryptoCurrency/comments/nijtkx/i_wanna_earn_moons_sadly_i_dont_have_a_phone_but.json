  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi. I&#39;m a poor person who lives in the Philippines which is an underdeveloped  country. To earn extra money, I join online sites. Recently, I found out that I could earn moons in this forum. Sadly, there&#39;s no vault in my reddit app. I found out that it&#39;s because I&#39;m using a tablet and the vault is only available in the smartphone app.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Someone said that s/he opened the vault in a tablet. This means that vault isn&#39;t supported only in old devices like mine. My Samsung Tab A device was released in March 2016. The vault and user&#39;s number of moons are both hidden.</p>\n\n<p>CONTINUATION:</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t have a smartphone because I gave it to my sister whose phone got damaged in 2018. Since then, I only have a tablet which also functions as my phone. It might sound weird for others because I&#39;m using it as a phone. But it&#39;s only small so no problem to even bring it outside. It&#39;s a 7 inch Samsung Tab A 2016 worth $160 which I&#39;ve been using for 3 years. Because my priority is paying expenses, I&#39;ve been stopping myself from buying a new phone for 3 years. After all, it&#39;s not really essential because my tablet is still fine.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I can&#39;t afford to buy a phone because there are other things which I need to prioritize first. Also, I don&#39;t get paid $150 from my previous earning site so I don&#39;t have additional money. </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, I found a way to use the vault and earn moons. I asked a family member to let me activate the vault and borrow her phone sometimes so I can post here. For example, I made this post on her phone.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, I&#39;m curious. After activating the vault on the device which I borrowed, is it still possible to earn moon if I post contents in my own device without vault support? If this would work, I don&#39;t need to borrow phone except during cash out and also I could avoid buying a new phone to save money.</p>\n\n<p>I hope my solution works. What do you think? Would it work? Thanks for reading this post. Also, I appreciate your opinion. Good day and night.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>To the 17% downvoters:  It&#39;s okay. ☺️</p>\n\n<p>To the 83% upvoters: </p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot for your upvote. ☺️ There&#39;s a lot of good people here especially in the comment section. They&#39;re really kind. Thanks for being a good person.👏👏 Also, thanks to the 4 people who gave me moons.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
