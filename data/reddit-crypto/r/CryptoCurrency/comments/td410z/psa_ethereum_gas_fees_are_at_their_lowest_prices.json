The only positive is that this means ETH gas fees are now affordable again with transfers between wallets costing &lt;strong&gt;~$1&lt;/strong&gt; and more complex interactions like uniswap token swaps and opensea sales costing &lt;strong&gt;~$10&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any dead tokens you want to get rid of or you want to transfer your ETH to an exchange or another wallet now is the perfect time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
