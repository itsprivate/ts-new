Since March 11, Ether has climbed by roughly 24%, while Bitcoin has increased by about 16%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The enthusiasm around a planned software upgrade that promises to minimize the blockchain&amp;#39;s carbon footprint while also improving the network&amp;#39;s scalability and efficiency is driving the Ether gains. The next significant, ambitious milestone for the Ethereum network is expected to attract millions of additional users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the merge, which is Ethereum&amp;#39;s transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain, has been greatly anticipated and may be the network&amp;#39;s most significant development since its founding in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the price of ETH will skyrocket since all transactions formerly carried out with USDT BEAN and other stablecoins, as well as other cryptocurrencies, can and will be carried out on the ETH network. Definitely the next big thing in the crypto realm, and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
