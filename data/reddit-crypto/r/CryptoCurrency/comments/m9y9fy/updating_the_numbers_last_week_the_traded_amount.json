Also AirTM is used as exchange too. There are other exchanges (Even local ones like Cryptia and AmberesCoin). I don&#39;t have a way of measure the daily/weekly/monthly trade there so that is why I use LocalBitcoin as reference.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who trades BTC to Bolivares? People that needs to pay in some places where  crypto is not accepted. Where do these BTC come from? Could be miners,  could be people abroad that send money to their families in Venezuela, could be the goverment itself (sadly), people with crypto savings, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who  trades Bolivares to BTC? People that gets insane amounts of Bolivares  (like store owners), people that get paid in Bolivares, and want to  convert them in something better and stable than Bolivares digitally and  easy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A  big chunk of the population that works for the goverment (around 3 millions) have a monthly  wage of around 1-10 monthly minium wages, monthly minimum wage is  around 1 USD (recently increased). So that would put that people from 1 to 10 USD  monthly. There is also a food bonus that is the same than the wage.</p>\n\n<p>But the &quot;average&quot; wage is around (in some research) is around 60-80 USD.</p>\n\n<p>According  to a NGO (CENDAS) a 5 members family need around 350 USD monthly to  &quot;live&quot;, yes if you are from USA, Canada, Australia, Germany that amount  is ridiculous low, but that is a standar in Latin America, problem more  that what you need to spend are the WAGES, they are crazy low. A really  good wage here is around 400 USD monthly (in my opinion).</p>\n\n<p>And MOONS for me, wow, have helped me a lot (Sadly I have to cash out usually). What a great idea!</p>\n\n<p>One monthly minimum wage is around:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3250 satoshis</li>\n<li>17 MOONS</li>\n<li>2 XRP</li>\n<li>19 DOGE</li>\n<li>0.2 NANO</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Even when MOONS are nice and have helped me a lot, I don&#39;t post these updates for that (Moon-farming) I have been doing that for years a long time ago before MOONS where a thing.</p>\n\n<p>Sources (PLEASE  check them!!!):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usefultulips.org/combined_VES_Page.html\">https://www.usefultulips.org/combined_VES_Page.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/\">https://www.caracaschronicles.com/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/VES/BTC\">https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/VES/BTC</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/ves/\">https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/ves/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-economy/venezuela-to-introduce-1-million-bolivar-bill-as-inflation-persists-idUSL2N2L401H\">https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-economy/venezuela-to-introduce-1-million-bolivar-bill-as-inflation-persists-idUSL2N2L401H</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2020/10/23/you-need-285-minimum-wages-in-venezuela-to-feed-your-family/\">https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2020/10/23/you-need-285-minimum-wages-in-venezuela-to-feed-your-family/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
