These are designed by the lead organizers first making the followers part of the pump (after the organizers have bought some good amount in advance) and then with their network effect on Twitter etc. they try to capture newbies and immediately dump it on them (and most of the followers that cause the spike too). Sometimes it takes seconds right after the start of the pump with the organizers not waiting for others to join (probably depending on how the price is dropping at that point) and just drop it on just the followers who spiked the price 10 seconds ago. It&#39;s a huge scam trend (occurring much more frequent than before) and we must really spread this around!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
