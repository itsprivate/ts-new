Crypto caught my attention in late 2017, mainly due to constantly seeing bitcoin memes on reddit (You know that gif with the coin on the vertical rollercoaster) well that was posted non-stop as bitcoin hit higher highs everyday on the way to $20,000. By the time I finished doing some research and carefully selecting my buys, I happened to sell my car. I decided to invest 25% of it into crypto on Jan 8th 2018. Lol you heard that right, Jan 2018, the entire market crashed and my alts bleed 80% plus, they continued to bleed until I lost about 85% and I stayed red for nearly two years. Instead of selling and exiting, I decided that with the halving every four years I was this time in early for the 20/21. I held, dca’d and saw this sub turn to a ghost town (only recently got my own account to get some moons) but eventually the next cycle came. Time in the market always beats trying to time it, so get ready to say you were early for the 23/24 cycle ATHs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
