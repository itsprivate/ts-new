  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Currently, karma is counted towards the monthly moons distribution even if the moderators remove content from which the karma is earned. The reason for this stems back to when the community use to have an event called Weekend Memes. The intention was to count karma even though all meme posts were removed on Sunday at midnight when Weekend Memes ended. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Since Weekend Memes was discontinued several months ago, this concern is no longer valid today.  It makes logical sense to only award moons to content which does not break the rules. <strong>If the act of breaking the rules means being rewarded, then why have rules in the first place?</strong> The consequences need to be consistent. We don&#39;t want upvote parties or brigades to be further incentivized. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>In this poll, I propose not awarding moons to removed content, whether it is a submission or a comment. If a submission is removed, <strong>comments in the corresponding comment section will still qualify for moon rewards.</strong> However, comments which break our rules in these particular comment sections will still be disqualified from moon rewards. Also to clear up any potential confusion, deleted content will not be affected. If you delete a submission or a comment of yours, the karma from this content will still be counted towards the next moon distribution. In Reddit language, content removal is performed by a mod or admin and content deletion is done by the original author.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As a reminder, this poll has been submitted twice already. Here are links to the <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nb25pk/dont_award_karma_for_moon_purposes_to_removed/\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o4z3aw/disqualify_removed_content_from_earning_moon/\">second</a> attempts. The first poll had 2.2 thousand votes and 7.2 million moons with 68.7% in favor and 31.3% against. The following poll had a much better vote to moon ratio with 7.4 thousand votes and 7 million moons with 74% in favor and 26% against. They did not pass since the moon decision thresholds were never reached, even though the voting majorities were in favor. Since the moon thresholds for the prior polls were never reached, the proposal technically did not fail. It just is not settled yet. In order for the proposal to be truly settled so we can declare it has passed or failed, <strong>we need a majority voting in favor or against it with the moon decision threshold reached</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/oy8aks\">View Poll</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
