You can earn more than 10% interest on holding some stablecoin, or you hold any other Crypto, like Ethereum, which has outperformed even the highest rallying traditional markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If banks really want to be in control of our money, they better be ready to pay for it, or we move our money to Crypto (or literally anywhere else). This basically a scam on older people who are not aware where to store their money elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
