It really does appear that after a decade Bitcoin has finally died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this was a great journey friends but we should probably sell any remaining crypto we have and put that money into a savings account with a high interest rate of 0.001%, we should be able to retire with it after another 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;good luck to you all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
