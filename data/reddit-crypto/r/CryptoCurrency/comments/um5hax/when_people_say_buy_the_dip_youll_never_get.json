The crypto market crashed and people were saying buy as much as you can now, because BTC is going to $100k by the end of the year. Now fast forward one year..... Many of the big crypto are at or lower than the prices they were a year ago, we never hit $100k BTC, and people are back to the same old &amp;quot;Buy now or you&amp;#39;ll regret it later&amp;quot; posts. In short, nobody here actually knows what they&amp;#39;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People telling you to buy now or you&amp;#39;ll regret it later are essentially just telling you to FOMO in. 100% of the people saying it have likely just FOMOed in themselves, and now want you to FOMO in as well to increase their investment. Don&amp;#39;t listen to people here. Stick to your own investment plan and ignore the calls to FOMO in now from strangers on Reddit. Prices may very well go back up quickly and you missed your chance to buy cheap crypto, but they could just as well keep falling below the next support and you&amp;#39;ve just FOMOed into comparatively expensive crypto. Have your own investment plan and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; The people here don&amp;#39;t know anything. They just pretend they do. Have your own investment plan and stick to it. Ignore the people telling you to FOMO in on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
