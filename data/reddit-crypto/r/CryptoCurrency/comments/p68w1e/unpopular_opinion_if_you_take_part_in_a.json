You are subjected to a ton of downvotes. </p>\n\n<p>But we have shitposts that make it to the thousands of upvotes. Literally bringing nothing to the table cause most of the time they aren&#39;t even real stories. Just formulated to get upvotes, which is fine, but don&#39;t shut down other posts on this forum, because you feel it&#39;s not worthy of you&#39;re time. If it&#39;s not, just move on. </p>\n\n<p>But instead of moving on, you can see every comment in the post gets downvoted, multiple times. This isn&#39;t good for the sub, it causes people to delete their comments on posts so they don&#39;t get downvoted to oblivion. Which ultimately takes people away from wanting to be active on this sub. Are people just that ignorant and wanting to moon hoard so much til it kills this sub? </p>\n\n<p>Unless they are completely senseless and don&#39;t give a means to open up a dialog for conversation on things related to the crypto world. Then I can understand downvoting. </p>\n\n<p>I hope as a community we could overcome this before it drives a lot of new comers away. The reason this sub was great was because you could come here and have an opinion,  great conversations, get updates in news, and shitpost. Shitposting isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s the coordinated downvote attacks. All while doing so, get a little slice of pie and some income. This is what made this sub great, now it&#39;s seems to be slipping away.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Popular or unpopular opinion, is based of an individuals experience within a sub. I thought that would be obvious. If you&#39;re here to say this is a Popular Opinion, then you&#39;re missing the entire point of this post. It&#39;s to raise awareness to this issue. Unfortunately it can be a two way street by raising awareness to this subject. Causing people to join this groups, but I ultimately don&#39;t think many people would do this after knowing they exist. If so, well I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much more to be said than you&#39;re a shitlord.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
