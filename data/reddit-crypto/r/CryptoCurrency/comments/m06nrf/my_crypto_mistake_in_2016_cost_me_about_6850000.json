I tried mining it but didn&#39;t succeed. (Nowadays I&#39;m mining $2k a month and I&#39;m building a solar powered bitcoin mining farm. I know, just like vosk.)</p>\n\n<p>ANYWAYS</p>\n\n<p>I bought an ethereum mining contract for $300 when Ethereum was at $0.07.</p>\n\n<p>I got basically nothing in return, and had I just bought instead, I would have 4,285 ETH. Or about $6.9 million dollars.</p>\n\n<p>it messes with me every day, but I learned my lesson. After working for the largest bitcoin exchange in the world for over a year, I only grew even more in love with blockchain. it keeps me up at night. I catch myself day dreaming of the possibilities and applications, and how things will develop geopolitically, philosophically, and of course, technologically. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: When I said &#39;it messes with me every day&#39; I don&#39;t mean I&#39;m suffering. I&#39;m doing great and its probably the best thing that ever happened to me, as it lead to me to learn more and eventually get a job working at a crypto exchange. Yeah it sucks but that&#39;s life, can only keep your head up and keep going.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: To all the people saying that i would have sold at 20, 30, or 100k: i bought and held btc before that and still have not sold. i have about 10 altcoins that i hold and earn interest on through DeFi. So knowing myself, its highly unlikely. I even went and sold some of my btc and bought more eth so i ended up having several eth, but not thousands.</p>\n\n<p>3: a lot of people dming me asking about my work stuff. id love to chat with all yall but its too much. i have a youtube <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=YhOicihaeUk&amp;feature=share\">channel</a> where I talk about stuff related to this if you are curious;. thanks and take care</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
