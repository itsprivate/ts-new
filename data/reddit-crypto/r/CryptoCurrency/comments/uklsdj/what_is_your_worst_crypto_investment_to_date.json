I cut a few at the beginning of the year to buy some BTC, which turned out to be a decent idea considering how much more most alts have bled in comparison, but realistically cash and gradual buys would have been the better option. I didn’t anticipate a crash like this, maybe that was naive, but here we are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, was just wondering what has been the worst for people here. Maybe we got caught up in the same projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
