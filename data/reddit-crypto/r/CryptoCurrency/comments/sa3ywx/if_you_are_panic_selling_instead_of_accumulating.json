It’s pretty simple: buy low, sell high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve been around the block a few times and let me tell you that the LAST thing you want to be is the last seller in a crash. Those people are the ones who give their money to the people who are investing correctly. I promise you, there will be a better opportunity than today for you to sell in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you sold last week, congrats, buy back in now to lock in a nice gain in coins. The bottom is too hard to time, and it’ll probably happen in the middle of the night and get away from you before you have a chance. Then you’ll be waiting for it to come back down, then it’ll go above your sell price, and you’ll lose coins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t sold yet or you don’t have any extra cash to accumulate, you’re holding on for dear life. There will be better days, do not let emotion make you lose focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
