We did so initially. And it was the plan. But you know, things happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we have heard you guys out. You guys want to know WHAT our tokens are backed by. You DON&amp;#39;T want it backed by &amp;quot;commercial paper&amp;quot; and other fun things. We will do an &amp;quot;actual&amp;quot; audit soon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why we shall just swap all 70 billion USDT with DAI, which IS backed by US dollars. Doing some simple math,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USDT = DAI = USD&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USDT = USD&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask me anything&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
