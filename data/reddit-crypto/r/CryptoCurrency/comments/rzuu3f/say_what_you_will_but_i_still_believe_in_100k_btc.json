They all went upwards. Now maybe if they only went up a little then I could see why people would be sceptical but no, they were right up there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what about all those influencers and celebrities and rich people. They promised me that they know this is a fact and people never lie, especially not for something so important like money!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also everyone said BTC was a guaranteed hedge against inflation and inflation is like 40% in Turkey right now so BTC must go up by at least 100%, that&amp;#39;s just super obvious to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I stand by BTC and I stand by 100k 2021 and I invite you to join me. Ley nothing and no one stop us from achieving our dreams!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
