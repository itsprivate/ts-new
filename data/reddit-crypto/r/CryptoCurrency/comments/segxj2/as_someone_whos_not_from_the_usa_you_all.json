No. There are so many of us that don&amp;#39;t give an absolute donkey&amp;#39;s ass about why you think one party is better than the other. They are both awful and you&amp;#39;re kidding yourself if you think &lt;strong&gt;either&lt;/strong&gt; of them has you or your favourite crypto&amp;#39;s best interest in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By all means, it is important that many of these topics within the political sphere are discussed and opposed when they threaten the future of our financial independence, freedom of information, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, it gets old fast when you all inject your political views into things. If you&amp;#39;re going to constantly look for reasons to hate on a political party,  but not actually address the underlying REASONS both parties are equally corrupt when discussing crypto, you&amp;#39;re not helping the issue, you&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/rant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
