If you&#39;d have said those coins were going to crash 95% (which is what happened) you probably would have been downvoted to oblivion.</p>\n\n<p>I actually think we&#39;re still a long way from the peak of this current cycle, but obviously I don&#39;t have a clue anymore than anyone else does (who saw the March 2020 crash coming?) But if things continue as they are we&#39;re going to be seeing similar price predictions about all kinds of projects over these next few months, so just a friendly reminder to take what you read with a pinch of salt.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t be a crypto grandma and believe everything you read, and if you&#39;re going to yolo, make sure it&#39;s with money you&#39;re really ok with losing.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck out there and I hope you&#39;re enjoying this wild ride as much as I am!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
