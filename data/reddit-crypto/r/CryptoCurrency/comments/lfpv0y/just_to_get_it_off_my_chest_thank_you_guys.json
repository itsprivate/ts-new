I&#39;ve never been a tech-savy person but I feel like I really understand this stuff, which is a huge confidence boost that I needed. I&#39;m really excited to be part of a community, and get in on crypto while it&#39;s still early. Blockchain is amazing, I just got the book &quot;Blockchain Revolution&quot; to learn more. I feel like I just made an AOL.com account in 1990! I know I&#39;m not alone in being new to this, I&#39;ve noticed lots of newbies came over after the GME drama.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to all the people who have answered my questions (no one has been condescending or anything). I&#39;ve gleaned so much from lurking in the comments. Such a helpful community here. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m still wrapping my head around the Ethereum network and altcoins. Is it weird that I just wanna collect them all like they&#39;re Pokemon??? A lot of them are cheap enough to just throw a little money at even if I don&#39;t understand their use. They all have cute little logos - hell, one of them is a UNICORN!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it&#39;s brought me out of a rough, months-long depression, and I&#39;m pretty excited for the future again :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
