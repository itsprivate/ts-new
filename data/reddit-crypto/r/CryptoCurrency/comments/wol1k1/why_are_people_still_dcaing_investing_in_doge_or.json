I completely understood why people did it in previous cycles for bigger rewards when they pump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they both have been hitting top 10. Both had an insane run and their market cap is still high making them one of the highest in the entire crypto world. But why? What do people expect from Shiba and Doge next bullrun?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin, ETH and a lot of other top alts are on the same discount as them with the difference their value actually comes from the tech behind it. Memecoins value is more hype, fun and memes but I would rather put money into the next Memecoin then one that already peaked and will most likely only perform as good as “normal” cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Curious why people still buy those instead of the next big meme that can peak next bull run or other top alts with the same reward&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: btw SHIB is currently up +34% today and DOGE +9.4% &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So clearly there’s big money involved potentially as an investment for longer time which I try to understand&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
