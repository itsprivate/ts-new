  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pro-crypto for sure, but I see many people in here praising the El Salvador/Crypto &amp;quot;saga&amp;quot; and I don&amp;#39;t understand why? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week ago, the Credit Rating Agency &amp;quot;Moody&amp;quot; downgraded El Salvador&amp;#39;s sovereign bonds due to their irresponsible and crappy implementation of crypto. Do you know how president Nayib Bukele addressed the matter? By replying &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1483194959989719059\"&gt;BREAKING: EL SALVADOR DGAF&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Do you know who certainly &amp;quot;GAF&amp;quot;? The lenders that a country in a financial crisis like El Salvador heavily relies on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;El Salvador is now down over $20 million since investing in BTC. This amount might not be a lot from your perspective, but we&amp;#39;re talking about El Salvador for god&amp;#39;s sake. One-third of Salvadorans can&amp;#39;t afford food yet their &amp;quot;crypto bro&amp;quot; president is &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1467333081505976323\"&gt;day-trading&lt;/a&gt; Crypto on his phone with tax money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, I am not attacking crypto per se. I am addressing how bad the implementation is and how terrible the consequences can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was rushed and not discussed enough. There is no transparency at all and a lack of education on how bitcoin operates. A gov-run BTC wallet with so many reported hacking &amp;amp; vulnerabilities breaches along with a naïve &amp;quot;Mass adoption &amp;amp; promising projects&amp;quot; propaganda is not a good mix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a country filled with unrest, crime, and corruption, blind adoption is not a solution. Especially for developing countries facing many significant problems that put at risk the lives of their people. For many developing nations, the failure of El Salvador&amp;#39;s crypto vision will only confirm their doubts that adopting such technologies is ineffective. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mass adoption means nothing if the implementation is this crappy. Please stop glorifying a dictator who&amp;#39;s objectively harming his own people and will eventually harm other nations&amp;#39; perception of crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
