They usually get a new message saying they need to get verified again, but even after submitting the new documents they&#39;re still locked out.</p>\n\n<p>Customers are spending weeks trying to get any message back from customer support, often they only receive an automated message. The problem seems to be that accounts get flagged under &#39;&#39;risk control&#39;&#39;, a function that normally protects a customer from possible account breaches but it doesn&#39;t seem to work properly. If the account gets flagged Binance asks to get verified again, and here they&#39;re running into a wall of bad customer support.</p>\n\n<p>I would avoid using Binance US for a while, in times of volatility it&#39;s important you have the ability to move funds or withdraw funds whenever you want, without the risk of getting flagged. I haven&#39;t seen the same problems with the international version of Binance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
