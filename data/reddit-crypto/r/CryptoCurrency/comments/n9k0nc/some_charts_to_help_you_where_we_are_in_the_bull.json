This means the longer ETH can continue to trend higher to the next subsequent regression trendline, potentially the higher the market cycle top.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At a current price of $3,986, ETH currently resides between Band 5 ($5,280) and Band 6 ($2,832).</li>\n<li>Based on these regression lines, ETH&#39;s next big test of resistance is currently $5,280 while support resides around $2,832.</li>\n<li>A move up to Band 8, which coincides with ETH’s previous market cycle top, would imply a $16,020 Ether and a +301.8% return from current price.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s +1 Yr. HODL Wave</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wcr1dxtttdy61.png?width=3524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4b2ed9176e636d8bce40f85af922273f03dcc8e\">https://preview.redd.it/wcr1dxtttdy61.png?width=3524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4b2ed9176e636d8bce40f85af922273f03dcc8e</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s +1 Yr. HODL Wave shows what percentage of coins in circulation haven&#39;t been moved in at least 1 year.</li>\n<li>When charted against BTC&#39;s price, one can identify trends that coincide with bull and bear market cycles. </li>\n<li>Historically, a local top in the +1 Yr. HODL wave is congruent with the start of a new bull market. When the number of untouched coins begins to decline amid rapid price appreciation, one can be confident that a new bull market cycle is likely underway.</li>\n<li>When the downward slope of the HODL wave grows increasingly steeper, one can assume that selling pressure is beginning to increase and supply is likely to outpace demand. As such, a cycle top is presumably creeping closer.</li>\n<li>Prior to hitting a local high, a gradual increase in the +1 Yr. HODL wave signals that market participants are in &quot;accumulation mode.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current +1 Yr. HODL Wave reading sits at 54.78%, i.e. 54.78% of all coins in circulation haven&#39;t been moved in more than a year. This is down -8.6 percentage points from a local top of 63.4% set on September 9, 2020.</li>\n<li>On January 31, 2013, BTC&#39;s +1 Yr. HODL Wave hit a local high of 48.2% and the price of BTC was at $20.40. When BTC hit a cycle high of $1,158 on November 30, 2013, the +1 Yr. HODL Wave reading was at 38.8%. That is, over the course of 303 days, the number of coins that hadn&#39;t been moved in more than a year had fallen 9.4 percentage points while price appreciated +5,580%.</li>\n<li>On January 19, 2016, BTC&#39;s +1 Yr. HODL Wave hit a local high of 61.5% and the price of BTC was at $380. When BTC hit a cycle high of $19,660 on December 17, 2017, the HODL Wave reading was at 43.1%. That is, over the course of 698 days, BTC&#39;s HODL Wave fell -18.4 percentage points while price appreciated +5,073%.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s 200W Moving Avg.

The trendline measures the average price of BTC over the prior 200 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Moving Average Multiple:</strong> The multiple with which BTC is trading at relative to its 200-week moving average. For example, a multiple of 4.0x means BTC is trading at 4x its 200-week moving average.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In prior bull market cycles, BTC has traded as much as 10x - 15x its 200-week moving average prior to entering a bear market.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 200-week moving average is 4.47x. That is, BTC is trading at 4.47x its 200-week moving average ($12,467), down from last week&#39;s multiple of 4.78x.</li>\n<li>Given today&#39;s 200-week moving average of $12,467, a 10x - 15x multiple would imply a BTC price of $124,670 - $187,005.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 10.3X for the week of April 4, 2013. On April 9, 2013, BTC hit a cycle high of $259.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 13.2X for the week of November 25, 2013, which coincided with a market cycle top of $1,158.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 15.2X for the week of December 11, 2017.

A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term and a value of 50 means that the term is half as popular.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current Google trends score is 39, down from last month&#39;s reading of 50 and from a local high of 64 set in January 2021.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s Google trends score hit an all-time high of 100 in December 2017.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s Logarithmic Growth Curve</h3>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n2x1l6e3udy61.png?width=3394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57e42474b420f300384fe5d1686c47a7fc0268bc\">https://preview.redd.it/n2x1l6e3udy61.png?width=3394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57e42474b420f300384fe5d1686c47a7fc0268bc</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s logarithmic growth curve consists of two sets of curved trendlines that have historically proven to be critical levels of support and resistance.</li>\n<li>While both lines point to price ranges whereby BTC is arguably &quot;overbought&quot; or &quot;oversold,&quot; they also represent a notable underlying property of BTC that can be found in social networks, technological innovations, pandemics, societies, and economics: exponential growth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC is a +48% to +94% move away from entering into &quot;overbought&quot; territory, which is currently between $82,504 and $108,147.</li>\n<li>BTC is a -60% to -70% move away from falling into &quot;oversold&quot; territory. This week&#39;s range is $16,920 - $22,179.</li>\n<li>At a current price of $55,750, BTC resides in the 61 percentile of the logarithmic growth curve&#39;s $16,920 - $108,147 range.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Kraken Intelligence&#39;s Bitcoin Logarithmic Retracement Curve</h3>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uutb4op4udy61.png?width=3416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c24efde57a6e0df78a3dd24c442e5eb5f46f6b19\">https://preview.redd.it/uutb4op4udy61.png?width=3416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c24efde57a6e0df78a3dd24c442e5eb5f46f6b19</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s logarithmic retracement curve uses the growth curve&#39;s uptrending support line and historical price action to back into an implied market cycle top.</li>\n<li>Since 2011, BTC has long respected the growth curve&#39;s support line and has historically retraced down to said level upon hitting a market cycle top.</li>\n<li>When considering BTC&#39;s previous bull market cycles, one will find that it takes, on average, 385 days for BTC to retrace back down to the support band after hitting a top.</li>\n<li>Also, one will find that BTC has corrected, on average, -86% after the bull market ends. </li>\n<li>By knowing where the price of the support curve is 385 days from today and making assumptions about how severe BTC will correct after hitting a cycle top, one can have a better sense as to where BTC would need to be trading to correct down to the support band over a period of 385 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The price of BTC&#39;s logarithmic growth curve support 385 days from today is $34,783.</li>\n<li>Assuming BTC corrects -70% this market cycle, BTC would need to be trading at $115K for BTC to retrace down to support 385 days from today.</li>\n<li>An -86% correction implies a $252K cycle top and a -90% correction implies a $347K cycle top.</li>\n<li>According to this model, BTC is not currently in &quot;market cycle top&quot; territory.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s Monthly Upper Bollinger Band &amp; RSI</h3>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/40zev966udy61.png?width=3572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c6c3461cfea01d6b0c7d6a7be6eb79e70b00548\">https://preview.redd.it/40zev966udy61.png?width=3572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c6c3461cfea01d6b0c7d6a7be6eb79e70b00548</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bollinger Bands:</strong> A technical indicator that can be used to measure volatility and identify “overbought” or “oversold” conditions. When trading above the upper band, an asset can be considered &quot;overbought.&quot; If trading below, the asset is considered &quot;oversold.&quot; Oftentimes, the upper and lower Bollinger band represents a +/- 2 standard deviation move from a 20-period moving average. However, we&#39;ll be keeping an eye on a +4.5 standard deviation upper Bollinger band relative to BTC&#39;s 20-month moving average.</li>\n<li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> One of most popular and widely used momentum oscillators. It measures over a 14-period duration and fluctuates between 0 and 100. A reading below 30 indicates &quot;oversold,&quot; a reading over 70 signals &quot;overbought.&quot; Given its historical relevance, we&#39;ll be focusing on BTC&#39;s 14-month RSI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current intramonth high of $59,603 came $43,538 short of crossing its monthly upper Bollinger band of $103,141.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 14-month RSI is currently 87.9. The index may be in &quot;overbought&quot; territory, but history tells us that BTC can remain in &quot;overbought&quot; territory for an extended period of time. Note that BTC&#39;s 14-month RSI held in &quot;overbought&quot; territory between December 2016 and February 2018.</li>\n<li>In April 2013, November 2013, and December 2017, BTC hit an intramonth high above its monthly upper Bollinger band as price set a market cycle top. Only in these 3 instances have we seen BTC break through its +4.5 standard deviation monthly upper Bollinger band. BTC&#39;s 14-month RSI also topped out well into &quot;overbought&quot; territory at a reading of 96.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s MVRV Z-Score </h3>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z1v81xo7udy61.png?width=3558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a619ec31a90df8e641d098c933daff44d0ee8f4a\">https://preview.redd.it/z1v81xo7udy61.png?width=3558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a619ec31a90df8e641d098c933daff44d0ee8f4a</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What Is A Z-Score?</strong> A numerical measurement that can explain a value&#39;s relationship to a group&#39;s average. It is measured in terms of standard deviations. For example, a z-score of 0 means that a value is identical to the mean and a z-score of 1.0 means that a value is one standard deviation above the average.</li>\n<li><strong>BTC&#39;s MVRV Z-Score:</strong> Considers BTC&#39;s market value and realized value to help determine when BTC may be over/undervalued. A z-score between 7 and 11 (pink box) suggests BTC is &quot;overbought.&quot; When between 0.9 and -0.3 (green box), BTC is believed to be &quot;oversold.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>MVRV Z-Score Formula:</strong> (Market Value – Realized Value) / (Std. Deviation of Market Value).</li>\n<li><strong>Market Value:</strong> BTC&#39;s price multiplied by coins in circulation, i.e. market cap.</li>\n<li><strong>Realized Value:</strong> The price of each BTC when it was last moved. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current MVRV z-score is 4.38, down -1.6% from yesterday&#39;s reading of 4.45 and down -1.4% from last week&#39;s reading of 4.44.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s market value is down -0.9% at $1T and its realized value is up +0.2% at $374B.</li>\n<li>A +59.8% increase in BTC&#39;s z-score would put the indicator in &quot;overbought&quot; territory. A -79.5% correction would put the indictor in &quot;oversold&quot; territory.</li>\n<li>Prior z-score tops:\n\n<ul>\n<li>April 9, 2013: 11.05</li>\n<li>November 23, 2013: 10.8</li>\n<li>December 8, 2017: 9.77</li>\n<li>Average score: 10.54</li>\n<li>Note: These z-score readings topped out 1 day, 7 days, and 11 days, respectively, ahead of a market cycle top.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>On February 21, 2021, BTC&#39;s z-score hit a 3-year high of 7.62.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s Pi Indicator</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rkk2d009udy61.png?width=3390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=511ab9b845b232f28946636604629d8b8475c0c9\">https://preview.redd.it/rkk2d009udy61.png?width=3390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=511ab9b845b232f28946636604629d8b8475c0c9</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s Pi indicator leverages the 111-day moving average and the 350-day moving average multiplied by 2 to identify market cycle tops.</li>\n<li>Historically speaking, when the moving averages touch, a top in the current market cycle has been or will be realized.</li>\n<li>It should be noted that 350 / 111 equates to 3.153, which is as close to Pi (3.142) as we can get to when dividing 350 by a whole number.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As of today, BTC&#39;s 111-day moving average is $51,124 and its 350-day moving average x 2 is $52,726.</li>\n<li>On April 11, 2021, the Pi indicator crossed for the fourth time in history. Approximately 3 days later, BTC hit an all-time high of $65,000.</li>\n<li>On April 6, 2013, both moving averages crossed when BTC was trading at $229.

This reduction in new coins (flow) drives BTC&#39;s stock-to-flow ratio higher, implying that BTC is scarcer and thus more valuable. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin is 1084 days out from its next halving, at which point its block reward will fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current divergence is 0.59, down from yesterday&#39;s reading of 0.6 and down from last week&#39;s reading of 0.61.</li>\n<li>Prior market cycle tops coincided with a divergence reading of 40.8 (June 2011), 9.8 (April 2013), 9.75 (December 2013), and 3.5 (December 2017).</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
