You ain&amp;#39;t alone&lt;/strong&gt; - Jack joined Safemoon in April as their Chief Operations Officer and was often seen alongside the CEO, spinning a vast web of bullshit while the devoted&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; threw in tens of thousands of dollars while Safemoon&amp;#39;s market valuation performed a triple-salchow off the 10m diving board straight down to the gutter of the all-time-lows where it&amp;#39;s currently been wallowing like a sickly pig.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to what Jack &lt;em&gt;actually did&lt;/em&gt;, well that&amp;#39;s more difficult. I&amp;#39;d like to think he was there to produce an air of legitimacy to the project but even that&amp;#39;s a bit of a stretch, considering his previous employment had him working as a... &lt;em&gt;checks notes&lt;/em&gt;... oh yes, a part-time DJ, no-name Twitch Streamer and he ran the twitter account of Ben Philips, some influencer dude.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/link/q0p7qz/video/c3k47r4jcar71/player?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;amp;utm_name=SafeMoonInvesting&amp;amp;utm_content=t3_q0p7qz\"&gt;Anyway, here&amp;#39;s Jack and Ben Phillips romping around London, eating gold-plated Tomahawk steak at a cost of £1,500 per meal..&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/link/q0p7qz/video/7z7jr9ijdar71/player?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;amp;utm_name=SafeMoonInvesting&amp;amp;utm_content=t3_q0p7qz\"&gt;[Video 2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0kuoaeyydar71.png?width=902&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5be389c715198793978c5a14ed14dbadf87eba8d\"&gt;Looking fresh, Jack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;But what&amp;#39;s the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; story here?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think if people make money off Crypto, that&amp;#39;s fair play. Less so when it&amp;#39;s by stringing along Investors by promising them wealth while delivering products you know are broken (Safemoon wallet released under his watch!)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that all goes out the window when these people repeatedly claimed they didn&amp;#39;t own any Safemoon. So when someone who worked as a part-time DJ suddenly comes into dramatic wealth, it does raise &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; red-flags, especially when they have gone on record over multiple AMA&amp;#39;s saying none of the devs are the whale wallets cashing out millions of dollars at a time...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this behaviour came directly after &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/86u7kvgknom71.jpg\"&gt;handing in his notice&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;quot;toxicity&amp;quot; reasons (perhaps the investors he strung along for 5 months were getting a bit rowdy?)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Toxicity is a weird way to say &amp;quot;Dumping the bags we claimed we never owned&amp;quot;, but, whatever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just another shitcoin story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
