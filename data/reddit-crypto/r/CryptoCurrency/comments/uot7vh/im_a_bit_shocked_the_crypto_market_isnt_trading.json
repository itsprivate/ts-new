The first signs of Bear Stearns failing happened several months before the whole equity market collapsed. I’m not saying that this will happen, but I’m not naive enough to think it can’t happen either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After consulting my crystal ball, I definitely think the crypto market will trade down, up, or sideways from here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you think the market is holding up? Do you also think that we should be trading lower?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
