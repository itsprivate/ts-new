This is going to be the single biggest advertising advent reaching the largest number and demographics of people that crypto has ever had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I believe that just seeing these adverts is going to double our portfolio&amp;#39;s tomorrow? No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I believe that there is going to be any significant price action tomorrow? Certainly not!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I believe that tomorrow is going to be a focal point for the average public to talk about crypto? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what happens every time the public take an interest in crypto? The media always follow through with more reports, articles, predictions etc and the larger investor, realising that the public are likely to start FOMOing in buy up the lower price quickly. And the more attention crypto gets the harder retail predictably starts FOMOing in which causes a feedback loop pushing prices sky high until large investor money swoops out of the market and crashes the price again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So from the charts tomorrow will look like any other day but looking back from the future I bet my sats that it is the beginning of a significant upswing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I apparently have to add that I&amp;#39;m not American, I just appreciate the power advertising to retail especially one of the most lucrative retail markets of Americans that have on average the most disposable income and are the most likely to invest (as they have to as they have no social programmes!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
