Four years ago I was checking prices every 5 minutes, imagining and calculating how big my future imaginary gains would be. Some nights when prices skyrocketed I literally couldn&#39;t sleep properly. Other nights I was worried about not selling the evening before, wondering how much the market will fall while I sleep.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in this for the long-term, don&#39;t do this to yourself. Honestly, it is okay to be interested in crypto, read about it, discuss it, etc.</p>\n\n<p>But being obsessed with it, constantly checking prices, calculating future profits is not a healthy thing to do. It consumes a great proportion of your time and energy, and it&#39;s basically an emotional rollercoaster.</p>\n\n<p>Wishing everyone a successful and healthy HODL! :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
