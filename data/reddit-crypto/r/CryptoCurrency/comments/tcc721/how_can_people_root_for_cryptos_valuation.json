Using my crypto to pay for something leads me to tax exposure, potentially liquidating assets at the wrong time, and reducing potential future gains in the good times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a reason we don’t pay for everyday things in stocks. We may reward them in shares (eg RSUs), but nobody treats stocks as a method of payment because it belongs in the investment assets class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From this POV, how can anyone say they want what behaves like an investment asset with limited supply to serve as a currency?  Shouldn’t the valuation (and supply) of each token aim to be a lot more stable than what most projects offer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: some people are pointing out the existence of stable coins - I know, and that’s kind of the point. I’m puzzled by the constant celebration of non stablecoins being accepted as payment. I think paying for your latte with ETH is what makes zero sense (unless you’re an absolutist).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
