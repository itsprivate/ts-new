I believed in the project, it wasn&amp;#39;t a shitty dog-coin, it was a decentralized casino, which I thought was a novel idea. Today, the team announced they&amp;#39;re ceasing operations, price&amp;#39;s dropped 95%, can&amp;#39;t even withdraw coins from the staking contract from the site, and I don&amp;#39;t wanna even bother with it, cause it&amp;#39;d be a tiny amount. Apparently the devs didn&amp;#39;t sell any coins, which I don&amp;#39;t really believe. What&amp;#39;s worse, I could&amp;#39;ve sold for a nice 2x profit, but I believed in the project and bought the dip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The warning signs were kind of there, the audit had some things that in hindsight, were kind of dodgy. Don&amp;#39;t even know why I&amp;#39;m writing this, I can survive without the money, but it is a real freacking kick in the gut...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lesson 1. Don&amp;#39;t go all in on microcaps (really shouldn&amp;#39;t have done that).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lesson 2. Don&amp;#39;t be an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RIP my folio, won&amp;#39;t have money to invest in crypto for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
