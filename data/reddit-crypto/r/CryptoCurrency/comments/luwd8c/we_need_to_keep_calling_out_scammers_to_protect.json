We have to do a better job at calling these fools out and putting them on our known scammers list. I know many of you already do a great job at this, so thank you and keep up the good work. I think it would be a good idea to have more visibility around a “scammers list” so the good people of our community stay safe from these predators. Countless people in this sub continue to get PM’s from shady accounts which are clear scams. </p>\n\n<p>With so much growth surrounding cryptos, we need to do our best to protect our community from malicious activity. By bringing attention to the scammers in this sub and on discord, we will be doing a service for the crypto community and educating people on how to stay safe!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
