He said yes, that he sold some Eth and made a few hundred. I told him no sell only hold. He said he was &amp;#39;opportunistic&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;didn&amp;#39;t have diamond hands&amp;#39;.  - Just last week we were driving in the car together and he said &amp;#39;All my crypto now are ten year holds&amp;#39; and I could have cried out of happiness.       &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volatility scares people, and we all have to respect that. It will take time for people to come around and &lt;a href=\"https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-import-big-data-animation-abstract-rainbow-spot-light-background-223802827.jpg\"&gt;see this space for all that it holds&lt;/a&gt;; from opportunistic cash grabs to apex dollar hedges, from over leveraged scams to the true start of DAOs that one-day might replace Apple.        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nuance is key! Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago (historian Bernard Berenson said that). Are you still the same hodler you were a year ago?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
