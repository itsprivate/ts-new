  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say to build something during the bear market, so I did!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make something funny to entertain my fellow crypto enthusiasts while the skeptics and haters are taking victory laps about our supposed collapse. Something to document the sheer hatred generated by this new tech we&amp;#39;re all excited about, and mock those who don&amp;#39;t believe in blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;em&gt;Worthless JPEGs!&lt;/em&gt;, a satirical NFT collection of 50 unique pieces made from an anti-crypto quote, a parodic image, a derogatory comment and a QR code pointing to the original comment on Reddit. 40 quotes are taken from Redditors, and 10 comes from famous people (Warren Buffet, Peter Schiff, Dan Olson, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kib6oei3hjf91.png?width=1559&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e9ef3cbeff2fc68b4d87403353f7e0dc64ffa455\"&gt;Wise words from a bulbs collector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All images are CC0 and the quotes are used under the Fair Use doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this collection, my objective is to summarize what skeptics have to say about NFTs, capturing an era that I am sure will be studied for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My NFTs are steeped in crypto culture. First, each quote is accompanied by a provocative signature, in homage to the trolling so common in our ecosystem. Second, they are full of hidden easter eggs alluding to the Ethereum blockchain: can you find them all? Finally, their design evokes generative art, without being derived from it; I have indeed manually created these images, one at a time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, as this is a comedic project, I decided that every &lt;em&gt;Worthless JPEGs!&lt;/em&gt; holders will be airdropped &lt;strong&gt;a new NFT in which I make highly dismissive and bitchy comments in response to the original quote when/if ETH reaches 5k USD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The collection is already minted out (they were 0.003 ETH each), &lt;a href=\"https://stratosnft.io/collection/0x308984CA8292bFbc213cfd23B2F4ef45Bd7835F4\"&gt;but you can see it on Stratos&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest NFT marketplace on Arbitrum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that&amp;#39;ll make you laugh a little bit! Here&amp;#39;s another one, for your pleasure :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9g39d3uxhjf91.png?width=1559&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d126b457db68ec983e41a73303bbec7857bfd17f\"&gt;Dave Troy looks like a very cool-headed analyst!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT : spelling&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
