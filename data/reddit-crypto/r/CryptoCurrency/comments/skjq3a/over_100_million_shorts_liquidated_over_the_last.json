This figure may change quite a bit as it was 85% when I started writing this post and now it&amp;#39;s at 88%. The 122 million figure may change as well as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some simple math of 88% multiplied by 122 million means that approximately 107 million dollars in shorts were liquidated. Take that bears!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, over 50 million dollars were Bitcoin shorts and over 40 million dollars were Ethereum shorts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The largest single liquidation order happened on Okex - BTC-USDT-SWAP valued at $3.18 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past 24 hours, 54542 traders were liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the risk of trading with leverage and the saying &amp;quot;invest only what you can afford to lose&amp;quot; applies the most if you decide to dabble with this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love it when shorts are liquidated. I hope this trend continues and we go onwards and upwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
