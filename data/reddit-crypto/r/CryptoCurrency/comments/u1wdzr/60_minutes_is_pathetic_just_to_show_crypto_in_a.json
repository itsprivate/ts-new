But if you look there on the X-axis you see how they suddenly switched from years to months. This is just pain in my eyes as a  fellow with mathematic  advanced course in college. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only did they completly show a wrong chart but also the year number is wrong with &amp;quot;2121&amp;quot;.  Can someone really fuck up a chart like this and not recheck it? Seems like they intentionally showed it this way to make the viewers feel as if there is no potential growth left in Crypto. Thats just straight up a LIE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media is truely making a complete fool out of themselves. How is someone supposed to trust them for any news, let alone Crypto?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
