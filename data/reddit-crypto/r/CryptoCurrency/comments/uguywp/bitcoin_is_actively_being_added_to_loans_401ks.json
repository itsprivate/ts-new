As many mlhave added Bitcoin ans other cryptos to their balance sheet and as an option for traders to invest in. Also we have just seen the first Bitcoin backed loans from Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear that a lot of mass adoption is happening right now especially from sides that would typically not be that friendly towards crypto. For me personally that is worth more than a 100k Bitcoin. Because what would a 100k Bitcoin help me if the price is not sustainable and there is not actual backing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
