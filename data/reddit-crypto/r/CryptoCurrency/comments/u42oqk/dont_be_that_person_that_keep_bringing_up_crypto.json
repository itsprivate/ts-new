It&amp;#39;s better if you join a community, discord, telegram or other platform to talk about those kind of things and not create uncomfortable situations or even resentment because you for example shilled a project and it flopped, and now they think it&amp;#39;s on you because you&amp;#39;re one the who &amp;#39;&amp;#39;advised&amp;#39;&amp;#39; to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like in this sub when you downvote people who shill what they have in their portfolio, don&amp;#39;t shill crypto to people who aren&amp;#39;t interested and get downvoted IRL for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
