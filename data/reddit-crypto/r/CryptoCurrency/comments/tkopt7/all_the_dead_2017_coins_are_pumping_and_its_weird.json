Ethereum Classic is the top gainer (+82%), but others like Dash (+36%), Bitcoin Cash (+27%), Zcash (+27%) and EOS (+25%) are in the top gainers as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That feels a bit weird. Why the sudden spike of those coins nobody usually cares about anymore? Purely anecdotally, this feels like a bad sign, as I seem to remember coins like that pumping has happened shortly before dumps in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think, just the randomness of crypto? Or am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: just to clarify (as some have rightly made comments about this): all those coins are still down &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; from their ATHs, they just performed better than almost all other coins in the past week&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
