Truth is no one knows how far down market will go and if or when it will bounce back. Interest rates are tipped to rise, we are on brink of a war, Omicron is out of control and the bad news keep piling up. Point is, don’t take anyone’s advice because in crypto world no one has any idea what will happen next. Keep your money safe and don’t make decisions that’ll make you miserable. I have invested at wrong times many times now and I know the feeling. It’s awful. So assess your personal situation and expect for things to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
