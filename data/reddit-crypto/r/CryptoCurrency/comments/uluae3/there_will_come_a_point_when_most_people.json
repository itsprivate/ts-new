You yourself will start to wonder if crypto can recover, and will probably start to think that crypto could actually just be dead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As strange as it may seem now, it will be really really difficult to convince yourself to buy at that point. While the prices will be incredibly low, the overall sentiment will be that crypto will never see ATH ever again, and you won&amp;#39;t want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That will be the best time to buy, as it has been in the past, and we aren’t close to that point yet. We still have many more months, maybe even a year or more before that point. A good barometer for the bottom will be when you yourself start to think that crypto could be dead and will not recover. Those who have the conviction to buy at that point will make out the best in the next bull run, just like they have in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
