  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Munger, the Vice-Chair of Berkshire Hathaway and colloquially known as Warren Buffet&amp;#39;s right hand man took on BTC during Berkshire Hathaways annual shareholder meeting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There he called Bitcoin &amp;quot;stupid because it’s very likely to go to zero&amp;quot; and also praised Chinese leader Xi Jinping for banning BTC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also claimed that Bitcoin is &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;. Yet his company Berkshire Hathaway invested $28 billion in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum in just the first 3 months of 2022. The same Chevron that is responsible for one of the &lt;a href=\"https://europeangreens.eu/brussels2013/content/chevron-texaco-and-environmental-disaster-amazon\"&gt;worst ecological disasters in history &lt;/a&gt;when it dumped over 18.5 billion gallons of toxic water into the Amazon rainforest contaminating two million acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why did he call BTC evil? For its environmental effects? &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/charlie-munger-bitcoin-stupid-evil-bad\"&gt;Nope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;it’s evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System and national currency system, which we desperately need to maintain its integrity and government control and so on&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the mindset of these people. Evil doesnt mean destroying the world. Evil is anything that tries to disrupt the status quo. God forbid anyone else becomes rich!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
