Soany very quick enough to call this the bottom. But literally everything higher than the 4 hour Charts are looking bearish as hell right now. With the stock market too looking even more bearish than Crypto right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if you just think logically of we reverse now this would be the shortest bear marjet Crypto has ever had. And all that in the midst of probably the worst macro-economic outlook since 2008 or even way further down. Also while we are on the brink of a recession that every politician is denying just like they denied inflation a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wanna be bearish or so, I&amp;#39;m just trying to remain realistic and obviously we can&amp;#39;t predict the next word events or so. But right now it&amp;#39;s woukd be a way safer bet to go with the trend and not oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
