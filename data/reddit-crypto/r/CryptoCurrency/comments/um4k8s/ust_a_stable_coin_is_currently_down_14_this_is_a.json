I obviously don’t want to see anyone or anything fail, but it really is important to read everything with an open heart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you straight up ignore all advice that is contrary to what you want to hear, you are setting yourself up for failure. The Safemoon sub is the prime example of the echo chamber that just won’t listen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please. If someone warns you against something, try to find reason in it. Is it possible they are correct? Challenge it, and ask or clarify your misunderstandings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t want this post to come across as a “told you so” at all. Although I’m sure many commenters will say exactly that. The point I’m trying to make is to please listen to both sides at all times. It is usually quite easy to discern between someone just spreading FUD and someone who is trying to challenge the merits of a project. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I do to help me understand all issues is to join the subs or projects I’m not involved in, as well as those I am involved in. I need to hear all sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
