Apparently, &amp;quot;for my safety&amp;quot; I cannot transfer more than $2000 in ETH per hour. With incredibly high-gas fees on Ethereum right now, it&amp;#39;s obviously best to avoid unnecessary transactions. No problem, I&amp;#39;m a hodlr anyway, but if I&amp;#39;m gonna hodl I figured that I might as well earn some decent interest on my coins. I thought I&amp;#39;d stake them on Coinbase or lend to a liquidity pool or something, but if I have to pay $1000s in transaction fees, then what amount of APY will be worth it? Is this it? Am I stuck in  Robinhood&amp;#39;s interest-less purgatory while the rest of the industry offers 4.5-8.5% APY?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Robinhood, you figured out how to prevent the crypto-exodus we all know you were fearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
