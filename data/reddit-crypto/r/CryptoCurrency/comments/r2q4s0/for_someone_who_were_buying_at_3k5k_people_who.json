Either 90% people here or at age 15 trying crypto first time or you really like to FOMO and panic sell.</p>\n\n<p>For people who watched BTC for over 5+ years will know that BTC many times crashes %70 %80 in 12 hours. You would wake up to see BTC is down %50 then you went to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Always think about percentages, not numbers. 5k$ means nothing when BTC is 50k$. That&#39;s %10. That&#39;s nothing. When BTC goes to 55k$ from 5k$, you&#39;re making %10 gain. Not 5k$. Don&#39;t look at the price. Look at the change.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, if you wanna know when it&#39;s bear market I have an clue for you: It&#39;s when people (who now says they are HODLers) starts to open threads in <a href=\"/r/cc\">r/cc</a> about their mental health and leaving crypto for it. </p>\n\n<p>You will never time the market. You see people thought BTC would never hit 10k$ again when it hit 20k$ ATH first time. Then it went down to 10k$, 8k$, then crashed %70 like 12 hours to 3.5k$. No one thought that bull run would be %100 erased. It did. It took like 3 years to bear market reverse but in that time, %99 &quot;hodlers&quot; got off the train.</p>\n\n<p>Same thing would happen if bear market starts. BTC would hit 30k$. You guys would buy thinking it&#39;s dip from %50 off from ATH. It would dip even more. Panic sell starts, even strong hands turn into weak. Then new bull cycle starts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I remember buying at 5k$ (after 20k$ ath in bear market) and came to this sub, there was absolutely no one. Not even 1k online people LOL. Now everybody gives hope in %1 changes here.  No one can here has idea how BTC price works.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>But I can tell you one thing, buy BTC a lot when you have no one to talk in this sub</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
