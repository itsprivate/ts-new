Not to mention the comment sections with &amp;quot;hodl hodl hodl ðŸš€&amp;quot; and bots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;90% of people are here because of the money, 9% of the people are here because of the memes and the remaining 1% isnt loud enough to make the community look more serious than it actually is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is also an obstacle for the mass adoption of crypto.\nImagine nations depending on cryptos with communities like dogecoin&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do y&amp;#39;all think?
