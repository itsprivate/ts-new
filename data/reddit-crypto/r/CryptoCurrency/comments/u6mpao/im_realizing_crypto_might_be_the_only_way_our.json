Where I live, the average house is around 790k (no I don’t live in a big city like Toronto or Vancouver) and rent for a 1 bedroom is averaging about $1500 a month plus utilities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard your parents or grandparents say what they bought their houses/cars for? Even though their wages were slightly less, it doesn’t make up for the increase in cost of living today, not to mention inflation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simply working more, or trying to find a high paying job isnt enough anymore. I’m starting to think crypto might be our generations once in a lifetime opportunity. My girlfriend and I are both working professionals and buying a house in this market is almost unattainable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which cryptos do you think will offer the best chance at making life changing money within say 5 years? Because life changing money is what it’s going to take with today’s cost of living + inflation vs current wages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S, I’m betting on Ada, CKB, Link and Ergo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
