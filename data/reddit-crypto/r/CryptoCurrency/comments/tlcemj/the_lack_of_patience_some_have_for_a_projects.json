Projects can take years and years to develop and grow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In August of 2015, ETH was a little over $.70, and it took two years to get to $270. I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re thinking, &amp;quot;Oh, that&amp;#39;s not long, I would have held. &amp;quot;, but in the same breath, declare an alt dead after a few months. I&amp;#39;m not saying every alt is destined for ETH&amp;#39;s success, but I don&amp;#39;t think we can predict their future success in such a short time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think some of these projects we all talk about, the good ones, can get up there, but I&amp;#39;m ready to wait years to see it happen. More often than not, great success can be made on the back of failure. Projects will have growing pains; that&amp;#39;s just the nature of business. Nothing goes straight up and stays up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the guy who sold his BTC for pizzas taught us anything, it&amp;#39;s to have patience with our crypto and our projects. The ones who have restraint are the ones most handsomely rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
