  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been working in digital for over twenty years, and the first time I heard about crypto was from one of my fellow devs who was mining Doge in 2014. I bought about $50 worth of it back then and ended up losing access to wherever it was stored at the time. No big deal, it was my first lesson in this crypto journey, one of many. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After years of not paying much attention to crypto and working on other investments; stocks, real estate, retirement funds, etc. I came back to the space in 2019 with a renewed passion and drive. Stocks had always bored me, I never felt like it was a market I related with, and since I work in digital, crypto makes sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I got back into Doge because that&amp;#39;s where I started. And then BTC and then ETH all around the same time in 2019. Then came alts, and with them came tons of research and discovery, buying projects I believe in. The crypto world&amp;#39;s volatility didn&amp;#39;t scare me then, and it doesn&amp;#39;t scare me now because I think it&amp;#39;s the future, and I refuse to sit on fiat that isn&amp;#39;t working for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this fine new year, and I am so proud to have grown my portfolio to what it is today. To be a woman in this space, understand the fundamentals, and withstand the fear is very empowering. So to all the women out there who are either veterans in the crypto space or newbies, keep going!! It&amp;#39;s an honor to invest alongside all of you! And cheers to the men out there crushing it too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: this is absolutely not an anti-man post! Yeesh! Men rock! This is more about women having confidence to invest, learn, grow and become financially independent. Ultimately being able to build an empire with their crypto loving mate!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
