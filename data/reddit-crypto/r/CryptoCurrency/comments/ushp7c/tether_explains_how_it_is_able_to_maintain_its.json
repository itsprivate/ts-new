  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tether&amp;#39;s official website released an article named &amp;quot;How Tether USD₮ Is Able to Maintain Its Peg When Other Stablecoins Fall&amp;quot;. So, there should be a professional explanation about their reserves? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire article is pretty much useless:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given the recent losses UST investors suffered, many users may be questioning if they can trust Tether USD₮ given the spectacular collapse of UST.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, all one needs to do is look at the history and track record of Tether USD₮.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tether USD₮ has been relied on as the primary form of dollar-based liquidity in the crypto market for many years and the crypto market has not been without its share of dramatic crashes! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, what is this? They are saying they should be trusted entirely based on their track record, with no other explanation whatsoever??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first half of the page is useless, so what about the second half? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second half of the article is titled &amp;quot;How Does an Algorithmic Stablecoin Work?&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s ALL they are talking about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While UST is referred to as a stablecoin, it has nothing in common with collateralized stablecoins like Tether USD₮. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, they are using UST as a scapegoat instead of addressing their reserves or any explanation of how they maintain their peg. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://tether.to/en/how-tether-usdt-is-able-to-maintain-its-peg-when-other-stablecoins-fall/?fbclid=IwAR38zybf2sEcEoRfH2avk8IxmZUe6R77AGpceIykVihyMK7GIHnx4ON9VP8\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire article is a joke and you should go read it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
