Their number increased by more than 13,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During these trying times, its interesting to watch the strategy of El Salvador’s Bitcoin-boosting president.  His recent tweet on Twitter was, “Bitcoin is the future! Thank you for selling cheap.” and he keeps buying the dip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere( not verified) that he buys the dip from &amp;#39;Public funds&amp;#39;. Either he is a visionary or a disaster. Only time will tell. Meanwhile I see a true Diamond hand in him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
