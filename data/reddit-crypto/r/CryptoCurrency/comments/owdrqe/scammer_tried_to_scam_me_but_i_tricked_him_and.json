  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So up until today, I&#39;ve got 3 scammers PM me and say that they own a company and that they can increase my profits (this is the most basic type of scam imo.) I made a post some time ago about one of them, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/olhryu/someone_tried_to_scam_me_if_we_want_crypto/\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>The scammer who PM&#39;d me today was incredible stupid. Like...the stupidest of the stupid.</p>\n\n<p>Here is our convo: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/eDk7ZSU\">http://imgur.com/a/eDk7ZSU</a></p>\n\n<p>He said that he owns this website - eclisetrades.com\nand asked me to make an account there and deposit 2 BTC. (lol)</p>\n\n<p>I asked him to send me 0.0001 BTC as proof that he is legit, and then when he sends me, I&#39;ll deposit 2 BTC in his website, I registered to his website just so he gets convinced. Don&#39;t worry, I opened it in a browser that has no passwords or anything saved and opened it in incognito tab, as an ex-webdev I know what data someone can and cannot steal.</p>\n\n<p>and he.... LITERALLY, being the stupidest scammer of all time, sent it to my address.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t really care about the free $4 that I got from him, the best part is that I wasted his time. He could&#39;ve used that time to successfully scam someone.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, this is my new address that he sent the BTC to - <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1P9s7qn4eLCwJyMWo7RE1vDAHarHM2EXPz\">https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1P9s7qn4eLCwJyMWo7RE1vDAHarHM2EXPz</a></p>\n\n<p>And this is the scammer&#39;s address (he asks people to send BTC to this address on his website, too, and his latest transaction is him sending me BTC) -\n<a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/169Jt7BTHRA2MRNP5ADbmhDmxcTyMozTPV\">https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/169Jt7BTHRA2MRNP5ADbmhDmxcTyMozTPV</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s really sad that he has received over $12K worth BTC and sent all of that out to others. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s got all that money by scamming or something but I hope karma gets him.</p>\n\n<p>Please be aware of scammers, if someone PMs you saying that they are a company and can increase your profits or anything of that sort, either block them or waste their time, just don&#39;t get convinced and send them anything.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
