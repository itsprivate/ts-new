  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>When I was new to crypto, I made it a point to list down all the dodgy people who approached me online and tried to bait me into a scam. I posted my list a few months ago and a lot of other people chimed in with even more scams since then.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the updated list:</p>\n\n<h1>1. The Youtube/Facebook &quot;live&quot; stream</h1>\n\n<p>Scammers download an old online event from a reputable company (ex: Apple) or an interview with a respected crypto personality (ex: Vitalik, Charles, and other cyrpto founders). They stream this on Youtube or Facebook with their own overlay text or graphics, and pretend it&#39;s an official or new event that&#39;s happening right now. </p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s a honeypot where they use the live chat to get victims from the people who are watching. They use the legitimacy and star power of the content they&#39;re streaming to lure you in one of the scams in this list because surely Apple wouldn&#39;t scam you right?</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Official events are announced in official channels, and not by a Facebook page called &#39;Cryptophiles Futures Advice &amp; Investments Society&quot;.</p>\n\n<h1>2. Try my strategy platform bro, it&#39;s made me $40,000 DOLLARS already this month</h1>\n\n<p>If you post or comment on any crypto subreddit, you will 100% get messages in your inbox. </p>\n\n<p>Some of them will even be from people who are so kind that they want to help a crypto newbie like yourself by letting you in on their strategy, trading platform, or exchange. And it&#39;s free!</p>\n\n<p>Best case scenario is any coins or tokens you buy will be theirs for the taking and won&#39;t be withdrawable. What usually happens is they get your credit card info when you sign up. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Don&#39;t talk to strangers online. </p>\n\n<h1>3. Oops I accidentally sent you my wallet&#39;s seedphrase please don&#39;t transfer my coins into your wallet</h1>\n\n<p>This one is really funny because it preys on people who want to take advantage of others.</p>\n\n<p>Someone will &quot;accidentally&quot; reveal the phrase to their wallet that actually contains real Eth and other crypto in it. Opportunists looking for a quick buck will access the wallet, but to send it to their own wallet they need to send Eth to it first to pay for gas transfer fees. </p>\n\n<p>Surprise! You just donated your Eth to a scammer because they have a bot that automatically seizes any Eth it receives. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Don&#39;t be an asshole.</p>\n\n<h1>4. This is official Binance/Kraken/Crypto.com helpdesk representative. You need help?</h1>\n\n<p>When I was new, I asked your usual questions like how to trade, what are the recommended wallets,  and how do I stake. </p>\n\n<p>Immediately after, I had these assholes send me grammatically painful private messages, giving generic advice and pretending to be from Binance or whatever. </p>\n\n<p>Since I don&#39;t have a wallet yet, they pushed me to open one on their website. It actually doesn&#39;t look like a scam site, but of course they&#39;re fake copies of legitimate wallets. </p>\n\n<p>Once you transfer money to this wallet, they&#39;ll rob you blind. </p>\n\n<h1>5. &quot;You need to connect your wallet to the dapps token interface&quot;</h1>\n\n<p>That&#39;s an actual message my friend received after asking a question on a reputable and rising 3-letter blockchain&#39;s subreddit. </p>\n\n<p>They tried to confuse her with big words like that, then gave instructions to &quot;help&quot; her sort everything out. Eventually, it just led to them asking for her seed phrase to &quot;troubleshoot&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t. </p>\n\n<h1>6. Limited time event! Send our company 1 ETH and we&#39;ll send you 2 ETH back.</h1>\n\n<p>I saw this first on Twitter, but they&#39;ve expanded to Reddit DMs now. </p>\n\n<p>Spoiler alert: they won&#39;t send you ETH back. </p>\n\n<h1>7. My investments had an amazing month and want to share my blessings. Here&#39;s some free random coins!</h1>\n\n<p>This is either a dusting attack or they just wanted to steal my coins straight. </p>\n\n<p>How it works is, if you try to transfer, sell, or convert them you&#39;ll find that you need to visit a specific swap site and give permission for them to access your wallet. </p>\n\n<p>By access I mean steal the contents. Don&#39;t touch them. </p>\n\n<p>Vitalik is the only selfless angel in crypto and he&#39;s not in your DMs.</p>\n\n<h1>8. Search for [Wallet Name/Website Name] on Google</h1>\n\n<p>These asshats start by giving good and accurate info about crypto. I actually learned a lot from them. </p>\n\n<p>However, they tell me to Google the name of a real wallet or exchange to use instead of giving the actual site. </p>\n\n<p>This is because they bought an ad so that their copycat site shows up at the top of search results, above the actual legitimate wallet or website. If I downloaded the app or wallet on their site, then they would&#39;ve gotten access to my coins. </p>\n\n<p>Only download apps and wallets from official websites. </p>\n\n<h1>TLDR</h1>\n\n<p>There are multiple scams that thrive in Reddit. They specifically target newcomers who ask for crypto help or advice in comments/posts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
