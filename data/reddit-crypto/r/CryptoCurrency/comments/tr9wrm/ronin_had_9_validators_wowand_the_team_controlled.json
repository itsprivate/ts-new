He can play with the market though cashing out would seem difficult at this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Tornado cash is not 100% fool proof, as the recent NFT rugpull bust by DOJ suggests.. In that case the rug pull scammers used tornado to wash their coins but still got caught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case it seems the hacker is already sending funds to CEX which means he is most likely KYCed or using fakes..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
