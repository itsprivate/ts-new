I&#39;ve been reading success stories about cryptocurrency for a few years now, and I always thought it was never meant for me because I&#39;m not the kind of guy that has a few thousand dollars to spare on a gamble. But browsing this sub for a while, I learned that you don&#39;t need a few thousand dollars to get started. </p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, a good friend of mine gave me a tip on a fairly new alt coin that looks promising, and I have just doubled my small investment so far. I would have never gotten into it if it hadn&#39;t been for this sub.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing all these &quot;only invest what you can afford&quot; advices gave me the push I needed. Until then, I thought crypto was meant for already fairly rich people who only want to get even more rich. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not one of those people. I&#39;m a 31 year old single guy who makes a decent amount of money, but I can&#39;t apply for the mortgage I want because the bank thinks it&#39;s too much of a risk for a single income household.</p>\n\n<p>I have savings. Enough to pay for the costs that go with buying property, not enough for the bank to trust me.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t need a fancy Lamborghini or an indoor swimming pool. I just want to buy my own place. If a crypto profit of a few thousand bucks gets me there, that would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>If I lose my investment, so be it. At least I&#39;ve tried. </p>\n\n<p>So again, thank all of you for unknowingly giving this stranger the push he needed towards being a little more comfortable financially.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Wow, never have my posts ever received even one award. I didn&#39;t thought this was going to be the one that would, and then suddenly receiving 9 awards? You guys are a really heartwarming community!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
