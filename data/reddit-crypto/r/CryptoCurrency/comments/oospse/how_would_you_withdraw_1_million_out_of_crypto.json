Would it be safe to have that amount of money in one place? Would you swap it all to fiat at once or leave some in stablecoin? </p>\n\n<p>Let’s say you convert it all to fiat, what do you do next with that amount of money? Do you put it in a savings account even though they are only insured up to $250k? Do you leave it in your checking account, etc?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong> for people messaging me asking if I have this amount, I do NOT! Just trying figure out what I’ll do if my BAT, DOT, OMI, or MTRG take me too the moon. Please save your time trying to scam me 🤪</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
