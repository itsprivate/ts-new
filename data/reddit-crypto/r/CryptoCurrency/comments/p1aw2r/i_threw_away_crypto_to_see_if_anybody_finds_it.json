So I decided the best way was to make 5 copies of the laminated card (approx business card size) and leave them in separate areas that has a total population of approx 200,000 people. The 5 cards took 2 days to distribute as I didn’t want to leave them too close to each other. </p>\n\n<p>It’s been around 7 hours since the last one was placed and so far there’s no movement! </p>\n\n<p>Will it stay or will it go! 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
