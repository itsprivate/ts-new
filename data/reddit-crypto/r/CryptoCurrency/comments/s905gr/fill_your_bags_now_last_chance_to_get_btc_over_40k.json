With Bitcoin right at the $40k mark, this will be the last time in the foreseeable future you’ll be able to buy it this high a price. It’s time to go all-in and prove that you truly have diamond hands. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is my strategy-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- early withdraw my 401k and invest it in BTC&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- get as many personal loans as I can and use those to buy ETH above $3k&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3- go to the bank and get a reverse mortgage on my home &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With these 3 simple steps, I can set myself up to show that I have diamond hands and believe in crypto. It will lead to wife-changing money, as she will divorce me and I can focus purely on crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also going to pressure my family and friends to invest blindly into crypto. If they can survive the next 3 years if a crypto winter, they will earn my respect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buy high, sell low. Not financial advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
