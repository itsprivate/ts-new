  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen some discussion on this sub recently blaming some people that they are here only to make profit. To make quick money. &amp;quot;Why do you care about price going up or down if you are never selling?&amp;quot; and other silly arguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you. Yes the majority here, is in it for the money. It&amp;#39;s because we are screwed. The society is still expecting an average male to earn a lot of money and provide for their family etc. but people in their 30s have been f**d in the arse for the last 15 years or more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No wage growth, no prospects in many countries, constant financial crisis that keeps hitting and hitting us from all sides, and now inflation which will melt our savings, that is if we are lucky to have any savings in the first place, education system is a joke in most countries, crippling debts, high cost of living, rents going up and up, and so on and on, I could go on forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto for a lot of us is the only way out, our only way to be able to afford a house or a flat in the future. So yeah, you bet I&amp;#39;m in it for the money and I don&amp;#39;t give a damn what people think. Priority number one for me is to provide for my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you for the rewards, please but don&amp;#39;t spend money on me. Instead, please donate to Ukrainian charities: \n&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/tgc00n/want_to_support_ukraine_heres_a_list_of_charities/\"&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/tgc00n/want_to_support_ukraine_heres_a_list_of_charities/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
