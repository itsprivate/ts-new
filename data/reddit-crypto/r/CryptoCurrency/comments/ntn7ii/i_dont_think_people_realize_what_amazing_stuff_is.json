The advantages of this new network include “no fees, no blocks, no chain, no miners, no wasted energy, no censorship, no centralization, no permissions.&quot;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We could go into more detail why both of these releases bring incredible value for the whole crypto space, but this would go beyond the scope of this thread. I add some links to further articles, videos and general IOTA stuff I am amazed by.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://v2.iota.org/visualizer\">Visualizer</a> of the decentralized Devnet (my favorite thing to show right now, looks so beautiful 😍)<br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iotaledger\">Github Account</a><br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.iota.org/\">Developer documentation</a><br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://firefly.iota.org/\">Firefly Wallet</a><br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/iotafoundation/videos\">IOTA Foundation Youtube Channel</a> with weekly (now monthly) AMAs from Co-Founder Dom Schiener (last one was 2 days ago). You can also ask your questions, just hop over to <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Iota/\">r/Iota</a> and post them into the AMA thread.<br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/HelloIOTA/videos\">Hello IOTA Youtube Channe</a>l &amp; <a href=\"https://iota-beginners-guide.com/\">IOTA Beginners Guide</a> and for getting started and easier understanding of the whole IOTA infrastructure &amp; architecture</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So maybe by now you have heard about IOTA, but what is <strong>STMicroelectronics</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>For me at least, even as a software dev, I was not aware of it a few weeks ago. STMicroelectronics is a “French-Italian Dutch-domiciled multinational <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics\">electronics</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor\">semiconductors</a> manufacturer [...] resulting from the merger of two government-owned semiconductor companies in 1987” (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics\">Source</a>). Last year, their yearly revenue increased to <strong>over 10 Billion Dollars</strong> (<a href=\"https://investors.st.com/news-releases/news-release-details/stmicroelectronics-reports-q4-and-fy-2020-financial-results\">Source</a>).<br/>\nThey are operating in too many fields to break down here (look at their <a href=\"https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html\">website</a> under “products), but one field I am extremely bullish on where DLTs can have an remarkable impact is the <em>automotive industry</em>. STMicroelectronics ranks here as the <strong>5th largest semiconductor supplier</strong> <strong>worldwide</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/infineon-becomes-king-auto-2019-06/\">Source</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Amazing use cases are possible if a ST microcontroller is being used in the car you are driving, for example stuff like this here (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwVf4t8bhl8\">Video</a>) from <a href=\"https://www.etogruppe.com/\">ETO Group</a> &amp; funded by the German Federal Ministry of Transportation and Digital Infrastructure could become reality. What also helps is that IOTA is part of <a href=\"https://dlt.mobi/\">MOBI</a> (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) to explore future use cases for DLT in the mobility ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>If you are creative enough, maybe you have more ideas for machine-to-machine communication DLT use cases in the automotive field or any other business sectors that use machines.</p>\n\n<p>Why so extremely bullish on the partnership between IOTA &amp; STMicroelectronics?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They are an incredible huge company</li>\n<li>Specialized in the IOT/M2M communication field that also IOTA focuses on</li>\n<li>And now after the IOTA Devnet 2.0 got released, they published this beautiful <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ST_World/status/1400391942521950208\">tweet</a> (lots of shiny IOTA coins in the beginning 😍) and published <a href=\"https://blog.st.com/x-cube-iota1/\">this blog post</a> on their website.<br/>\nThey used their manpower &amp; resources to develop their own “IOTA Distributed Ledger Technology software expansion” for their STM32 microcontroller You can read about reasons, advantages and so on why they chose IOTA in the blog post, but for the lazy ones I want to leave the biggest one: The software extension takes “advantage of the new <strong>IOTAs Chrysalis that can perform 600 million transactions for the same amount of energy as one Bitcoin transaction</strong>”. Another special paragraph is “<em>The New Face of IOTA</em>” - read it if you are still thinking that IOTA hasn&#39;t matured a lot over the past 4 years.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you are a technical person, you can look into the software yourself (<a href=\"https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-expansion-packages/x-cube-iota1.html\">Source</a>). If you don&#39;t know enough about this topic, be a smart investor and think/learn about projects that create true value. And no, even if it sounds highly appealing, 20% staking rewards for a useless currency that nobody uses is <em>not</em> valuable in the future.</p>\n\n<p>My opinion:<br/>\nJust realize that you are still so incredibly early for mainstream adoption. In this whole crypto space we don&#39;t have fully functional projects right now, <em>everything</em> is in development. But you should invest in projects that can have a huge impact on the future. For me personally, it is just inevitable that machines will need a <strong>secure, scalable, energy-efficient and feeless communication mechanism</strong> in the future - and IMO this will bring value in a way that more automation of processes will be possible than we can imagine right now. I don&#39;t recommend investing your money into IOTA in particular, but please do your own research and think about partnerships that really matter in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
