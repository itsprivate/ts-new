  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the crypto world seems to have a very black and white view of inflation and deflation: inflation bad, deflation good. In reality, it&amp;#39;s not that easy though. For currencies, very high inflation is, of course, bad - I probably don&amp;#39;t have to explain to you why hyperinflation is not really what you want to happen to your currency. But most economists would agree that low inflation is fine or even desirable. If a currency is very slowly losing value, citizens have a motivation to spend their money, keeping the economy alive and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When there&amp;#39;s deflation, people have an incentive to just keep &amp;quot;hodling&amp;quot; their money. If you need to make a big purchase, why buy now and not in a few years, once you get more for your money? This discourages consumption, leading to shrinking economies, job losses etc etc. While I am personally far from a right-winger, even libertarians (which is, I would guess, what most people on here identify as economically) like &lt;a href=\"https://butnowyouknow.net/those-who-fail-to-learn-from-history/hayeks-1932-letter-on-the-great-depression/\"&gt;Friedrich von Hayek&lt;/a&gt; agreed that deflation is absolutely undesirable for a currency. While it&amp;#39;s even undesirable short term, a deflation that&amp;#39;s programmed into the currency and is a permanent part of it, would make it unusable as a currency. I would even go so far to say that low inflation that is constant or decreases over time (e.g. by creating the same, low-ish amount of tokens every day, leading to a low inflation that decreases at time goes on as the number of new tokens makes up a smaller share of the total amount of coins over time) would be a better trait for a currency than a hard cap (which is de facto slightly deflationary due to lost coins).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, many new projects promote themselves as being deflationary - most likely as this seems like a positive trait for people not very informed about the issue. Just know that, if you buy a deflationary coin, it is an asset, but never will be a currency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: low inflation might not be as bad; deflation might be worse than you think. deflationary crypto currencies will never be real currencies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
