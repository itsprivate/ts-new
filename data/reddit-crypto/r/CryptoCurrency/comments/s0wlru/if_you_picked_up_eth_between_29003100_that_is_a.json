I&amp;#39;m out of money now, but I have an average ETH buy price of $2984...which I think is pretty good. I&amp;#39;m hodling this for the intermediate term because I expect the price of ETH to rise as the date for ETH 2.0 (a.k.a. The Merge) draws nearer. Any ETH traders that are shorting right now should definitely make sure you close out before the date is confirmed because the hype will come on fast and you&amp;#39;ll get rekt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, there could be another delay in the launch which, to be fair, would not be great. But if you check out the number of commits on github for ETH 2 clients, many reference improvements to clients for the merge which tells me the devs are working hard at it. I like it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strap in, its going to be a bumpy but very fun year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
