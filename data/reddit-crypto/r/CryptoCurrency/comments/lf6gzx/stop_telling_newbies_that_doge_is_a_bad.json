So does this mean ethereum and doge should be on the same level? Obviously not, they serve different purposes. One being a base for an entire crypto eco system, and the other being a fun introduction to crypto for most people. Fiat currency has an infinite supply, and this is &quot;normal&quot; for most people. Obviously most of us believe this is not good, but its hard to convince someone who is new to crypto that it isn&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>Everyone with experience in this market knows the rises like doge had recently are not sustainable in the long run, but I believe all type of publicity is good for crypto in this case. Our job is to caution new comers, and thats all. We shouldn&#39;t think of ourselves as the safekeepers who need to protect newbies for their own good. That comes of as arrogant and makes us just look like we&#39;re salty our coins aren&#39;t pumping. </p>\n\n<p>Many people will get burned, and some may never come back. But some will reevaluate their decisions, and will become exposed to the wold of crypto which will drive growth in the long term</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
