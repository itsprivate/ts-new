As there are not many who know much about crypto yet just as I one year ago, I&amp;#39;m finally good at something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will gather a lot of knowledge about crypto in just a very small time, eventhough it&amp;#39;s pretty complex all you will want to do it as it either actually interests you or you just think it should interest you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With time going the knowledge is going to expand and you will know what crypto is about. And if you support that idea you won&amp;#39;t care about short term prices anymore. The only thing you would want is that crypto becomes even more successful, more known. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s all going shift from money to knowledge, from short term to long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
