It’s only capable of running relatively basic smart contracts because...</li>\n<li><strong>Layer 2</strong> is used for the more customizable smart contracts that are executed &quot;off-chain&quot;, which are more demanding and require more specialized &quot;tools&quot; ie. written in more intricate code.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>More on the architecture of the blockchain <a href=\"https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/algorand-smart-contract-architecture\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>All of this data is secured by Algorand’s PPoS consensus algorithm</strong>. From their own words:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Algorand uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) protocol built on Byzantine consensus. <strong>Each user’s influence on the choice of a new block is proportional to its stake (number of tokens) in the system. Users are randomly and secretly selected to propose blocks and vote on block proposals. All online users have the chance to be selected to propose and vote.</strong> The likelihood that a user will be chosen, and the weight of its proposals and votes, are directly proportional to its stake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Algorand’s PPoS approach ties the security of the whole economy to the honesty of the majority of the economy, rather than to that of a small subset of the economy. The system is secure when most of the money is in honest hands. With other approaches (outlined below), a small subset of the economy determines the security of the whole economy, which means just a few users can prevent other users from transacting. In Algorand, it is impossible for the owners of a small fraction of the money to harm the whole system, and it would be foolish for the owners of the majority of the money to misbehave as it would diminish the currency’s purchasing power and ultimately devalue their own assets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Emphasis mine. The selection of block proposers and voters is non-interactive.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>How do I buy some?</h1>\n\n<p>To purchase “algos” you&#39;ll want to find an exchange that offers the Algorand coin ($ALGO) and sign up. Some well-known exchanges are <strong>Coinbase</strong> and <strong>Kraken</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For a more comprehensive list of places to buy from, click <a href=\"https://www.finder.com/how-to-buy-algorand\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From there you can hold your coins in whichever exchange you choose or you can transfer your coins to the official Algorand wallet: <a href=\"https://algorandwallet.com/\">https://algorandwallet.com/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Either way <strong>you&#39;ll be earning about 6% interest on your coins automatically</strong>.
