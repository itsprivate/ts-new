  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I&amp;#39;m about to receive a $200k inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried stocks for around 4 years and it never really felt something native to my generation (Gen Z). Overall I believe in crypto more, but I recognize the risks involved with it as I&amp;#39;ve been dabbling in them since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been looking into stablecoins and generating passive yields with these, but I want to find something which has some form of insurance or low risk of the money suddenly disappearing due to a hack or similar. Basically, I want to be sure that my inheritance money won&amp;#39;t disappear within the next 3-5 years minimum, and ideally, I want to be able to take out a portion of the yield to live off of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do own a hardware wallet so I would be ok with storing the funds there. I found a stablecoin called OUSD, which seems to cover my needs together with an added 3rd party insurance, but the protocol does not seem to be that known and has USDT exposure, which is why I am a little bit hesitant as of right now. I&amp;#39;m happy to hear if anyone has positive experience with it though. I am also happy to hear if anyone has other recommendations on what you would do with $200k to create a yield to live off of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am based in Europe (in case there are any CEX recommendations that only have US-specific insurances).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: People are telling me to be careful with DMs, funnily enough it did indeed blow up but I&amp;#39;ve been in the game long enough to know not to click anything, thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
