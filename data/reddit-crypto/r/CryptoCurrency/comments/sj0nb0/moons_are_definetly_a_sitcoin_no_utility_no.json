Over the longterm the utility always wins and hype leaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But thus subs own crypto MOONS are also, definitely, a shitcoin. It&amp;#39;s far away from any utility, let liquidy be it is not even listed on ANY good-enough exchanges, let alone the major ones. There is no easy or understandable way from selling those apart from a 45 step swap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there is no real roadmap for the near future with specific dates. The only thing we know is that a mainnet is coming. Someday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I definitely do not say MOONS will forever be shit, but they for now are and there is no point against that and in also sure people are currently working to change that and I appreciate those people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t push MOONS as some breakout crypto for now...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
