  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: I swear, if another person says &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s why I mostly hold BTC and ETH&amp;quot;... it makes no sense. About half the coins performed better than BTC since then. It&amp;#39;s fine to mostly hold BTC and ETH, but this is not a reason to do so.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A year ago, the marked looked pretty great. Almost everything had been almost exclusively going up for a year, especially since November 2020. BTC was at 56k, higher than it had ever been before, and would soon reach over 60k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, the situation is more complicated. The market in general has been going up and down a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; in the past year. Currently, the sentiment on here seems rather bearish, so I was curious: if we don&amp;#39;t just look at BTC but the general market, how much worse, if at all, does the situation look today? If someone started their crypto journey a year ago today and bought a coin, how likely is it they made a profit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I scraped historical data from a year ago today from Coinmarketcap and today&amp;#39;s prices. I looked at all coins that were in the top 200 a year ago and checked how many of them are up and how many of them are down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were 8 stablecoins in the top 200 back then, which of course did not really go up or down, so there are 192 remaining. Of these, &lt;strong&gt;48 (25%) increased in price since then&lt;/strong&gt;. LUNA (+756%), SOL (+481%), MATIC (+397%) and MANA (+395%) performed the best since then. &lt;strong&gt;22 coins (11%) at least doubled in this time frame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, of course, that means &lt;strong&gt;144 (75%) of all coins in the top 200 back then lost value. 83 (43%) of all coins lost more than half of their value and 35 (18%) lost more than 70%&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;#39;s not looking too great. The coins that performed the worst are CyberVein (-98%), ZKSpace (-96%) and  Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (-95%) - and I have never heard of either of them. From the slightly better known coins, the top losers are NEM, The Graph (both -84%) and SushiSwap (-83%). As a GRT hodler that hurts, even though I&amp;#39;m still up from the price I bought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does all of this mean? Well, not that much, but I guess it&amp;#39;s obvious that, for the first time in a while, we are pretty obviously in a downward trend and have been for a while.&lt;/strong&gt; Some would argue it is definitely a bear market (and using a &lt;a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp\"&gt;classic definition from other markets&lt;/a&gt; we absolutely are), some would probably define everything that isn&amp;#39;t a negative trend for multiple years, like 2018-2020, just temporary and not a real bear market. I have absolutely no idea what will happen next - crash, crabbing along or start of the next crazy bull run - but I thought this might interest some of you as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
