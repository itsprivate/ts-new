Half of them haven&amp;#39;t even figured that one out yet, but instead their minds were replaced with some commie&amp;#39;s thoughts onto a quick draft wiki page while boomers with PDST get reminded of &amp;quot;Prisoners Of War&amp;quot; everytime they hear POW. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof of this was the realization that 5 years ago, less than a million people signed a stand to denuclearize the world.   That will give you a clear picture about everyone&amp;#39;s wokeness as a whole, and they are STILL TALKING about crypto.  They actually make a point to stop crypto transactions with Russia more than preventing a Nuclear war.&lt;br/&gt;\n.\nHoly shit.   Indonesia&amp;#39;s religious sector just said Crypto was against their religious beliefs as the reason to stop it.  But God ..don&amp;#39;t stop the internet.  Nothing wrong with yanking it to P0rn0 right?   But bad ol crypto currency.      People actually think God said Yes to Internet but No to crypto. Like he&amp;#39;s some sort of disgruntled politician upset that is Banking Investments are stagnant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a load of shit.   No wonder why bible stories say God will come back to destroy the Earth. We are too stupid for him, I&amp;#39;d be pissed too if I were him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
