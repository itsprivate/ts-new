There was no one event you could point to and say “that’s the cause of the end”. Price just kept going steadily down and with every smaller relief rally, hope and interest started to diminish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m just saying this as someone who experienced this once before to consider the possibility that this run up could be in the rear view and have a strategy for both bull and bear markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: there doesn’t have to be one catastrophic event to go from bull to bear. Sometimes it just happens abruptly without any single culprit&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
