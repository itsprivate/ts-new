I’ve been putting all of my spare income into crypto for 2 years now and slowly funneling my life savings in too. Hard not to with these numbers. The plan is to sell off around 2025 and set up the life I’ve been working for since I was 15 years old. Nothing special. Just a nice little house on a modest amount of acreage where my dogs can play and my daughter can visit while she’s in college. Hopefully my grandkids can come play some day. I think with the current state of the market it should be absolutely killing it around that time. Fingers crossed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
