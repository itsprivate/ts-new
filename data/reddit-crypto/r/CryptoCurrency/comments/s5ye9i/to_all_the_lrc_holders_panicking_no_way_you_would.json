You most likely bought it because of the hype and best case scenario because you believe in the project. In that case you wouldn’t have to worry about anything anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t be upset about price action and it might help not looking at charts for a while. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; believe in the project and didn’t invest what you can’t afford to lose: just buy the dip and hodl.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
