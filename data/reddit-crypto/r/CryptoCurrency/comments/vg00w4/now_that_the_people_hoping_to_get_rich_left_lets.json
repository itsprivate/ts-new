No monthly fees, no depending on if the bank wants you or not, no paperwork requirements, no paying for bundle of services that you will never use, no predatory credit practices and so many other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagined people being able to transfer money with no boundaries. International money transfers can be such a pain in the ass and there all sorts of fees and random entities you have to trust in order to do it. Even if the money is yours you need a bank account in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagined people in countries with high inflation being able to have money that is stable and detached from the craziness in their countries. Venezuela comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish there existed some coin with some built in mechanism that discouraged speculation so the price would be more stable and poor people could put their money on it without the risk of all the price fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what other real life uses you see for Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
