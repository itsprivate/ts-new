I just got a scam email so I am sure others here did too from what looks like Coinbase.  First of all, &amp;quot;Confirmation billing account has been update&amp;quot; is not a sentence. The word is &amp;quot;updated&amp;quot;. The body of the email contains similar grammatical errors. Second,  I don&amp;#39;t receive a bill from Coinbase so I wouldn&amp;#39;t need to update anything.  They make money when I buy or sell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this may seem obvious to many of you, but some people here are new and might think these sort of scam emails are real. Do not click the link. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the real clear giveaway, it says to give them a call with any questions and lists a phone number (that probably is part of the scam and not a real Coinbase #). As if Coinbase customer service is sitting around waiting to help me ðŸ™„.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
