If anything, I am buying more as I have not invested more than I can afford to lose so I don&amp;#39;t care what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course nobody wants to lose money but you have to decide. Imagine you sell now and later this year we break 100k. I would rather lose all my money than not being invested once this happens. The risk of NOT holding is just too high in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto is the only chance to achieve financial freedom and escape the hamster wheel we are all stuck in. I am gladly taking the risk for this possibility. If the money is gone, nothing changes anyway and we keep hamster wheeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not financial advice as usual, only my personal opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
