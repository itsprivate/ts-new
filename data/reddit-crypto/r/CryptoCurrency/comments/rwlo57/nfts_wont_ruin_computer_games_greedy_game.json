If NFTs were in DnD they would be a lawful neutral force, they are not good or evil they are just a tool and being a transparent and open tool it makes them more easy to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anything NFTs should provide more consumer protection for digital game downloads than the present model of Microsoft being all like &amp;quot;trust me bra, we got this&amp;quot; until one day they just remove the game from the store and leave no public evidence that you ever owned it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I also 100% guarantee that game companies are going to use this to further monetise the market for pointless crap cosmetics and strip even more out of a game to sell back to the player later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But people shouldn&amp;#39;t hate the technology, that&amp;#39;s like hating the internet because game companies use the internet to download microtransactions, it really makes no sense. Hate the companies and hate the people buying their garbage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
