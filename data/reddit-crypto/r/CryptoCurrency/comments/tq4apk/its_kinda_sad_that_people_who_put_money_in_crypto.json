I buy crypto instead of buying expensive alcohol,  or a pack of cigarettes. I buy crypto instead of buying a $200 sneakers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish people realize that we invest in crypto cause we got some goals for which crypto is the only way. That&amp;#39;s why I refrain from talking about crypto with anyone. They won&amp;#39;t invest. First they&amp;#39;ll judge us, then they&amp;#39;ll burn in jealousy if we make money out of it or they&amp;#39;ll ask for us to teach them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This just piss me off, like alot. Yes there&amp;#39;s risk in buying crypto, atleast it&amp;#39;s better than burning money for ridiculous  things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
