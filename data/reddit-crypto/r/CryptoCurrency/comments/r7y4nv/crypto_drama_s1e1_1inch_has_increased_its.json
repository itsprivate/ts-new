Thanks for joining the CryptoDrama enjoy your Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Edit: The 1inch team has made an announcement about the issue:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The December 2021 1INCH token unlock occurred as planned, which led to an increase in the 1INCH circulation supply. The 1INCH circulation supply data on Coinmarketcap and on the 1inch Network&amp;#39;s official website are correct. The 1inch community can refer to these resources for up-to-date data on the 1INCH circulation supply. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 1inch Network has no control over the circulation of the 1INCH token on the secondary market and bears no responsibility for any market activities with the token. However, to minimize opportunities for market manipulations, the 1inch Network never revealed a specific roadmap or provided exact dates for token unlocks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The time marks on the charts on the website and in the 1INCH distribution blog post were never meant to specify exact unlock dates. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The exact meaning of “unlocked over a four-year period through December 30, 2024&amp;quot; is that an unlock could occur on any date of each given month of the token unlock schedule.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
