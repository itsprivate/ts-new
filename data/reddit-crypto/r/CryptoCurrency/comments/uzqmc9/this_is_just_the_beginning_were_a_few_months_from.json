Layoffs, interest rates, political and social strife, corruption, disease, death. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what to prepare for. Have a safety net of some kind. Do you have savings for if you or your partner(s) get laid off? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you do if the place you&amp;#39;re renting gets sold off to cover some landlord&amp;#39;s margin, and the new buyer raises your rents past what you can afford?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have skills and network and savings to survive if suddenly your luck goes worse for 3-6 months?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, that&amp;#39;s where to focus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn from the past. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. some of the biggest false rallies happen during downturns, so try to stick to whatever DCA/plan you have and try to avoid fomoing in more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: This was such a nice conversation about horrible things.
