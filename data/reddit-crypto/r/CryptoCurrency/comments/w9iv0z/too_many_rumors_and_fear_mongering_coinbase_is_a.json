This company is making money hand over fist. Here is snap shot of their revenues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/336ifr4iw4e91.png?width=2183&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e2b26e2d9b94623cb99a157cc1caa5b0dd0b2f25\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/336ifr4iw4e91.png?width=2183&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e2b26e2d9b94623cb99a157cc1caa5b0dd0b2f25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;revenue alone in 2021 is about 8 Billion and Gross profit 6.5 Billion.  Yes revenue is expected to drop but is due in part to the entire cryptomarket at large. In fact I argue that there is a some crazy opportunity here to make money in their stock when the crypto market get back on track but that is neither here or there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is coinbase has solid billion dollar revenue streams and does not lend or trade future contracts. Historically they have complied with SEC in almost every way and is publicly traded with solid documentations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can they go copout as well, of course, but unlikely. Should you move your coins?  I personally think to at least have a big portion in a non custodial is a good idea BUT has nothing to do with coinbase.  Honestly some folks are better off with assets in a trust worthy CEX.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
