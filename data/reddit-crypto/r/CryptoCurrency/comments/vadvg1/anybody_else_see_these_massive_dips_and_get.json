I DCA every week and my averages are looking awesome, even if my overall value is down over the past 6 months. When I first got into crypto I treaded a little too lightly and didn&amp;#39;t invest what I should have.

Barring a societal collapse from which we never recover, I look forward to some steep economic declines if it means I can buy up a lot of crypto for way less fiat. Have I completely lost it or is anyone else on the same page as me as far as this potentially being a huge buying opportunity? I don&amp;#39;t know about you boys, but I&amp;#39;m stacking up like a mad man right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
