The odds of winning in a gambling app is terribly low, even if it is disguised as fantasy sports. Some utterly shitty games like Rummy are supported on UPI.. but investing in crypto is blocked lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such decisions show that UPI can never be a real global settlement layer. If legit businesses like Coinbase can be kicked off at will, it is not a neutral settlement layer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RBI is a strong opponent of crypto and has hit out multiple times against crypto with latest attacks referencing outdated claims from 2013.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
