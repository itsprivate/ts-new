Worse yet even Russians creating fake donations to soak up the funds for their cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ONLY way I would donate is by sending it directly to someone you know of in Ukraine who needs it or can distribute it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do NOT let your guard down. Scammers will profit off of anything even this. Yes it is a new low.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
