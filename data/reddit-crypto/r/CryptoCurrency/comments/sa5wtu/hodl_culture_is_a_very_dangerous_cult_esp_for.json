NFA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am NOT encouraging you to sell at a loss. I am just asking you to rethink your strategy and evaluate whether every single coin in your portfolio deserves long-term HODL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will try to explain why you cannot always expect HODL to work in the long-term and why we should stop BLINDLY following this gold-standard consensus. Again DYOR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing wrong with HODLing BTC and ETH for the very long-term, BUT it&amp;#39;s much more complicated with &amp;quot;altcoins&amp;quot;... Let&amp;#39;s dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We hear HODL every day so much that we kinda forget there is another way of landing in profit in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I myself am a victim of the HODL bs (a blind believer) and I still have bags from 2017/2018 that have not managed to pump to prices I bought them at during the 2017 bull run and 2018 crash (yes even after I DCA&amp;#39;d those years). I HEDL for too long and didn&amp;#39;t take profit when I had to. Now I don&amp;#39;t want to sell them at a loss, but I don&amp;#39;t really believe they will ever reach their 2018 ATH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get real. &lt;strong&gt;HODLing does NOT work for every single coin out there&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter how strong the project is, the reality is, not everything will go up forever. With the exception of maybe BTC and ETH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot predict the market. A strong project can 100x overnight but then go back down 70% and never again see its previous all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with locking your profits. Don&amp;#39;t let anyone make you feel bad about it. Even if you lock your profits at 50%, you are still 50% up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be consistent. A couple of nice 2x trades, will get you to your first million a lot faster than chasing 1000x moonshots all the time and losing $100 here, $100 there, another $50 elsewhere. Consistency is key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine bag holding all these years, and not selling the following coins when they were trading at crazy high prices. You didn&amp;#39;t have to sell exactly at an all-time high (cause who can predict the top/bottom anyway). But my point is, you&amp;#39;d be better off in the long-term, if you sold these when they were pumping like crazy and locked your profits close to the ATH when you could (even 20% lower than the ATH would have done wonders to your portfolio). Once you lock your profits from altcoins that you can&amp;#39;t be sure of for the long-term, then you can funnel those profits into solid projects like BTC and ETH. Or hell, even staking your stable coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(prices are daily averages from CMC)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2018 ATH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2021 bull run performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;EOS&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$23&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$2.17&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t manage to break $14 last year&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;IOTA&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$5.69&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$0.7585&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$2.5 was the top&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;NEO&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$197&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$17.2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$120 was the top&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Compound&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$118.69&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$911 was the top&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;XRP (Ripple)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$3.84&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$0.57&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Struggled to break $1.8 (...since 2018)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;NANO&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$33&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~$13 was the top&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;TRON&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$0.22&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$0.055&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$0.16 was the top&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;XLM/Stellar&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$0.9381&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$0.1849&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;didn&amp;#39;t manage to break ~$0.7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Filecoin&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$18.58&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$237 ATH&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Monero&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$470&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$147&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$517&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The list of top 100 coins on CMC today is VERY different from the top 100 of 2017 and 2018.
