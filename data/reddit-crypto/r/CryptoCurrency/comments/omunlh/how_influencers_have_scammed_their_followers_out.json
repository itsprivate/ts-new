Still, let&#39;s get into this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Banksocial</strong> - Promoted by <strong>Faze Banks</strong> on May 27 after which it peaked at high of around $0.000015 and has since fallen to  $0.000000647. Another member, Faze Kay, was also involved (just as he will be in another scam).</li>\n<li><strong>MILF Token</strong> - Promoted by Twitch streamer Adinross (4.4m followers). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_V4qr51Mhw&amp;t=437s\">Clip Here.</a> Three weeks later he then went on to say he only did it <a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/TriangularAssiduousDumplingsDancingBaby-wDwTkDBIEZ-KJR3V\">for the money</a> and &quot;hoped&quot; none of his fans bought into it.  If one of Ross&#39; fans invested $100 in MILF Token during his stream, they would have approximately $5.80 today. </li>\n<li><strong>Titscoin</strong> -  On April 30, Tana Mongeau posted a video to her Instagram Stories telling people how her stake in this coin bought her a Rollsroyce and that they should get theirs now. If you invested $100 on the day Mongeau claimed her Titscoin investment resulted in the purchase of a Rolls Royce, you would have approximately $0.0000000000000000001664 today. Faze Kay also promoted this coin.</li>\n<li><strong>Save The Kids Token</strong> - This has made headlines recently and guess who was involved? You&#39;re right Faze Kay. He along with other members of the <strong>Faze clan</strong> and people like <strong>RiceGum</strong> promoted the launch of this token acting as &quot;ambassadors&quot;. Save the Kids hit as high as $0.04 on launch day. Just hours after that high, it tanked. If you invested $100 in Save the Kids on launch day, it would be worth around $3.39 today. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mark Cuban <a href=\"https://blogmaverick.com/2021/06/13/the-brilliance-of-yield-farming-liquidity-providing-and-valuing-crypto-projects/\">promoting</a> TITAN. It fell from an ATH of $65 to now somewhere near $0.0000008907 (edit: users have said this wasn’t really a scam)</li>\n<li>Jake Paul Among others promoting scam coins. <a href=\"https://centennialbeauty.com/influencers-promoting-cryptocurrency/\">Link.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/influencers-altcoin-scams\">Another list of examples</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is honestly way too many of these influencers who don&#39;t care about consequences as long as they get their money. <strong>Remember their names, remember their faces</strong>, we may be bearish now but as soon as things change, they&#39;ll be back.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
