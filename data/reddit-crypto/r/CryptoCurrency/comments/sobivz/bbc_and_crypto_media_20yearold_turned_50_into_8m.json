  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a wholesome story going around by the BBC today, echoed by some crypto &amp;quot;media&amp;quot; about a young crypto millionaire that turned $50 into millions within months trading crypto. Okay, this sound somewhat unbelievable, but there&amp;#39;s more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They report, he is giving back to the community and &amp;quot;A cryptocurrency he set up to support charity has already seen more than ¬£200,000 spent on causes, and he is looking to use further funds raised by his currency to realise his foodbank plans for his home town of Birmingham.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is: that token shut down in October, as a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimwaterson/status/1491361991541538817\"&gt;Twitter user&lt;/a&gt; found out through a short search. If you look at their &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Orfano/\"&gt;subreddit&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;#39;s dead and people don&amp;#39;t seem very happy - it seemingly was a scam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the fuck? I know crypto reporting in mainstream media is often bad, and crypto media is always awful, but how can such a big medium publish such a story without the most basic research?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: seems like the BBC article was taken down! You can find an archived version &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sobivz/bbc_and_crypto_media_20yearold_turned_50_into_8m/hw7ofvc/\"&gt;in my reply here&lt;/a&gt; (I don&amp;#39;t want to link it directly as my post couldn&amp;#39;t be posted with the link originally)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
