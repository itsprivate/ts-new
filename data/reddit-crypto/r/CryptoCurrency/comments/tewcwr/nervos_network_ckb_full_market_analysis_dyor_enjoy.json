Due to the length (24 pages) and complexity of the report, you can see here only the summary with the conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wvnb0j4cdln81.png?width=802&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b5b8b20266bd091f0486174dbd6310913213d01\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/wvnb0j4cdln81.png?width=802&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b5b8b20266bd091f0486174dbd6310913213d01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The full report is available at &lt;a href=\"https://runus.tech/reports/nervos_network_report.pdf\"&gt;https://runus.tech/reports/nervos_network_report.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in seeing more reports, you can find us at &lt;a href=\"https://nn.reddit.com/r/runus/\"&gt;r/runus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is appreciated! This is our second analysis and we have a lot of stuff to learn so we can create better reports. We do not favor any project and we let the community vote on what project shall be analyzed next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer!: &lt;strong&gt;HODL meter&lt;/strong&gt; has little correlation with the confidence meters. The &lt;strong&gt;confidence meters&lt;/strong&gt; as you will see in the report are analyzing the project from a non-investment perspective to check if we shall trust the project and its &amp;quot;story&amp;quot;. The HODL meter takes into consideration the current global monetary policy, the current market trend in different markets, macroeconomic situation worldwide, and consumer perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
