A simplified version of this could be represented by the cash flow from Bitcoin -&gt; Ethereum -&gt; Altcoins.</p>\n\n<p>It is undoubtedly true that Bitcoin is in a second-peak cycle, recently just hitting a new all-time high. However, historically with such moves, will a cumulative, follow-up alt-season occur soon after. Timelines are uncertain due to each cryptocurrency&#39;s relative size and distribution, but a major alt-season is prophesied to occur anywhere from a few weeks to months. Combined with the reasoning of this prediction, this post will attempt to further explain the macroeconomics behind alt-seasons. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s recommended to read a case-study summary of the most recent May alt-season to get caught up: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o20ofs/the_economics_behind_altseasons_a_case_study_of/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o20ofs/the_economics_behind_altseasons_a_case_study_of/</a>  </p>\n\n<h1>WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR AN ALT-SEASON</h1>\n\n<p>Bitcoin needs a strong, upwards rally that accumulates momentum, enough to sustain a divergence of total crypto market cap v. Bitcoin. In layman&#39;s terms, this means a strong Bitcoin that holds its price very well, long enough for alt-season to begin anywhere from a few weeks to months later, dependant on each cryptocurrency&#39;s relative size.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Case Study #1</strong></p>\n\n<p>As demonstrated in Figure 1, where Bitcoin&#39;s price trend diverges from the rest of the crypto market cap, which will now be referred to as &#39;Market&#39;, causes a power vacuum of cash flow that causes an alt-season. The effects of this initial alt-season are demonstrated in Figure 2 with Ethereum&#39;s valuation, and Figure 3 with Cardano&#39;s valuation. Needless to say, the effects of divergence and subsequent power-vacuum, and alt-season are quite obvious once modelled under the right circumstances. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zj05zwe4dwu71.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc9edfa39c789a4c8be053c6219815bcce5bd024\">Figure 1, a graph demonstrating the trend divergence between Bitcoin (in orange) and total crypto market cap (in green/ red)</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5b5agzkpfwu71.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fcb8db24361929a8660b2d1ad4a84912ea3e6b7\">Figure 2, a graph demonstrating Ethereum&#39;s reaction to a Bitcoin v. Market divergence. Note that this is a percentage-based graph, but during this time, Ethereum put a 520&#37; appreciation within 189 days of the divergence. The blue verticle line indicates the start of major divergence. </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/spqs5cu3gwu71.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6649df930dc0e85d12a5c544474012925fc25389\">Figure 3, a graph demonstrating Cardano&#39;s (ADA) reaction to a Bitcoin v. Market divergence. Note the delayed parabolic move, and how Cardano did not immediately go nuts. This is due to the simplified cash flow model of BTC -&gt; ETH -&gt; Alt-coins, denoting that alts like Cardano would get their cash influx much later than bigger coins.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Case Study #2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another, more recent example of alt-seasons can be retrieved from the May alt-coin season. As demonstrated in Figure 4, a massive divergence was created from Bitcoin&#39;s residual market momentum. Figure 5 portrays Ethereum&#39;s reaction to the divergence. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mhg4gm1qhwu71.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69f2f8b87fc861219a9425d01151f03262d430ea\">Figure 4, an in-depth comparison of the Market (in green/red) v. Bitcoin (in orange). Note the even stronger divergence caused by the cumulative momentum carried by the initial Bitcoin rally to 64k USD. </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/byya01h6iwu71.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcb9478682d0167a3fea4ee536e114b2f121f68\"> Figure 5, a depiction of Ethereum&#39;s pump as a result of the alt-coin season caused by the Market v. Bitcoin divergence. Please note this chart is on a percentage-based scale, but within the timeframe of the most recent divergence, caused a massive 200&#37; appreciation by Ethereum.  </a></p>\n\n<h1>CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF A DIVERGENCE, AND PREDICTIONS</h1>\n\n<p>Due to Bitcoin&#39;s second leg of the bull-run to a new all-time high, there seems to be another divergence forming, as demonstrated in Figure 6 and insinuated by Bitcoin&#39;s current price trend. As a result, as you could&#39;ve already guessed, Ethereum is already tagging along, just recently hitting a close high of 4.4k USD, as demonstrated in Figure 7. Of course, other altcoins like Cardano, who lie closer to the bottom of the simplified cash-flow sequence of BTC -&gt; ETH -&gt; Alt-coins, are lying dormant, if not, even going down, as demonstrated in Figure 8! But don&#39;t worry, with time, even your pet project of an alt-coin will rise up. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/adyyswvujwu71.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b67e387b49b52d4b0412516abae9b227c838d0c6\">Figure 6, a new divergence forming is portrayed between the Market (in green/ red) and Bitcoin (in orange), represented in a percentage scaled graph.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a52wd95jkwu71.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=266e79a07895fe9c0a86b6e5ef8d88a5a81da97c\">Figure 7, Ethereum&#39;s price shown in blue attempting to catch up with Bitcoin, in the process, hitting a close all-time high of 4.4k USD. </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yy7uf4eblwu71.png?width=1485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbd1020c75aad8dab517ae2fd5afd620013866c4\">Figure 8, Cardano&#39;s price on a percentage scale graph, shown to be almost &#39;dying&#39; as it patiently waits for the alt-season to trickle down the sequence. </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>TO CONCLUDE</h1>\n\n<p>Another alt-season is almost set in stone to happen, and depending on your cryptocurrency&#39;s relative size, is to happen from within a few weeks to months, excluding Ethereum of course, which I personally do not consider as an alt-coin. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this due diligence helped clear up all the recent spewed-out copypasta of how cash-flow works in the cryptocurrency space. Understanding such variables and events can be both extremely entertaining and profitable, and as a result, are one of the essential skill-sets of any investor out there.
