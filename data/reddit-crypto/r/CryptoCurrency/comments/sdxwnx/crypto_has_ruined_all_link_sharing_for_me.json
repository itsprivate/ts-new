I&amp;#39;m serious. If I see the title in the link, I&amp;#39;ll google it myself. I get so many scam texts and automated calls; it&amp;#39;s insane! I delete everything immediately without opening it or listening to it. It&amp;#39;s crazy that there are so many people out there, seemingly living in this dark crypto world of theft and fraud; I feel like there&amp;#39;s more now than ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sad thing about it, is that it has diminished my trust in most everyone. As a result, I approach all conversations cautiously, always thinking there&amp;#39;s an angle to mislead. It sucks because I know there are good people out there, who really want to engage genuinely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else feel this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I appreciate all of the positive feedback from everyone that can relate. As for the negative &amp;quot;, you need a psychiatrist, go touch grass, take a break&amp;quot; feedback; this sub is a place to foster discussion about the world of crypto, and this is an aspect of that world. I understand that grifters and scammers have been around since the beginning of time, but I think it has become exponentially worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
