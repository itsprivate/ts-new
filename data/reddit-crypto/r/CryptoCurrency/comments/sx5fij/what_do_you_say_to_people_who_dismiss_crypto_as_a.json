This is mainly because there are absolutely aspects of crypto investing that give off Ponzi vibes to the uninitiated - just look at all those rugged tokens, even the DAO&amp;#39;s that make headlines because of sudden price plummets etc. And no doubt the 2017ish Bitcoin craze where thousands of people bought the top before a very cold winter is still fresh in people&amp;#39;s minds, alongside BTC&amp;#39;s current price situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is: how do you guys address the common accusation that we&amp;#39;re all just crabs trying to claw our way to the tippy-top of a grand digital ponzi? Many thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; To those saying &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot;, I appreciate the pragmaticism - but I&amp;#39;m after retorts that address the core scepticisms that a lot of people display towards crypto. Either way, I always ask myself &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;am I still early??&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I wonder if the internet&amp;#39;s early days were met with a similar response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
