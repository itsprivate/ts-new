And move it back onto the <a href=\"https://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> Exchange.</p>\n\n<p>I put a sell order for my Rari at 80$ and it sold. As of recent I have seen some insane arbitrage opportunities and made money off of them. Like RLC just the other day.</p>\n\n<p>So I made 4000 something on the first go. I did it again but this time purchased 150 Rari. Sent it on over to <a href=\"https://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> and did the same thing. This time the Bot or Person buying Purchased my Rari for 899$ each on just a market sell not even a limit sell.</p>\n\n<p>So I had 130,000 in USDT which I Immediately moved into Eth and then move to my Metamask wallet.</p>\n\n<p>I told my GF if I made anything big I would be out so I cashed out asap thinking I had done it. Now <a href=\"https://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> has e-mailed me asking for 40 ETH Back. Mind you I bought the ETH at 3200$ each and they are now 4200$ each.</p>\n\n<p>It took them like 24 hours before they even contacted me. And its taken them roughly 5 days between each email of me asking questions.</p>\n\n<p>They have emailed me about returning it to reopen my exchange account. But I couldn&#39;t care less about my <a href=\"https://crypto.com/\">Crypto.com</a> exchange account now.....</p>\n\n<p>Remove the ETH scan. Sorry folks I don&#39;t want you to see my wallet of bad trades and shit coins.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I will be posted updates in the comments below or in here, as things progress,</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I have contacted a lawyer and so far so good. Thank you everyone for your comments.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I missed so many good pumps this year by being to much of a pussy to pull the trigger.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I had opportunities to buy doge at .0002, I had 10 Bitcoin on a hard drive that is now in a landfill somewhere. So this was a huge spark of joy for me.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also I don&#39;t have too delete the post, it contains information which they already have. And to buy and sell Crypto in Canada you have to supply your personal information. So they would be able to identify me regardless.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
