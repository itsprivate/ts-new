  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music and crypto is definitely a new use case. Let&amp;#39;s take a look at it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Snoop talks about how all music is influenced by labels and all sound the same. The music industry, as you can imagine, is extremely predatory for young artists and even stars. Apparently even Taylor Swift is having problems getting back her master sountracks. He and his son see crypto as a way to give artists back their freedom and creativity without being influenced by big labels. Pretty freakin awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Snoop also talks about using his tracks without worrying about copyrights. With all this Youtube copystriking bullshit stifling content creators, its refreshing to see us going back to the golden days of content creation with crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, we heard some dope shit. Somebody took one of my vocals from a rap song that I did on the mixtape and made a whole fucking EDM song out of it. That shit banging. So I&amp;#39;m anxious to hear what what, these you know content creators are going to do with my vocals with the music with the songs because once you get it you can do whatever the fuck you want to do with it. That&amp;#39;s what I love about this shit. There&amp;#39;s no rules and regulations you can make it yours. You can flip it, dip it. You know how much it costs to get me on the verse?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know you don&amp;#39;t, but anyway they get it on the House.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Link to interview:&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1511402568420929538\"&gt;https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1511402568420929538&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: FFS mispelled dee o double gee&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
