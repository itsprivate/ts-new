You think 20 years from now some 20 to 30 year old dudes and dudettes are gonna think you&#39;re a genius for owning cryptos? Maybe some of them will actually think that way. The vast majority, however, will hate your guts. What kind of genius was that, they say, that someone loaded up on all &#39;undervalued&#39; ETHs and BTCs back in the Roaring 20s and now they&#39;re the top 1%? Fucking Millenials and fucking Gen Zs are ruining the economy. Fuck these old fucks.</p>\n\n<p>When crypto becomes big, ancient wallets from 2017 and 2020 will be akin to owning prime real estate assets in today&#39;s age. If you managed to hodl this long and survived all the way till 2040s, dear reader, then you can look back at this post and tell yourself that you have made it. Enjoy your wealth. You&#39;ll be hated for it. Your family will love you for it. Your children will either: a/ love you for it and help you build wealth or b/ they will sit on their asses all day playing Metaverse Pornos and spending your cryptos to simp for digital chicks. Younger people will think you ruined the economy by hoarding too much cryptos and they&#39;ll tell you to pay more taxes.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s okay. You can wipe your tears on those dollar bills. And you can keep doing what you love. Just know that it&#39;s impossible to please everyone. But even if just 1 of you make money from crypto, that is already 1 future family not ending up in either poverty or as corporate drone-slaves. And that&#39;s good.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: this post assumes you&#39;ll all have families, but since we&#39;re all redditors, let&#39;s be realistic eh?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
