So I wanted to share my process to help out other newbies and potentially help give ideas to implement a similar process.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>At first, I wanted to watch every new coin being made, reality is you&#39;re really limited to the platform you use. I&#39;m on KuCoin so I&#39;ve begun watching every new coin that&#39;s listed there. Whatever platform you&#39;re on that&#39;s where you&#39;ll want to check what&#39;s newly listed daily. This is also nice because it&#39;s a filter, I know at least the coins making it onto KuCoin have had to prove themselves in some form.</li>\n<li>Next, look at market cap, anything less than 30m is ripe but if the fully diluted market cap is insane like 2 billion it&#39;s a dud imo, there&#39;s too many locked coins soon to release working against price appreciation. So, ideally less than 30 million market cap and less than 250 million fully diluted. Now we&#39;ve found a coin that&#39;s small but passed through KuCoin and has potential. Time to research it!</li>\n<li>Finally, check to see if it&#39;s a coin that&#39;s actually growing in popularity. Look at Google trends for the name, check the growth rate of its subreddit, how active is their subreddit and how many members online. Find YouTube videos and also learn more about the coin. I want something that has substance to it, meaning it&#39;s an upcoming game, exchange, platform, service, not just a transfer of wealth but has utility.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is what am doing, feel it identifies certified exchange approved coins, with big growth potential, and has noise being made/growing fanbase. Then just put in a couple bucks and aim to sell 50% after 5x-10x, and keep the rest to go long for potential crazy moonshot.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
