Part of the risk and excitement of being in the crypt. If you haven’t been here long (most people here have got into the crypt the last 4 months) this is part of the game and likely will be for a time. This is good as this also gives the gainz over time more than traditional markets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The market is more mature than years gone by but the volatility is still there albeit less pronounced eg 80% drop in 2hrs - keep it simple (dont over trade)and HODL in what you believe in and may the gwei be with you….&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS this is something that has been part of crypto since the early days that hardens one to a new level of apathy and diamond hands the real test comes in when suicide lines come in at the post 30% drops to 80% drops. Again only have skin in the game in what you believe and make sure it’s quality bags!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
