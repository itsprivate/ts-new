  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings, here are some tried and proven methods on how to talk to people in your life who know you are holding crypto during a bear market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Feign ignorance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: In a facetime call with your father and he asks you how &amp;quot;that bitmoney of yours is doing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response: &amp;quot;Bitmoney? Haha (fake laughter) you mean &lt;em&gt;bitcoin&lt;/em&gt; dad. I was just joking about getting into it. What is it even?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Lie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: Your mother texts you asking what you did with Grandpa&amp;#39;s inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response: &amp;quot;Oh (stalling language to give you more time to assemble your thoughts), I put it into a high-yield savings account. Why? Will you be needing it in about 9-10 months time?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Redirect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: You leave your desk for a cup of coffee and your co-worker shouts &amp;quot;Hey! It&amp;#39;s Mr. Funny-Money!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response: &amp;quot;Hey! It&amp;#39;s Mr. Give-his-wife-a-black-eye-so-she-leaves-with-the-kids!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: Your wife is asking what happened to the money for the trip to Italy you were saving up for anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response: &amp;quot;Hang on I need to take a piss (do not go to the bathroom, but instead leave the house and run to a neighboring city and register under a new identity)&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Hide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: Your brother-in-law has tracked you down under your new identity of &amp;quot;Janice Maria Juan Hernandez&amp;quot; a trans-sexual erotic dancer, and phones you on your cell-phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response: Do not pick up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Gas-light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: Your boss is concerned about you because she noticed you stopped talking about cryptocurrency even though you were raving all about it throughout 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response: &amp;quot;What? You were the one telling me about it. Don&amp;#39;t you remember &amp;#39;HODL, HODL&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;to the moon!&amp;#39;? You were saying it all the time! (surreptitiously place your &amp;#39;No sell &amp;#39;til LAMBO&amp;#39; mug on her desk) Look! Remember parading this around last summer?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Talk sense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: Some drunk walks up to you on the street and says &amp;quot;Cryptocurrencies are a fucking fraud man! I put all my savings into them and lost everything!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response: &amp;quot;Listen you degenerate urchin (clinch to deflect his attack), a bear market is a natural process of any economic environment (duck a punch). If you can&amp;#39;t handle the bear and hold, you don&amp;#39;t deserve the bull&amp;#39;s gold (parry his knife with your child).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Admit that maybe you are over-leveraged and that ultimately your life is more important than money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: The police are speaking to you over a loudspeaker as you stand on the rooftop of your 12 floor office building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll come down for a crunch wrap supreme, chicken quesadilla, loaded fries, and a case of beer. NO CILANTRO. I SWEAR I&amp;#39;LL JUMP IF YOU SCREW THIS UP.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With these steps in mind, hopefully you can stall long enough until your portfolio recovers and you can face your friends/relatives/parole officers with a straight face again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: fixed some spelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
