Therefore, they ask questions like: &quot;what happens to my coins if I delete my wallet? How can I move my voins to my new PC etc.</p>\n\n<p>I find it necessary to stress the follwing fact:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>But where are my coins?</h1>\n\n<p>Coins are &quot;stored&quot; in the blockchain. The blockchain is a really long list of every transaction between (coin) adresses. Since all transactions are known, and adresses are public, the amount of coins at a given adress is known, too.</p>\n\n<p>Think of a coin adress as a letterbox made of (indestructable) glass: everybody can see how much is inside, everybody can stuff coins into it, but <strong>only the person(s) with the private key can take something out.</strong></p>\n\n<h1>But what does a wallet do?</h1>\n\n<p>The most important feature of a wallet is to (securely) hold the (private) keys to the corresponding adresses on the blockchain. Therefore it allows you to access (sent/spent) your coins. <strong>Think of it like a big keychain.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To generate keys and adresses your wallet uses a <strong>seed phrase of 12 (or 24) english words</strong>. Entering the same seed phrase always generates the same keys/adresses. Setting up a new wallet starts with a random seed phrase.</p>\n\n<h1>Questions?</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How do I move my coins between devices/different wallet software? -&gt; <em>You just enter your current seed phrase into the new software/ the same software on another device.</em></li>\n<li>So do I lose my coins if I delete my wallet? -&gt; <em>No, since they are still in the blockchain. Without a wallet you are not able to do anything with your coins, though</em></li>\n<li>This means I can have the same wallet on different devices (i.e. pc/tablet/phone)? -&gt; <em>Yes. Be aware, that you have to keep all those devices secure.</em></li>\n<li>So if lose my seed phrase, my coins are gone? -&gt; <em>Your wallet will show you your seed phrase, so you are good as long as it is still installed. If you neither have your wallet or your seed phrase - then yes, nobody can access them anymore.</em></li>\n<li>Does that mean that anybody who knows my seed phrase can move my coins? -&gt; <em>Yes!!</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>TLDR? [edit]</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>coins are stored at adresses on the blockchain,  not in a wallet</li>\n<li>a wallet gives you access to your blockchain adresses</li>\n<li>the whole access thing is &quot;compressed&quot; in a 12 (or 24) words seed phrase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>protect your seed phrase!</li>\n<li>don&#39;t lose your seed phrase!!</li>\n<li>everybody who asks for your seed phrase is a scammer!!!</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
