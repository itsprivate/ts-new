Cheers to the team for all your work and contributions to this space!</p>\n\n<h1>The symbol for Ξther is Ξ</h1>\n\n<p>The Ξther symbol ( <strong>Ξ</strong> ) is the uppercase of &#39;<strong>Xi</strong>&#39; (lowercase <strong>ξ</strong>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Xi is the 14th letter of the Greek alphabet. It is pronounced in Modern Greek, and generally /ˈzaɪ/ or /ˈsaɪ/ in English. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 60 (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_(letter\">source</a>)).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first discussion I found as one of the first posts in their subreddit (reddit won&#39;t allow me to link it). I&#39;m not sure whether this led to the actualization of the symbol, or even if it is the official symbol.</p>\n\n<h1>We can thank Blizzard&#39;s centralized management for  Ξthereum</h1>\n\n<p>Vitalik&#39;s interest in cryptocurrencies and decentralized systems as a whole bloomed back in his World of Warcraft playing days. To this he says, &quot;one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock&#39;s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He then went on to discover Bitcoin and explore the space, leading to creation of Ξthereum. Or at least that&#39;s the &#39;story&#39; behind it. Recently, he clarified in a reddit post that &quot;it was a joke. Or rather, that experience with WoW that I had was 100% real, but the idea that the WoW experience specifically led to a decade-long bloodlust against centralization is a joke.&quot; Special thanks to <a href=\"/u/ec265\">u/ec265</a> for this note.</p>\n\n<h1>Ξthereum was a crowdfunded project</h1>\n\n<p>When Vitalik had the idea of Ξthereum he did not have enough resources to make his idea a reality. ICOs weren&#39;t really a thing back in 2013 so instead he turned to group funding to get capital for the project. His project was successful in online public sale in July-August 2014. The program was completed and delivered by July 30, 2015. The rest is history!</p>\n\n<h1>Ξthereum is not the unit of cryptocurrency; Ξther is</h1>\n\n<p>Ξthereum is the platform and <em>Ξther</em> is the currency so instead of saying something like, &quot;I want to purchase 1 Ξthereum,&quot; or &quot;I bought Ξthereum&quot;; the correct way to say it is, &quot;I want to purchase 1 Ξther&quot; or &quot;I bought Ξther.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This is obvious to most in the Ξthereum community but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s common knowledge in general crypto forums like this subreddit.</p>\n\n<h1>Ξthereum&#39;s ticker could have been ETR (or even XET)</h1>\n\n<p>In 2014, Vitalik posted a topic on the Ξthereum forum, &quot;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140122191222/http://forum.ethereum.org/index.php?p=/discussion/7/eth-vs-etr\">ETH or ETR</a>&quot;. The topic was about the abbreviation or ticker they were going to adopt moving forward. It could&#39;ve even been &#39;XET&#39; as one user, Mike says, &quot;or ISO standards, XET might be better if it is still available. Non national currencies like XAU - gold, XAG - silver, XRP - Ripple, begin with X.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The argument for ETR was so that it better reflects the currency name, Ξther. In the end, I think this last comment sold the deal, &quot;ETH rolls off the tongue more naturally, as with the sound in breath ( the first syllable in Ξthereum) and as such is more comfortable and organic than ETR&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s it! Five facts about Ξthereum. I hope you learned a thing or two, I certainly did. Special thanks to the Wayback Machine, it&#39;s such a gift for us legacy explorers.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>* This post is a repost of an earlier version that got deleted due to cursed limitations on &quot;your post has been removed because there are already 4 posts about Ξthereum in the top 50.&quot; Hence, the use of &quot;Ξ&quot; instead of &quot;E&quot;.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
