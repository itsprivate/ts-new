Rather, a small number of  the most unique and competitive  blockchains will dominate and rise to  the top, likely culminating into a top 3 or 4. This is a very common  trend in numerous markets such as grocery chains, energy,  telecommunications, computers and more, with  blockchains appearing to  follow suit as well.</p>\n\n<p>Cardano  is a  cryptocurrency project that aims to be the go to platform for smart  contract development in the blockchain space. To achieve this ambitious  goal it tries to solve the following challenges which are major issues  currently:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Scalability</li>\n<li>Smart contract security</li>\n<li>Sustainability through a protocol DAO which enables decentralized ecosystem self-funding</li>\n<li>An environmentally friendly consensus mechanism (Proof of Stake)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Cardano   follows a scientific approach where research is performed in  collaboration with multiple universities around the world thereby coming  out with state of the art advances in the field.   This research-based  approach provides Cardano countless benefits over its competitors,  however one of the clear tradeoffs has been it’s  time to market once  the research has been complete.</p>\n\n<p>Cardano   was the first chain to design and publish a provably secure solution  to Proof of Stake which culminated in the release of the Ouroboros  Protocol paper back in 2017. Since then the core developers have been   hard at work bringing the protocol into reality, with Proof of Stake   officially live and fully implemented on Cardano mainnet today. Users  are able to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Freely create stakepools</li>\n<li>Delegate to stakepools in a user friendly manner without losing custody of their funds</li>\n<li>Receive rewards for block creation / delegation</li>\n<li>Instantly move their funds at any time (no multi day lock such as in other chains)</li>\n<li>Mint / Burn tokens (which are considered native rather than built on top of a smart contract standard like ERC-20)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus  users have a full fledged PoS system at their disposal which  overcomes  many of the usability pitfalls other PoS chains struggle  with. Besides  solving PoS, Cardano also has a whole host of further  upgrades coming   up  including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plutus  (Smart contracts = Goguen done in Q3 &#39;21, major dApps (DEXes,  borrow&amp;lending under audits to be deployed soon in Q4/Q1 &#39;22, fun  smart contract for NFT marketplaces for spacebudz and deadpxlz  (pxlz.org) already functional and kicking ass)</li>\n<li>Hydra (scalability using state channels)</li>\n<li>Voltaire (On-chain voting)</li>\n<li>And more farther out in the pipeline</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since  the launch of Cardano mainnet in 2017, the network has gained a  significant amount of user interest. Cardano currently is one of the top   crypto projects in terms of marketcap (#6 at 50B+ $) and has over 3100  stakepools, making it one of the most decentralized blockchains.</p>\n\n<p>IOG  (one of the entities behind Cardano) has closed multiple partnerships  with governments around the  world;   The Ethiopian partnership  will   bring  5 million students across 3,500 schools to Cardano by  providing    decentralized IDs and the storage of educational records (<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/from-paper-to-cardano-blockchain-iohk-in-ethiopia\">https://www.coindesk.com/from-paper-to-cardano-blockchain-iohk-in-ethiopia</a>). Partnerships like this are a staple of the Cardano ecosystem, and signal a strong future for Cardano globally.</p>\n\n<p>When  looking at competitors, there are constant debates around Proof of Work   (PoW) vs Proof of Stake(PoS), yet rarely is any focus put on the   top  of  UTXO-model vs Account-based model which are at the foundation of    every  blockchain ledger. In many ways the latter topic is more    important than  the former for a smart contract platform, because it    dictates the  long-term viability of everything from scaling, security,    to formal  verification. A useful analogy to understand the difference    is to  imagine that a UTXO behaves the same way as dollar bills work,   wherein  you will receive change back because you over pay with an    indivisible  bill. In the Account-based model on the other hand, you    always transfer  the exact amount the same way that you do with bank    transfers. The  latter may seem more efficient by default, however it    has numerous  unexpected consequences which make a significant    difference.</p>\n\n<p>The  Account-based  model is used by the majority of current smart contract  platforms,  primarily due to the fact that it is simpler  to comprehend  when  designing and launching the smart contract layer of  the blockchain as  it exposes global state to every contract at any time.  As any   programmer knows, global state is dangerous and severely limits  the    ability of programs to parallelize/scale, and this similarly maps  onto   the blockchain context as well.</p>\n\n<p>This   global-access paradigm of the Account-based is going to be severely   limited with the introduction of sharding  where each shard will be  distinct and separate from one another,  meaning  much  of the original  benefits will be swept away in pursuit of  building  a  system that  actually scales. This means that the way that  protocols  are  designed  will begin moving towards how the UTXO-model  works, yet   carrying  along all of the previous baggage from choosing  Account-based   in the  first place.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, what  sets  Cardano apart is its self-sustainable mechanism for supporting   ecosystem growth: a decentralized DAO called Catalyst. This  DAO allows  community projects to be funded by a decentralized treasury (over 1B $  right now for funding) which is  managed by the users of the network.  Each ADA a user holds counts as a  single vote, meaning that the users  of the system decide  the  future  development of the ecosystem. This  brings the incentives in  alignment  and as such is one of the first  successful self-funding  mechanisms on a  large L1 blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>Sources:  <a href=\"https://medium.com/dcspark/why-cardano-f9c9a0db9d01\">https://medium.com/dcspark/why-cardano-f9c9a0db9d01</a></p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: turns out this is not &quot;shit on ADA&quot; post... My bad! I&#39;ll try to FUD better next time! I promise!</p>\n\n<p>Also remember kids, Ethereum had nothing to show for until 2018, that&#39;s about 2-3 years since its launch: see <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1xgwo/welcome_to_q4_of_2017_its_been_over_2_years_and/\">https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1xgwo/welcome_to_q4_of_2017_its_been_over_2_years_and/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
