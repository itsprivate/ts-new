Some of you have given some amazing feedback a while ago and we&amp;#39;re doing our best to implement it into the platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now the logic, database and all the other backend bits are pretty much done (still largely untested though).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re now working on finishing the front end and it looks like we might be ready for closed beta by the end of April!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The interface might still change up until then but here are some sneak previews:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k3lt9ffwz4n81.png?width=1181&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7d8542ad371bd21c9dbaa990d3506bc25d1ddfe6\"&gt;Trades dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8z0dcz5wz4n81.png?width=702&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1c095a6f30ee1b8073e16e75e930d7c69a7fdfe9\"&gt;Detailed bot configs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tool would allow you to create custom signals by combining a multitude of sources (indicators, volatility and even social media analysis in the future).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re also planning to add copytrading in the future where you can just simply copy a profitable bot and run it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join us at &lt;a href=\"/r/aesirofficial\"&gt;/r/aesirofficial&lt;/a&gt; for more updates and to join the closed beta&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
