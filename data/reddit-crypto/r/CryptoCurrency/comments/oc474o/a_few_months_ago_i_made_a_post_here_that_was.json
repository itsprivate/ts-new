  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone. A few months ago I posted how I made a set of forms to provide your spouse or loved one specific instructions to access your accounts if something happened to you. </p>\n\n<p>With cryptocurrency gaining popularity at a fast rate, I realized that if something were to happen to myself or anyone holding crypto, if their spouse or loved one didn&#39;t know how to access their accounts, their holdings are as good as gone.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve created a website and an Etsy shop with downloadable PDFs where you fill out all of your Exchange and Broker information. It&#39;s a form of protection for a a worst case scenario. The website is now up and running at <a href=\"http://www.organizersmadesimple.com\">www.organizersmadesimple.com</a></p>\n\n<p>The Etsy shop is at <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/shop/OrganizersMadeSimple\">www.etsy.com/shop/OrganizersMadeSimple</a> and the direct link to these forms is at <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/980316712/cryptocurrency-exchange-and-broker\">https://www.etsy.com/listing/980316712/cryptocurrency-exchange-and-broker</a></p>\n\n<p>The reason I created it is because a few years ago I almost died from a pulmonary embolism and my wife had no idea how to access my accounts. I don&#39;t want my crypto and money tied up for eternity where god forbid my wife wasn&#39;t able to access it.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone is having financial hardships, email me requesting a copy on my website and I&#39;ll do my best to send you the PDFs at no charge, as long as it&#39;sa reasonable amount of requests. All I ask is that if you want to buy it and can afford to make the purchase, I appreciate it. I put a lot of effort into the site and the forms the past few months. I priced them at $4.99 to make it as affordable as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A lot of the forms besides crypto have both a fillable and non fillable version, but all of the cryptocurrency forms have to be hand written for your protection.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I hope this is useful because it definitely is for me. My wife who knows nothing about crypto can easily follow along. Hopefully it never comes to that but you never know.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I mentioned in the comments that I work overnight so I have to get some sleep now. I can&#39;t thank you all enough for the support. I truly mean that. I already received an order from someone here. It&#39;s appreciated. I hope these come in handy.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has ANY issues at all, reach out to me directly and let me know. You shouldn&#39;t because I triple check everything usually (the neurotic part of my personality wanting to make sure everything is perfect lol).</p>\n\n<p>Just remember to print in either landscape mode or portrait depending on the orientation of the forms. Select &quot;shrink to fit&quot; when printing if you need to. If any forms print out strange for you let me know and I&#39;ll take care of it for you. They shouldn&#39;t after the test prints I did a bunch of times. I tend to overthink and I&#39;m exhausted from work so I&#39;d rather everyone be completely happy with their orders.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!! Time for bed. I&#39;ll check the comments when I wake up. Take care everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
