  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey. Ive seen news that people have been donating crypto to Ukraine, but I’m struggling to find out how to do it (fairly new to crypto). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can I donate through and exchange like crypto.com, or do I need to transfer through a blockchain or what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any links or information at all on this, I would really appreciate it. If not I can always transfer fiat, but thought crypto seems like a good way to do it at the current time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if anyone has any advice on the best crypto to send to them (eth or BTC?), would help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the info ❤️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scammers really are vile creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some weird people on here. ‘Funding someone’s war’, ‘Russia uses bitcoin - bitcoin is bad’. There always has to be those few people who try to be too clever. Innocent civilians are dying because they’ve been invaded by a dictator, hellbent on making history, and all you care about is trying to win internet points by being edgy and against the grain. Get a grip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a small minority though, and thankfully most of this sub is full of kind people. Peace and love ❤️&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
