  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah, I’m not talking about money.  As some on this sub know, I’m a widower.  Lost the wife in a car accident going on 6 years.  I know most people don’t like to “get real” on Reddit, but here we are.  Anyway, I can’t stress this enough; no amount of planning can prepare you for what the universe has in store.  I used to obsess over money; scrimping and saving and attempting to squeeze every cent.  My dad worked 70 hours a week to fund my moms awful boomer shopping addict habits, and watching that, and the stress it caused him, permanently altered the way I looked at money.</p>\n\n<p>My wife was an artist.  She made little bits here and there, but her dream, our dream, was to publish a book.  I’m actually writing the final version, the one we were working on, when she passed.  Took a long, long time for me to pick it back up.  Once I finally get there, my life goals will be complete.</p>\n\n<p>I added a ton of stress to the woman of my dreams (I called her that when she was alive as well) because everything was about money.  Thinking back, I invested a lot, much of it planning to live our dreams and travel the world and what not.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere along the way of surviving her loss, I got into crypto.  Bought my first BTC in July 2017. Have continued to add in bits and pieces ever since.  I see a lot of people in this sub talking about how they have “yolo’ed” into X shitcoin or even quality projects without their partner knowing.  I hope a few of them are reading this.</p>\n\n<h1>there is a reason they say don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.</h1>\n\n<p>Is the prospect of massive riches (and an unlikely prospect at that)  worth risking you partner, your family, if you are wrong?  I think more people should consider this when investing in crypto, no matter the potential upside.</p>\n\n<p>I have many regrets about not spending more time with the person I wanted to spend my life with, but one of my biggest regrets is not having been able to find the balance in seeking riches and financial security, and these days I wish I had her balanced inputs and support in this hobby/ investment plan.  She was very level headed, and also saw the good in me I usually don’t. </p>\n\n<h1>Never forget, it’s only money guys.</h1>\n\n<p>If it’s shits and giggles money, go for it.  Life is short.  But if that first year alone taught me anything, it’s that i would have traded every cent I ever saved to spend one more day with her.  And I would have traded that day for her to have 5 more minutes with her kids.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the sob story.   I’m remarried with 5 kids now (life does go on!). Have very little time for socializing, and sometimes it’s just nice to write.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
