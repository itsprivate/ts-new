The one thing that is missing, but that soon will be developed, is a reliable e-cash. A method whereby on the internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A know B and B knowing A. The way in which i can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you and there is no record of where it came from. And you may get it without knowing who I am.”</em></p>\n\n<p><em>“I would like to get rid of the Federal Reserve too! I would like to have money controlled by computer!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>May your dreams come true Mr.Friedman. We’re working on it right now!</p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to share it here with you guys, to show,  how some of the people perceived the world then, and what we see now. </p>\n\n<p>We’re the future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
