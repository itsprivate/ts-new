Check it out to see how many moons you&#39;ll be getting next Wednesday at the end of Moon Week.  </p>\n\n<p>This Moon Week sticky will remain pinned to the top of the subreddit until next Wednesday to give exposure to our governance polls for this month.

All polls were <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/of0d1s/moon_week_reminder_submit_governance_polls_before/\">supposed to be submitted by today</a> so I could list them together, but as this is our first moon week you may want to check back Monday also to see if any more have been added.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that all future governance polls will need to be posted as a pre-proposal in <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta\">r/CryptoCurrencyMeta</a> for community feedback and so I can make sure I don&#39;t miss linking any in the sticky here</p>\n\n<p>For more information about moons, please <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki\">see our wiki page here</a>.  It is an ongoing effort to document what Moons are and how they work.  If there is anything that isn&#39;t included or sufficiently clear, please ask so we can answer you and improve the wiki page</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
