  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Too many people thinking a regular pump and dump is the same as a rug pull. It&#39;s not.</p>\n\n<p>To give an example - a s*itcoin named Lightcoin was trending/best gainer on Coinmarketcap a few days ago. Had a solid 50% daily pump. 40mill marketcap. Out of curiosity, I check it out, and see all the standard s*itcoin elements: most information can be found on <a href=\"/r/cryptomoonshots\">r/cryptomoonshots</a>, made in March 2021, dumped in April 2021, &quot;we have the best community&quot;, 10% tax (in and out), some mumbo jumbo on their page, you know the deal.</p>\n\n<p>So I keep following it. Today I see the price has pumped for another 20%. CMC page looks good. Then I check out a site called poocoin (you can presume the reason it&#39;s called poocoin, as it shows data on all BSC tokens/s*itcoins). It has some solid info, such as LP (more on that a bit later), number of holders, charts, recent txs etc.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now for the kicker: though today the CMC page shows healthy, sustainable growth through the last 7 days or so (even today), poocoin paints a bit different picture.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bpmkm86bklq71.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b85d9443e6d17e7bcfd0e94f0b993b4a5cc3769\">https://preview.redd.it/bpmkm86bklq71.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b85d9443e6d17e7bcfd0e94f0b993b4a5cc3769</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I know, the red candle of death is a sight to behold. But notice the numbers on the left. Mcap from $30mill to $175k. Liquidity pool is $1k. Over night. This is what a rug pull looks like. All (well almost all) liquidity is drained.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Just for comparison, this is your regular pump and dump or sell off by early investors/devs. Same coin, March and April. Not rug pull, because liquidity was still there (for the time being).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aj1ah8k5llq71.png?width=1217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77fcc87401a357043ac9d2dde941366d8c59e691\">https://preview.redd.it/aj1ah8k5llq71.png?width=1217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77fcc87401a357043ac9d2dde941366d8c59e691</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TL; DR: don&#39;t invest in s*itcoins on the BSC (or anywhere for that matter). If you really want to gamble, gamble in a place where at least you have 1% chance of winning. With these coins/tokens, there is none.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> as <a href=\"/u/hoanglpr\">/u/hoanglpr</a> rightfully pointed out, <strong>this may be a case of migrating to a new token</strong>. The new token shows up at the same time as the last one stopped working. Mcap is at $55mill, LP is at $1mill. If this is all true, my apologies to the team for judging them too quickly (I consider this to be my own learning experience). I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt, though if the last few months following tokens on BSC have taught me anything, this is just prolonging the inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>I remain by my statement that this is what a rug pull looks like, and people should know the difference between a P&amp;D and a rug pull.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
