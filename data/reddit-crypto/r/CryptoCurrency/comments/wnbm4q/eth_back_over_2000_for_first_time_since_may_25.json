Feels like it’s been forever but according to CMC data it was last over that mark at 12am on May 25th, so a little less than 3 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it just pumping because of the upcoming merge or is this the start of the next crypto rally? I tend to think this is a bit of a bull trap/bear rally, whatever you want to call it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My reason being for that is because the last couple major bull runs for crypto had a lot to do with high levels of cheap liquidity coming into the crypto markets (stimulus checks, very low borrowing rates, etc.). We don’t have these economic conditions in play currently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan is to continue buying on dips as I see them (mainly BTC and ETH, 80% of my portfolio) but not going in heavy now and saving more dry powder to wait on the next dips back towards the $1,500 range. Good luck to all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
