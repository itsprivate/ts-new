  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning, I saw a huge reduction in my ALGO rewards on Coinbase. (I keep the majority of my coins in my own wallet, but I had a small purchase I didn’t bother moving). Coinbase did offer 4% previously, but they have dramatically reduced the rewards. I just received this email. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We want to inform you about a recent change in your ALGO rewards that you might have noticed. With the transition of Algorand from a participation to governance model, the rewards rate has dropped significantly from 4% to 0.45%  as of March 8, 2022. We anticipate that you will see more fluctuations during the transitionary period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coinbase continues to participate in governance on your behalf and you are likely to see more governance rewards paid out in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Algorand publishes regular updates on how it calculates rewards on its own website.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a strong feeling someone at Coinbase missed the vote and now Coinbase won’t get paid, despite them saying they continue to participate in governance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see two huge problems. One is governance rewards are 6-7% APY, meaning CB is collecting over 90% of the rewards they receive, and users get peanuts. Additionally, Coinbase inevitably will vote for what’s best for Coinbase, not necessarily what’s best for Algorand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any ALGO sitting on Coinbase (or any exchange for that matter), I urge you to move them off the exchange and into your own wallet (MyALGO or Algorand Wallet) so you can participate in governance and get your due rewards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks to the commenters- the official Algorand Wallet has rebranded to Pera. I use MyAlgo and forgot this change happened. Apologies for the mistake&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
