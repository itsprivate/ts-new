  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are saying we&amp;#39;re not near a bottom yet because there&amp;#39;s not enough panic in this sub. Fair enough, that&amp;#39;s usually the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But combined with this relative &amp;quot;calm&amp;quot; amongst people in the crypto sphere as of yet, what we&amp;#39;re also seeing is altcoins holding the line in an unprecedented way. I thought it was just a few coins like LINK and ADA who were doing well. But I was just made aware of the fact that out of the top 100 on CMC, only 10 and 5 coins have &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; performing 7-day metrics than BTC and ETH respectively. Yes, you read that right. In this gigantic downturn, when BTC just broke it&amp;#39;s previous ATH which has never happened before, a time when there should be absolute doubt and panic, only 10 (!!!) coins have a worse 7-day performance than btc. This is unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m also reading a lot of, and a good point someone else made whose name I forgot, is that BTC and ETH are crashing because that&amp;#39;s where all the liquidations happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but BTC could drop another 70%, and so could all my alts, but the time for selling has been long gone, and in fact, even if BTC dropped another 70%, I would be buying. Not BTC, but more alts. Because the ones I have, I have no doubt about their future, so why wouldn&amp;#39;t I? Fucking bargain! It&amp;#39;s kinda funny because earlier I actually caught myself being irritated at LINK because it wasn&amp;#39;t dropping as hard as BTC, preventing me to scoop them up cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is, this crash doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be caused by doubtful panic like all the times before. We know what we have. And we&amp;#39;re not going to part with it. And given all this I just don&amp;#39;t feel that the thesis, that we need this whole sub to panic in order to find a bottom, to hold this time around. I&amp;#39;ve been here  since 2013 (I know, anecdotal), but something feels different. I don&amp;#39;t see myself suddenly start panicking if btc drops another 50%, you? The doubt and fear that we had all previous crashes is pretty much gone. This is just shitty liquidations happening, and who knows when they might stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now of course, naysayers might say that this very post is proof of the fact that we&amp;#39;re not near a bottom yet. Fair enough. But that doesn&amp;#39;t change the very different situation we seem to find ourselves in as described above this time around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
