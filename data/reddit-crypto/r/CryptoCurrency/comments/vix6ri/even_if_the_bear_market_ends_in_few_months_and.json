Also they will probably keep the bonds rates up. So overall it will be a bull market but in a different economic situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do you guys think about this? Will btc be able to reach new all time highs or it will be a much more relaxed bull market , btc around 45/50k max.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
