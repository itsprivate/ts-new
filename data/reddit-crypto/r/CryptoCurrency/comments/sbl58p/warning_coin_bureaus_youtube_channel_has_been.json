  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coin Bureau&amp;#39;s new YouTube video titled, &amp;#39;One World Cryptocurrency&amp;#39; is an obvious scam. Most of the comments on that video are probably bots. Its a 1 minute video and it just contains some slides on how to buy the new scam coin. Not sure if coin bureau is the only one affected by this hack. Guy has not provided an update yet but he will probably post something about it in his telegram channel or on his twitter account. Obviously the scam coin is on Binance Smart Chain, who could&amp;#39;ve seen that coming. This is as obvious of a scam as you&amp;#39;re ever gonna get, please don&amp;#39;t buy it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qqtnmjfzpmd81.jpg?width=234&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eeb255dee9fcc6c8fcf562c1d07a5cadd3551f4e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qqtnmjfzpmd81.jpg?width=234&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eeb255dee9fcc6c8fcf562c1d07a5cadd3551f4e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reasons why there is no way this was posted by the Coin Bureau team:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Its a scam.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Guy does not give financial advice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#39;t post short videos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Guy has confirmed on Twitter that their account has been hacked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Some other YouTube channels that have been hacked have also published the same video. These channels include The Moon, Floyd Mayweather, aantonop and Crypto Banter&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
