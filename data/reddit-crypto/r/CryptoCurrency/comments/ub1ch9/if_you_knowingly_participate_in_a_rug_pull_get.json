But trying to get others to buy into something when you already know it&amp;#39;s a quick rich scheme makes you a shitty person.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can compare it to people who promote pyramid schemes because they got tricked into it by others and want to continue the scam so they won&amp;#39;t be idiots at the end.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: if you knowingly promote a scam to make some money for yourself, you are just as bad as the people who created the scam.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
