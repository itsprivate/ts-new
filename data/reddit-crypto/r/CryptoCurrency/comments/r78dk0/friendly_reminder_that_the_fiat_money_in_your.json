They are telling us that BTC, ETH and such are basically worthless because it doesn&amp;#39;t have a physical existence and are not backed by a government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, those people conveniently forget that fiat money doesn&amp;#39;t exist, either. Well, most of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, banks are allowed to leverage their holdings in what is called the fractional reserve banking system. If you deposit 100$, for example, they only keep a fraction of that money in cash (let&amp;#39;s say 20$), and they use the remaining 80$ to generate yield, generally by lending. What that means is, if every customers of the bank tries to cash out in a short amount of time, &lt;strong&gt;the money won&amp;#39;t be there, because it&amp;#39;s been lent and doesn&amp;#39;t exist anymore&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you deposit cash in a bank, what you get in return is basically a glorified IOU. Should the bank get into trouble, your cash could very well disappear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, the governement can intervene to prevent such bank runs. But it&amp;#39;s always in the favor of the rich. That&amp;#39;s what happened in 2008-2009 : the fat cats got bailed out, while the ordinary citizens went into bankruptcy. And it only works in stable countries ; when you live in a failed state, the government won&amp;#39;t help you in such a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compare that with crypto. If you are in control of your keys, and assuming their are not compromised, &lt;strong&gt;nobody&lt;/strong&gt; can access your funds without your permission. Not the wallet devs, not the government, not the DEX. Nobody. &lt;strong&gt;You are in full control, and you will still be in control even if the governement of your country collapse&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that sense, I think that cryptocurrencies are actually more real then fiat money. Decentralised networks are much more resilient then centralised authorities, and therefore are more likely to survive in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think we still got a few years ahead of us before the mainstream media catches up with this revolution. Until then, I will accumulate as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
