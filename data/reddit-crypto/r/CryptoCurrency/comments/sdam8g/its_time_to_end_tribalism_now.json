It’s a load of crap. The bill sneaks in a part where the secretary of Treasury (Janet Yellen) will have full control to just ban assets at will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means she can ban ALL of crypto or just certain ones in particular. She can wake up and say hey no more ETH trading in America. Exchanges will have to comply. This is serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I normally don’t post because I’m not good with all the formatting and pretty pictures but this is so fucking serious guys. Stop with the stupid tribalism, stop acting like children. Now is the time to come together and reach out to the people who live off our tax dollars that are supposed to serve us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you follow the money guess who’s lobbying so hard for this to pass? Ding ding ding : the Goldman Sachs Mafia. Banks are finally trying to put the nail in the coffin for crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: stop bickering for one moment and pay attention to this BS legislation that’s about to change crypto. Also fuck off and read my shit, it’s like 10 sentences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
