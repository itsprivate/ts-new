Im repeating, 90 freaking thousand holders. What worrying is that the project (scam) was backed by ChainLink itself. They even tweeted it on their official twitter about this coin and how this coin is the number 1 polygon casino game coin.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: PolygonDaily with 56k followers also recommended this project to its followers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This shows why countries can ban cryptos easily when projects that were trusted for years like ChainLink recommend you scam coins like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The project was verifies by RugDoc, the doxxed team, and a well built website with 90k holders. Anyone can blindfoldedly buy this. What lesson do we learn from this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
