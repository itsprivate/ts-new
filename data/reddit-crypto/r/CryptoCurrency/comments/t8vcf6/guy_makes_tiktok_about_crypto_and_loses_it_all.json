He zhen tells the viewer to follow elon musk on twitter so you get notified when he talks about doge coin and you should invest right away. He then closed the video with the sentence „i will post daily updates on the progress, time to get rich“.\nI kid you not, the very next video he shows all red digits and how he collectively lost 40k in crypto and says his school fund is ruined, and how he only has about 1k $ left and will quit tiktok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has the video pls link it\nTy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: someone found it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/kg8RA5qeJPs\"&gt;https://youtu.be/kg8RA5qeJPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
