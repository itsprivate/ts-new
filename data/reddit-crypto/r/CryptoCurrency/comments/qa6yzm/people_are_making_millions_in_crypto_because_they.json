Majority of crypto hodlers are on the younger side so it’s a no-brained why most don’t have a lot of money. </p>\n\n<p>How did people have thousands already to start with? They saved and invested, and kept investing their money to build up their wealth. </p>\n\n<p>Yes there’s the rare occasions where young kids, celebrities, etc make a lot more because they were given money or already had a lot of money to begin with. </p>\n\n<p>So what? Jealous? Do something about it and stop complaining. There’s SO many ways to make money. You’re not limited to just crypto. There’s stocks, real estate, starting a business, you name it.</p>\n\n<p>We are lucky we live in a time where a coin named after a dog has performed better than most cryptocurrencies and stocks. </p>\n\n<p>We are lucky we have the opportunity to put $100 into a coin and turn it into $1000s later. And to be able to do this at the comfort at our homes without doing any work on top of that. </p>\n\n<p>Lesson is, be grateful for what you have and what opportunities are presented to you. There are many people out there who are struggling financially due to the pandemic. There are people who live in other states/countries who can’t or makes it hard for them to invest in crypto. </p>\n\n<p>Wealthy families pass down their wealth generation after generation. If you’re still reading this, perhaps you can be the start of your families wealth. That’s why we’re all in crypto right? </p>\n\n<p>Take advantage of this opportunity, do your own research, and save what you can to keep investing. However enjoy life while you’re at it. It doesn’t matter how many millions you have when you’re 60, 70, 80 years old when you’re old and can barely walk. </p>\n\n<p>Living is not staring at charts and telling your grandkids all you did with your life was that. Experience the world and meet new people. You never know who you’ll meet and how important that person will be in the future. Making good money usually coincides with meeting the right people. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck all!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: please don’t award this post! Buy more crypto! It just dropped a bit just now at the time of this writing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
