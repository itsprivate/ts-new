As long as you know what you support in your coin, you have a purpose in it that you believe. Which is what investing is, not closing your eyes and picking a coin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only you won&amp;#39;t be rich, but you&amp;#39;ll also lose your money in these coins. Only people getting rich will be those controlling the coin with their bags that are ready to sell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course, there still are those projects with purpose and that can change the market, but you&amp;#39;ll need a lot of time on your hands to find those new ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
