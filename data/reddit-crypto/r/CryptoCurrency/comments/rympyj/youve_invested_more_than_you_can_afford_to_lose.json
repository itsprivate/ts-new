We are all our own people with our own financial responsibilities, and we don’t owe each other anything. We are not a collective group and no one here owes us anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might get rich off crypto, but you more than likely won’t. Why? Because most of us don’t have the patience or mental fortitude to hold through bear markets and crashes that it takes to see your investment go to the moon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do your own research, invest what you can afford to lose, and deal with the consequences of your actions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a good weekend, my dudes!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
