They said they couldn&#39;t find the bank account (which I send money regularly). They returned my money after 10 days  but didn&#39;t refund the $50 fee.</p>\n\n<p>what happened:  </p>\n\n<p>10 days ago I wanted to send some money to my broker in the US ($6500)</p>\n\n<p>I have been sending swift payments for years, and as usual I entered information and sent. They said it should take 1 to 3 days (lol, why? but okay.). I also paid $35 fees for this slow process.</p>\n\n<p>3 days later, someone from my bank called and said intermediatery bank couldn&#39;t find the bank account and they need me to send a handwritten signed document telling them where to send money. They said it is okay if I take a photo of the paper and send them.  </p>\n\n<p>I wrote one and sent. They called back and said it is too long. I only need to write bank name and account. I wrote another one and sent.  </p>\n\n<p>5 more days passed. I called the bank like 10 times and they answered only 1 time. They said they are looking into it but it can take up to 1 month as it takes time to manually review.  </p>\n\n<p>10 days from initial Swift, they returned money. But, not only they kept original 35 dollars fees but also cut another 15 dollars. So total $50 in fees. They didn&#39;t do the work I paid them to do and kept my money for 10 days.   </p>\n\n<p>So how are they supposed to be the future? In what world they can charge for something that they don&#39;t provide? How can they hold my money 10 days?   </p>\n\n<p>I am sure all of us can relate to this. Future is bright for De-Fi. F*ck banks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
