Decentralised social media networks like Mirror and GM already exist that do not have any token and can be used already. Mirror especially is growing in popularity as an alternative to Medium among crypto users. It doesnt have any token, and only uses Metamask to verify the authenticity of your account. For example Vitalik could verify himself with his ENS address. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas DESO seems to be only interesting in pushing their token first and has a market cap of over $650m without even a functional product. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why should I buy a token to use a decentralised social media network first?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
