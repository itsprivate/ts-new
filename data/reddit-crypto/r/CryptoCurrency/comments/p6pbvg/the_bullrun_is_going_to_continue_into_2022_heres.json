However, having completed extensive research in the last few days, I can tell you with complete confidence that <strong>the bull market will continue through to New Years, and beyond!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I present to you three points that confirm my theory:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bitcoin will hit $100k in 2021</li>\n<li>Bullish investors outnumber Bears</li>\n<li>Warren Buffet told me <strong><em>personally</em></strong> that the Bullrun will go through to 2022.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>----- 1. Bitcoin will hit $100k -----</strong></p>\n\n<p>Figure 1 indicates BTC’s path from August 2020 to August 2021 (present), represented by the Blue Line. </p>\n\n<p>The Red Line indicates Bitcoin’s path to $100k for the rest of the year. This has been determined based on <strong><em>weeks</em></strong> of research I have performed (which I will not bother to explain as I am too tired; just take my word for it).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fkw7kqclq3i71.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6907991d3c7cf62fbb8d571636707d51be781ab\">Figure 1. The Red Line indicates Bitcoin&#39;s price change from August 2021 to New Year&#39;s. As you can see, we will easily hit $100k by then!</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is irrefutable evidence isn’t it! What a great analyser I am. Bitcoin to $100k by the end of the year is a certainty, and therefore indicates the Bullrun will continue on strongly.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>----- 2. Bullish investors outnumber Bears -----</strong></p>\n\n<p>This part requires very complex calculations. I have mathematically determined that there are more Bullish investors than Bearish, through an extensive algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>This sub has 3.3 million members; all of these people are hopeful that the Bull Market will continue on to 2022. Dividing this number by the current population of Earth, 7.9 billion, gives us Figure 2:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oyi2v7lyq3i71.png?width=508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9548bf7d53008e1ef8dc7bbc3cdce9a779fe3246\">Figure 2. Don&#39;t worry if these calculations are too confusing. Maths can be hard!</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>From this, we can see that 42% of people in the world are bullish on crypto. That’s nearly half of <strong><em>everyone alive</em></strong>! Therefore, we can safely guarantee that there are more Bulls than Bears currently.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>----- 3. Warren Buffet confirms the Bullrun will last until 2022 -----</strong></p>\n\n<p>I managed to get a hold of Mr Buffet, a famed investor and long-term supporter of money. I sent him the following message:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ggltrxcbr3i71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b4646370386ff173d522c9526b645d501fbc790\">Figure 3. Thank you Mr Buffet for contributing to my epic research!</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Astonishing! Warren Buffet believes the Bullrun is going into next year. He is one of the richest people alive: therefore we must take his word for it!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>----- Summary -----</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to my excellent research, I have determined with 99.7% accuracy that <strong>the Bullrun will continue into 2022.</strong> Please trust me on this: would I ever lie to you good people?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading. Nutty Joe over and out  <strong>😎</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
