In 2013 and 2017, BTC momentarily traded below said support before ultimately resuming its macro uptrend.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s <strong>14-Month RSI</strong> is currently 69.9 and back in &quot;neutral&quot; territory for the first time since October 2020. This reversion lower suggests BTC is trending in a manner akin to the 2013 bull market.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s <strong>MVRV Z-score</strong> of 2.94 is down -28% from last week&#39;s reading of 4.09 and sits at a 5-month low. BTC was trading at $19,400 the last time its z-score was this low.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s <strong>SOPR Indicator</strong> has fallen to a reading of 1.0126, a level last seen in September 2020. With the SOPR indicator fast approaching a reading of 1, one could expect BTC to bounce higher in the days/weeks ahead. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ethereum&#39;s Logarithmic Regression Rainbow</h3>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bauz3391zyz61.png?width=3304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af00b6ffcad18148a5acb9b1dff647d31e485090\">https://preview.redd.it/bauz3391zyz61.png?width=3304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af00b6ffcad18148a5acb9b1dff647d31e485090</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using ETH’s historical price action, we can plot logarithmic regression trendlines that coincide with historical levels of support and resistance.</li>\n<li>These lines can be useful for navigating bull and bear market cycles, as well as for identifying critical levels of support and resistance.</li>\n<li>Do note that with each day that passes, ETH&#39;s logarithmic regression rainbow trends higher. This means the longer ETH can continue to trend higher to the next subsequent regression trendline, potentially the higher the market cycle top.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At a current price of $3,392, ETH currently resides between Band 5 ($2,857) and Band 6 ($5,327).</li>\n<li>Based on these regression lines, ETH&#39;s next big test of resistance is currently at $5,327 while support resides around $2,857.</li>\n<li>ETH would have to rally +57% to test resistance at $5,327 and would have to correct -16% to test support at $2,857.</li>\n<li>A move up to Band 8, which coincides with ETH’s previous market cycle top, would imply a $16,164 Ether and a +313.0% return from current price.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s +1 Yr. HODL Wave</h3>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/axsnoft7zyz61.png?width=3522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc60cf9da6143e3c2b7e3ae8c9498344123d823d\">https://preview.redd.it/axsnoft7zyz61.png?width=3522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc60cf9da6143e3c2b7e3ae8c9498344123d823d</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s +1 Yr. HODL Wave shows what percentage of coins in circulation haven&#39;t been moved in at least 1 year.</li>\n<li>When charted against BTC&#39;s price, one can identify trends that coincide with bull and bear market cycles. </li>\n<li>Historically, a local top in the +1 Yr. HODL wave is congruent with the start of a new bull market. When the number of untouched coins begins to decline amid rapid price appreciation, one can be confident that a new bull market cycle is likely underway.</li>\n<li>When the downward slope of the HODL wave grows increasingly steeper, one can assume that selling pressure is beginning to increase and supply is likely to outpace demand. As such, a cycle top is presumably creeping closer.</li>\n<li>Prior to hitting a local high, a gradual increase in the +1 Yr. HODL wave signals that market participants are in &quot;accumulation mode.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current +1 Yr. HODL Wave reading sits at 54.67%, i.e. 54.67% of all coins in circulation haven&#39;t been moved in more than a year. This is down -8.7 percentage points from a local top of 63.4% set on September 9, 2020.</li>\n<li>On January 31, 2013, BTC&#39;s +1 Yr. HODL Wave hit a local high of 48.2% and the price of BTC was at $20.40. When BTC hit a cycle high of $1,158 on November 30, 2013, the +1 Yr. HODL Wave reading was at 38.8%. That is, over the course of 303 days, the number of coins that hadn&#39;t been moved in more than a year had fallen 9.4 percentage points while price appreciated +5,580%.</li>\n<li>On January 19, 2016, BTC&#39;s +1 Yr. HODL Wave hit a local high of 61.5% and the price of BTC was at $380. When BTC hit a cycle high of $19,660 on December 17, 2017, the HODL Wave reading was at 43.1%. That is, over the course of 698 days, BTC&#39;s HODL Wave fell -18.4 percentage points while price appreciated +5,073%. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s 200W Moving Avg. Multiple</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/57zqk5pbzyz61.png?width=3560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2f883fb55e4bca50b01a932d1a1d169ef6495d0\">https://preview.redd.it/57zqk5pbzyz61.png?width=3560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2f883fb55e4bca50b01a932d1a1d169ef6495d0</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>200W Moving Average:</strong> A critical level of support used to determine an overall long-term market trend. The trendline measures the average price of BTC over the prior 200 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Moving Average Multiple:</strong> The multiple with which BTC is trading at relative to its 200-week moving average. For example, a multiple of 4.0x means BTC is trading at 4x its 200-week moving average.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In prior bull market cycles, BTC has traded as much as 10x - 15x its 200-week moving average prior to entering a bear market.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 200-week moving average is 3.54x. That is, BTC is trading at 3.54x its 200-week moving average ($12,630), <strong>down from last week&#39;s multiple of 3.74x and representing a 3-month low.</strong></li>\n<li>Given today&#39;s 200-week moving average of $12,630, a 10x - 15x multiple would imply a BTC price of $126,300 - $189,450.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 10.3X for the week of April 4, 2013. On April 9, 2013, BTC hit a cycle high of $259.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 13.2X for the week of November 25, 2013, which coincided with a market cycle top of $1,158.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 15.2X for the week of December 11, 2017. That same week, price hit a cycle high of $19,660.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s Bull Market Weekly Support</h3>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g6ubizoezyz61.png?width=3392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=256bef17ad35cab705d3d969c981bf348a2e134b\">https://preview.redd.it/g6ubizoezyz61.png?width=3392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=256bef17ad35cab705d3d969c981bf348a2e134b</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s Bull Market Weekly Support tracks two critical levels of support that have acted as last lines of defense in prior bull market cycles: BTC&#39;s 20-week exponential moving average and 21-week simple moving average.</li>\n<li>In prior bull market cycles, BTC has mean reverted down to the 20W EMA and 21W SMA before bouncing and resuming its uptrend.</li>\n<li>When BTC breaks below both moving averages, the likelihood of BTC&#39;s bull market coming to an end is heightened.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At a price of $44,700, BTC&#39;s 20-week exponential moving average is $46,823 and its 21-week simple moving average is $48,370.</li>\n<li>BTC posted a weekly close below the bull market weekly support on Sunday, May 16 for the first time since March 2020. Although bearish, we&#39;ve seen several instances in the past where BTC momentarily traded below the weekly support band before resuming its macro uptrend.</li>\n<li>A move back up to BTC&#39;s 20-week exponential moving average equates to a +4.8% gain from current price.</li>\n<li>A return back above BTC&#39;s 21-week simple moving average equates to a +8.2% rally from current levels. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s Logarithmic Growth Curve</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qm26mhkkzyz61.png?width=3386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ec56e56c708f4b2e90c16a4396eea7d59c6ca51\">https://preview.redd.it/qm26mhkkzyz61.png?width=3386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ec56e56c708f4b2e90c16a4396eea7d59c6ca51</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s logarithmic growth curve consists of two sets of curved trendlines that have historically proven to be critical levels of support and resistance.</li>\n<li>While both lines point to price ranges whereby BTC is arguably &quot;overbought&quot; or &quot;oversold,&quot; they also represent a notable underlying property of BTC that can be found in social networks, technological innovations, pandemics, societies, and economics: exponential growth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC is a +86% to +144% move away from entering into &quot;overbought&quot; territory, which is currently between $83,306 and $109,134.</li>\n<li>BTC is a -50% to -62% move away from falling into &quot;oversold&quot; territory. This week&#39;s range is $17,143 - $22,458.</li>\n<li>At a current price of $44,700, BTC resides in the 49 percentile of the logarithmic growth curve&#39;s $17,143 - $109,134 range.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Kraken Intelligence&#39;s Bitcoin Logarithmic Retracement Curve</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/75uztp7rzyz61.png?width=3390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c37ef5ba24760aa9b04e27040b46fa05f4c63901\">https://preview.redd.it/75uztp7rzyz61.png?width=3390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c37ef5ba24760aa9b04e27040b46fa05f4c63901</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s logarithmic retracement curve uses the growth curve&#39;s uptrending support line and historical price action to back into an implied market cycle top.</li>\n<li>Since 2011, BTC has long respected the growth curve&#39;s support line and has historically retraced down to said level upon hitting a market cycle top.</li>\n<li>When considering BTC&#39;s previous bull market cycles, one will find that it takes, on average, 385 days for BTC to retrace back down to the support band after hitting a top.</li>\n<li>Also, one will find that BTC has corrected, on average, -86% after the bull market ends. </li>\n<li>By knowing where the price of the support curve is 385 days from today and making assumptions about how severe BTC will correct after hitting a cycle top, one can have a better sense as to where BTC would need to be trading to correct down to the support band over a period of 385 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The price of BTC&#39;s logarithmic growth curve support 385 days from today is $35,229.</li>\n<li>Assuming BTC corrects -70% this market cycle, BTC would need to be trading at $117K for BTC to retrace down to support 385 days from today.</li>\n<li>An -86% correction implies a $255K cycle top and a -90% correction implies a $352K cycle top.</li>\n<li>According to this model, BTC is not currently in &quot;market cycle top&quot; territory.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin&#39;s Monthly Upper Bollinger Band &amp; RSI</h3>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pfplq9quzyz61.png?width=3578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e24cdf4e46b5788f32df9c1db3e0b13b78002b6\">https://preview.redd.it/pfplq9quzyz61.png?width=3578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e24cdf4e46b5788f32df9c1db3e0b13b78002b6</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bollinger Bands:</strong> A technical indicator that can be used to measure volatility and identify “overbought” or “oversold” conditions. When trading above the upper band, an asset can be considered &quot;overbought.&quot; If trading below, the asset is considered &quot;oversold.&quot; Oftentimes, the upper and lower Bollinger band represents a +/- 2 standard deviation move from a 20-period moving average. However, we&#39;ll be keeping an eye on a +4.5 standard deviation upper Bollinger band relative to BTC&#39;s 20-month moving average.</li>\n<li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> One of most popular and widely used momentum oscillators. It measures over a 14-period duration and fluctuates between 0 and 100. A reading below 30 indicates &quot;oversold,&quot; a reading over 70 signals &quot;overbought.&quot; Given its historical relevance, we&#39;ll be focusing on BTC&#39;s 14-month RSI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current intramonth high of $59,603 came $38,286 short of crossing its monthly upper Bollinger band of $97,889.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s 14-month RSI is currently 69.9 and is in &quot;neutral&quot; territory for the first time since October 2020. The trend in BTC&#39;s monthly RSI appears to be akin to 2013 when the index entered into &quot;overbought&quot; territory, then &quot;neutral&quot; territory, and then back into &quot;overbought&quot; territory upon BTC&#39;s second parabolic uptrend of 2013.</li>\n<li><p>In April 2013, November 2013, and December 2017, BTC hit an intramonth high above its monthly upper Bollinger band as price set a market cycle top. Only in these 3 instances have we seen BTC break through its +4.5 standard deviation monthly upper Bollinger band. BTC&#39;s 14-month RSI also topped out well into &quot;overbought&quot; territory at a reading of 96.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bitcoin&#39;s MVRV Z-Score</strong>   </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qyn2842zzyz61.png?width=3562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b82690ccfeab398b82259d66d49aa515b2baf7\">https://preview.redd.it/qyn2842zzyz61.png?width=3562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b82690ccfeab398b82259d66d49aa515b2baf7</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What Is A Z-Score?</strong> A numerical measurement that can explain a value&#39;s relationship to a group&#39;s average. It is measured in terms of standard deviations. For example, a z-score of 0 means that a value is identical to the mean and a z-score of 1.0 means that a value is one standard deviation above the average.</li>\n<li><strong>BTC&#39;s MVRV Z-Score:</strong> Considers BTC&#39;s market value and realized value to help determine when BTC may be over/undervalued. A z-score between 7 and 11 (pink box) suggests BTC is &quot;overbought.&quot; When between 0.9 and -0.3 (green box), BTC is believed to be &quot;oversold.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>MVRV Z-Score Formula:</strong> (Market Value – Realized Value) / (Std. Deviation of Market Value).</li>\n<li><strong>Market Value:</strong> BTC&#39;s price multiplied by coins in circulation, i.e. market cap.</li>\n<li><strong>Realized Value:</strong> The price of each BTC when it was last moved. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current MVRV z-score is 2.94, down -1.7% from yesterday&#39;s reading of 2.99, down -28.1% from last week&#39;s reading of 4.09, and now at a 5-month low. The last time BTC&#39;s MVRV z-score was this low, BTC was trading at $19,400.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s market value is down -2.3% at $893B and its realized value is unchanged at $377B.</li>\n<li>A +138.1% increase in BTC&#39;s z-score would put the indicator in &quot;overbought&quot; territory. A -69.4% correction would put the indicator in &quot;oversold&quot; territory.</li>\n<li>Prior z-score tops: \n\n<ul>\n<li>April 9, 2013: 11.05</li>\n<li>November 23, 2013: 10.8</li>\n<li>December 8, 2017: 9.77</li>\n<li>Average score: 10.54</li>\n<li>Note: These z-score readings topped out 1 day, 7 days, and 11 days, respectively, ahead of a market cycle top.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>On February 21, 2021, BTC&#39;s z-score hit a 3-year high of 7.62.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bitcoin&#39;s Stock-to-Flow Ratio</strong>  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/plcfvdf30zz61.png?width=3568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a4d9ed4be032c4f8c9483fcf324f76a724d69f5\">https://preview.redd.it/plcfvdf30zz61.png?width=3568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a4d9ed4be032c4f8c9483fcf324f76a724d69f5</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Read This Chart:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Much like gold and silver, we can consider BTC&#39;s circulating supply (stock) against its expected production of new supply (flow) to get a stock-to-flow ratio. </li>\n<li>A high stock-to-flow ratio implies that a commodity is growing increasingly scarce and more valuable as a result.</li>\n<li>By overlaying BTC&#39;s price against its stock-to-flow ratio, one will find that BTC&#39;s price has trended alongside the ratio over the years.</li>\n<li>One will also find that BTC&#39;s price continues to diverge less and less from its stock-to-flow ratio, which is a 365-day average; when price trends above the stock-to-flow ratio, the divergence is positive (&gt;1) and thus BTC may be considered &quot;overbought.&quot;</li>\n<li>The multi-colored line denotes the number of days until Bitcoin&#39;s next halving, which is when the mining reward for a new block is cut in half. This reduction in new coins (flow) drives BTC&#39;s stock-to-flow ratio higher, implying that BTC is scarcer and thus more valuable. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin is 1078 days out from its next halving, at which point its block reward will fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.</li>\n<li>BTC&#39;s current divergence is 0.46, down from yesterday&#39;s reading of 0.47 and down from last week&#39;s reading of 0.56.</li>\n<li>Prior market cycle tops coincided with a divergence reading of 40.8 (June 2011), 9.8 (April 2013), 9.75 (December 2013), and 3.5 (December 2017).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All charts taken from Kraken&#39;s OTC daily email.</p>\n\n<p>“<em>All models are wrong, but some are useful.</em>”<br/>\n- George E.
