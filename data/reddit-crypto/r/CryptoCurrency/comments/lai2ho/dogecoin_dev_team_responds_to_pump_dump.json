However, we will not bail you out, as with great freedom comes great responsibility. We take ours seriously and we hope that you will too in the future.\nWe have now closed this topic. Request denied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I messaged the modteam over at <a href=\"/r/dogecoin\">r/dogecoin</a> mentioning that it would be a very responsible move of them to let the community know that this is the engineering team&#39;s official stance. A lot of new users are banking on this occurring, as pump &amp; dump groups have convinced them that if it does their investment is going to skyrocket.</p>\n\n<p>Not holding my breath, though.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
