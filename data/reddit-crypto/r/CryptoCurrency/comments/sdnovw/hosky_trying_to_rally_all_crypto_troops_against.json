One Senator with ties to banking has snuck this into a bill that has absolutely nothing to do with crypto. If this passes, the Treasury Secretary could just decide that crypto should be illegal. No debate, no hearings, just unilateral power. Call your local Rep/Senator and let them hear that this is NOT representation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
