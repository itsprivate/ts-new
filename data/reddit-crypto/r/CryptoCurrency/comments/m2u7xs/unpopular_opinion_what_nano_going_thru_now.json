LIke BTC with the ghash mining pool fiasco where they got 51% of mining power. Ethereum with their DAO hack.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, crypto are all bleeding edge technology and needs to have serious tests against the fire.  This is the test for NANO.  I am actually surprised their network still handling under 5 seconds per transaction.  Anyways, the coins that passed these fires will survive and have a lasting legacy.  </p>\n\n<p>I also don&#39;t get the cheering for Nano to fail.  Unless you are a short seller of Nano, but as a crypto lovers, shouldn&#39;t we want to see more innovation to test the limit of what crypto can be?  To see how a coin would handle under 500 TPS while remaining free? </p>\n\n<p>The Nano founder who has this idealistic notion that crypto should be free and instant, it&#39;s crazy and ambitious.  We should want that type of innovation in this space.</p>\n\n<p>And do people actually realize how staggering the number 500 TPS is in actual production environment? VISA with their massive global network of nodes can handle about 1700 TPS, 500 TPS is like the scale of PayPal.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
