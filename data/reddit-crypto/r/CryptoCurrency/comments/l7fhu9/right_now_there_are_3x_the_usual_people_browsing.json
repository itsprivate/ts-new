Here that rule is 3 to 1. You can promote your product / favorite coin / service so long as you make 3 posts that show ordinary interaction. Just try not to make them low-quality interactions.<br/></li>\n<li>Only two posts are allowed on the front page per coin. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only exceptions.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you guys have any questions comments or otherwise need to know info, fire away. Knowledge is free and should always be that way.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Terminology for newbies:</strong></h1>\n\n<p>CEX / Centralized Exchange: an exchange where you must conduct KYC (know your customer) and AML (Anti-money laundering) steps to set up an account. This is akin to opening a bank account, except it&#39;s all online with people you&#39;ve never seen face-to-face. Examples: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken.<br/>\nDEX / Decentralized Exchange: An exchange without KYC or AML. It can be difficult to find one that lets you turn cash in to crypto. Most of these are crypto-to-crypto exchange platforms. Examples: 1inch, Uniswap, Honeyswap.<br/>\nCentralized: basically anything that has a single (or close to single) point of failure. You can&#39;t send money to Julian Assange or Snowden through your bank because they adhere to a centralized authority (the u.s. government).<br/>\nDecentralized: basically anything that does not have a single point of failure. Bitcoin is decentralized because no one can stop you from sending bitcoin to Julian Assange or Snowden. However, you can be punished in retrospect if you are not careful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
