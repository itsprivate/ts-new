(<em>NANO IS OUT OF THE TOP 100, IT&#39;S OFFICIALLY DEAD!</em>) Neither does the fact that it&#39;s now gone up in value mean it&#39;s suddenly a success. $40 Nano has no better or worse fundamentals than $1 Nano.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, from an investment point of view, the price of course matters. And let&#39;s be honest, <em>most</em> of us are here to make money, perhaps to be financially independent. But the true measure of whether or not a cryptocurrency is successful or not should be whether it does what it sets out to do and does it well. Look at the fundamentals, adoption, development, and not <em>just</em> the price.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, with that said I&#39;m off to check the price of my crypto. When moon?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
