When that happens and everyone scrambles online to try and paperhand sell their crypto in a race to the bottom they seem to always work impeccably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the markets suddenly surge over 10% and they suddenly just cannot handle the bandwidth. Almost as if they had significantly too little crypto in their reserves and a sudden price hike would mean they didn&amp;#39;t have the time to increase their reserves. Almost as if they were expecting the market to drop further and that gamble didn&amp;#39;t pay off so better bring out the ol &amp;#39;we&amp;#39;re experiencing technical difficulty please stand by.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course perhaps it&amp;#39;s all a giant coincidence it happens every time....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
