  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has about 144 million people within it&amp;#39;s territory (contested and non contested). After sanctions and severe economic restrictions placed on the nation and it&amp;#39;s inhabitants by the rest of the world due to the invasion of Ukraine, crypto is pumping, and BTC alone is up 13% or so. On top of that, it&amp;#39;s likely that a smaller percentage of that population are the ones buying given current worldwide so really the movement happened with a small percentage of that population amount. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this event can cause this amount price of an increase, what happens when a global population of a little under 8 BILLION decides to adopt BTC as a hedge against uncertainty and war or simply as a means to transact with minimal fees in a transparent and decentralized way? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a hopium induced thought, what if the change in BTC price today was true and held a similar linear relationship with each approximate 2% increase in adoption (measured by the corresponding increase in % of world population)? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, so I gave this simple model a try. I increased world population at 2%. I then found a multiplication factor by dividing the increase in BTC price by the percentage of the population that adopted today presumably and just assumed that would hold true for each 2% adoption. I then carried that out through 2% intervals until we got close to full world adoption and found a value for BTC assuming a spot price of $43,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0zoq5m72yok81.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a7075db314300dc435d6679ed7a64f6bf4373ef3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0zoq5m72yok81.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a7075db314300dc435d6679ed7a64f6bf4373ef3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say there is a pretty bright future as seen above and this is with an extremely limited/rudimentary model with lot&amp;#39;s of assumptions. I think that answer is conservative because of halving, significant future inflation, and other factors of demand and BTC&amp;#39;s scarce supply. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you all think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
