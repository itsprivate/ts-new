If they want the traffic from our community, they shouldn&amp;#39;t expect us to pay it with fiat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remove link posts to paywalled articles unless a paywall features an easy to notice and use cryptocurrency payment option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the quality paywalled content will not be able to reach the hot section of this sub and people will miss out on the opportunity to read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the articles might have paywalls that offer crypto payment options but they might not be obvious from the first look (think hidden in a 3rd step of the checkout process after you enter a lot of data). We can not expect our moderators to spend way too much time exploring if the paywall on a specific site someone linked can be paid with crypto or not. The option needs to be easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/wg4pa3\"&gt;View Poll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
