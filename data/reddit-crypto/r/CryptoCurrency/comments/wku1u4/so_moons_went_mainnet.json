Im sure there are others wondering the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a dex mellon posted, but connecting wallet to it seems to be complicated on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys using honeyswap or some other swap service ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you send moons to another wallet and use the tokens from there ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you cover gas fees ? Does the dex take gas fee and deducts it ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many questions and very hard to find answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People seem to be using &lt;a href=\"https://rcpswap.com/#/swap\"&gt;https://rcpswap.com/#/swap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im to dense to make it work on my phone. Will try later when ( if ) I get access to a secure computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
