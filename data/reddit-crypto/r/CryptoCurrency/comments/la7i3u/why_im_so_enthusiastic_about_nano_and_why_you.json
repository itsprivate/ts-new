So in this post - my reason for being so enthusiastic about Nano, how you can try Nano out within 2 minutes, and what the future for Nano might be like.</p>\n\n<h1>Why am I so enthusiastic about Nano?</h1>\n\n<p>I got into crypto because I believe in having a decentralised digital currency. I believe that a future in which all people have direct access to an undebaseable, self-sovereign currency is a far better future than a future in which we are bound to using fiat currencies to pay.</p>\n\n<p>I believe Nano is the currency that stands the best chance at being this decentralised digital currency. I&#39;m in agreement with Elon Musk that when it comes to currencies, &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704\">whichever has least error &amp; latency will win</a>&quot;. There needs to be as little friction as possible in currencies as possible - in terms of latency, throughput, and fees. How does Nano fit in here? Well, Nano&#39;s fundamentals are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nanocrawler.cc/network\">Lowest latency cryptocurrency</a> (0.15 seconds to fully confirm, on average)</li>\n<li>Zero fees - no leeching middlemen</li>\n<li>Incredibly secure - deterministic finality versus the probabilistic finality of traditional cryptocurrencies</li>\n<li>Has never had a double spend, re-organisation, or inflation bug</li>\n<li>Had a <a href=\"https://medium.com/nanocurrency/nano-protocol-security-audit-summary-and-full-report-48760be8ab3d\">third party security audit</a></li>\n<li>No inflation - fully distributed</li>\n<li>Incredibly energy efficient/green - the entire network can run on roughly one windmill</li>\n<li>High throughput (<a href=\"https://forum.nano.org/t/nano-stress-tests-measuring-bps-cps-tps-in-the-real-world/436\">200 CPS+ in latest stresstests</a>), still improving passively by scaling through hardware and actively through development.</li>\n<li>Usable as an method of exchange (i.e. directly spendable) - that  means that early whales won&#39;t all have to &quot;cash out&quot; to take profits,  they really could use it for goods/services directly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I understand that these are lofty claims, and that they sound unbelievable. However, all of these can be verified either through the <a href=\"https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/\">Nano protocol/website</a> or through links I&#39;ve added. A more practical approach would be to verify the low latency, feelessness and great user experience for yourself by taking two minutes to try it out.</p>\n\n<h1>How to try out Nano</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install Natrium (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.banano.natriumwallet\">Android here</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/natrium/id1451425707?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">iOS here</a>).</li>\n<li>Visit a <a href=\"https://nano-faucet.org/\">Nano Faucet</a>.</li>\n<li>Fill in your Nano_ address and hit send.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all! To really try it out I&#39;d recommend getting a second wallet such as <a href=\"https://nault.cc/\">Nault (web-based)</a> or Nalli (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.heimo.nalli\">Android here</a>,<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1515601975\"> iOS here</a>),  then sending some Nano from your first wallet to the second.</p>\n\n<p>I think trying it out is the single best way to experience the user experience/speed that we Nano enthusiasts are always raving about. I also believe that, given that it takes just two minutes, it&#39;s worth taking some time out of your day to verify or disprove these claims that are so often made. I&#39;ve tried my fair share of cryptos and wallets, and I can tell you I have never seen a crypto-related user experience that can compete with using Natrium to send and receive NANO.</p>\n\n<p>If I&#39;m right, then Nano might be an incredible opportunity. If I&#39;m wrong, then you can discount these Nano claims from now on and save yourself a lot of time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wait, people are giving Nano away for free?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, many people are just <strong>that</strong> enthusiastic about Nano. I think that practically everyone here on <a href=\"/r/cc\">r/cc</a> can attest to the fact that Nano enthusiasts are a very big group, and a very active group.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dg3787bvaue61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab31fa3c87993bd114f9915543a7faca8dd64e58\">I couldn&#39;t resist adding this in here.</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not just <a href=\"/r/cc\">r/cc</a> though. A different crypto subreddit recently (literally) had their entire hot page filled with Nano posts, <a href=\"/r/nanocurrency\">r/nanocurrency</a> is an incredibly active subreddit, and even on other subreddits around Reddit you&#39;ll often run into Nano posts and comments. The same holds true for Twitter - Nano is consistently in the top 3 most talked about cryptocurrencies on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily though, it&#39;s not just a bunch of shills and enthusiasts. Nano also has a very large developer community around it building awesome stuff on Nano. The Natrium wallet was named before, but there&#39;s also a <a href=\"https://nault.cc/\">great web/desktop wallet in Nault</a>, the awesome <a href=\"https://nalli.app/\">Nalli wallet</a> that allows you to send Nano to anyone using their phone number, and even recently got <a href=\"https://kaiak.cc/\">the first cryptocurrency wallet for KaiOS</a>, the second largest mobile OS in India and many developing countries.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, there are Nano TipBots for practically every platform, such as for <a href=\"https://github.com/danhitchcock/nano_tipper_z\">Reddit</a>/<a href=\"https://nanotipbot.com/\">Twitter/Telegram</a>/<a href=\"https://thenanobot.com/\">Whatsapp</a>, and there is so much development happening that it&#39;s <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/kkgq8h/looking_back_on_a_year_of_nano_development/\">just too much to list in this post</a>. One more thing I&#39;d like to point out is <a href=\"https://wenano.net/\">WeNano</a>, a newer app that functions as a wallet and allows users to create hotspots that grant free Nano to others based on their location. It&#39;s like Pokemon Go, but then for crypto. WeNano has already exploded in use worldwide, especially in 3rd world countries where these undebaseable, self-sovereign currencies are needed most.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This all sounds pretty fantastic so.. why has the price been declining?</strong></p>\n\n<p>To be fair, the price has roughly quadrupled since a month ago. But it&#39;s true, Nano had a huge run-up in 2017 peaking at $30+ shortly. The bull market ended shortly thereafter, and Nano had a massive decline of nearly 99% over the next couple of years, not exactly helped by one of the two exchanges on which Nano was traded having a double withdraw bug + an exit-scamming exchange owner.</p>\n\n<p>Things have begun to change. NANO bottomed out with the rest of the crypto space, went through a healthy accumulation phase, and has since begun showing signs of life yet again. It&#39;s been going up a fair bit lately, and more importantly Nano is experiencing a massive increase in interest. It&#39;s actually the reason I&#39;ve been less active in <a href=\"/r/cc\">r/cc</a> - I literally cannot keep up with all the DMs, Discord messages, chats and questions elsewhere I get about Nano. This is no hard data, but I&#39;m pretty sure I alone have sent to over 300 newly opened wallets this past weekend because people wanted to try Nano out, and the faucets are seeing a surge in use as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what is the price upside here?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think I&#39;ve described well enough why this is exciting from the perspective of someone interested in the tech and wanting to have a global decentralised digital currency, but what is the price potential here? To be honest, I am loath to do price forecasts, so here are some reasons I think Nano will go up, strongly, in the near future, without having an idea as to how much this will be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exchanges.</strong> Nano recently got listed on some exchanges (BitcoinSuisse for institutional investors, AnchorUSD for a direct USD gateway + exchanges in Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia) but <em>still</em> isn&#39;t listed on <strong>Coinbase</strong>. The Nano team recently applied for the Coinbase listing and Coinbase just so happens to have removed pruning as a prerequisite from their website. This could be a coincidence, but it&#39;s positive either way. Additionally, in another showing of Nano&#39;s big community, the post requesting Nano be added to Coinbase is now the <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/l8lcwl/is_nano_cryptocurrency_planned_to_be_added_on/\">all-time most upvoted post</a> on <a href=\"/r/coinbase\">r/coinbase</a>. Plus, Garry Tan, one of the early investors is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1231029507638693889\">presumably still invested in Nano</a>. Another exchange that could list Nano is <strong>Gemini,</strong> and the good news here is that the twins have recently gotten more interested in Nano in the sense that they&#39;re liking Nano posts on Twitter. Thin proof, but it&#39;s something!</p>\n\n<p>The most hopium part of all is of course Elon Musk. His <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704\">least error &amp; latency</a> post combined with him looking into crypto makes me hope that he&#39;ll run across Nano and try it out. The Nano community has recently developed a knack for getting their posts in front of people they want to know about Nano (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1353531308748767234\">see also Raoul Pal</a>), and it&#39;s my hope this also gets the ultimate first principles engineer to give Nano a look <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mira_hurley/status/1356277209212858371\">through this tweetstorm.</a></p>\n\n<p>In essence, my thinking here - Nano has extremely good fundamentals, a large and enthusiastic (developer) community, a lot of price upside, hence is worth a look for anyone regardless of what got you into cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear what people here think, and if anyone has any questions about Nano I&#39;d love to answer them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
