The next highest score is Coinbase&#39;s at 8.8, which is a large gap.</p>\n\n<p>This makes me think they&#39;re adjusting the score weightings (which we don&#39;t know the details of) to push Binance higher in their rankings, if not outright making stuff up. And we don&#39;t know what other data they&#39;re fudging to favour Binance, either.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, CoinMarketCap is probably relatively accurate for most general information, but you can never <em>really</em> trust what you&#39;re seeing.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I would rather support CoinGecko, which even <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinoconnell/2020/06/17/as-binance-acquires-coinmarketcap-coingecko-pledges-independence/?sh=c1e3ad97d71b\">pledged to remain independent</a>, in spite of a bunch of offers by exchanges, after CoinMarketCap&#39;s acquisition was announced.</p>\n\n<p>And CoinMarketCap isn&#39;t the only crypto data aggregator with a conflict of interest - another example is CoinCap.io, which is owned by ShapeShift. It&#39;s unlikely to matter right now since ShapeShift isn&#39;t even being tracked by CoinCap.io, but what about if it grows large enough to be tracked by them in the future?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, always double check the source of your information! You don&#39;t want to miss important stuff just because Binance or another organization doesn&#39;t want you to see it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
