Last week&#39;s gains are gone, and you can choose to re-up the bags that you really believe in. </p>\n\n<p>If you started in February, the coin that was up 200% over the past 90 days is still up 25% and you&#39;re wondering, &quot;Do I hold, DCA, or lessen my exposure&quot;? </p>\n\n<p>If you started in March, you&#39;re upset that you were just getting things figured out. You&#39;ve narrowed your &quot;diversification&quot; down to 8 coins and they were all performing well. You worry about buying the dip, &quot;because it might be too late&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>If you started in April, you&#39;re pissed. You bought at ATH and watched a few weeks of gains get wiped out, because the guy on SNL won&#39;t shut his rich mouth up about crypto. You had just moved away from the couple of shitcoins, and grabbed a bag of energy efficient POS coins. You felt smart because going from shitcoin to an acronym of Piece Of Shit, is ironic. And, hey, Fate Loves Irony. </p>\n\n<p>If you started in May, you&#39;re realizing that pancakes are great for breakfast, but terrible for exiting a &quot;safe coin&quot;. You lost half your investment in the way to acquire 4,000,000,000 coins that can only be as safe as their namesake, right?? Now it&#39;s gonna cost the remaining amount just to cash out. The nominal amount of ETH that you have left has lost the $32 gains it received in the past 5 days.</p>\n\n<p>But here&#39;s the secret... The market will go back up. And back down again. It&#39;ll go sideways for a bit too. But the gains we missed by not investing in Dec 2020, or April 2018, or September 2013, will be in your future as well. There will be folks in 2025 that wished they started when you did. Enjoy the process. One of life&#39;s greatest lessons is not where you end up, it&#39;s what you become along the way. We&#39;re learning, we&#39;re growing, and we can&#39;t be stopped.</p>\n\n<p>May your bags overflow. 💰</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
