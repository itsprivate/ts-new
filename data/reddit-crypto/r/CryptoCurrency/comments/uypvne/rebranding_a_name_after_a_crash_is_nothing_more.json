But mark my words, I&amp;#39;ve been invested in this market going on 7 years, and I&amp;#39;ve literally and figuratively almost seen it all to a point I can sense when shit is about to stink really bad.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not know what is going to make me rich, but I am dam good at seeing what is not going to make me rich.   Luna isn&amp;#39;t one of them.    I&amp;#39;m sure it will go up and give some sense to people that there is still hope.  Hey, some may even be able to make 10x before it goes through it&amp;#39;s final crash shortly after but you can do the same thing with shitcoins.  So other than trying to time that risky market, you really aren&amp;#39;t going anywhere sticking around with Luna.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know die hard Luna fans don&amp;#39;t want to hear it but\nIt&amp;#39;s a nose hair away from reaching official shitcoin status.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
