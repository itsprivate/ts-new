They don&amp;#39;t spend time on reddit. They don&amp;#39;t follow any influencers. They don&amp;#39;t use Twitter, YT etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We always talk about how we shouldn&amp;#39;t be introducing family or friends inco crypto. And I always avoided it, the only person I&amp;#39;ve talked to about is my wife for obvious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never mentioned investing her own money. But my wife was very adamant to buy some crypto for her and she basically told me: &amp;quot;tell me when it doubled&amp;quot; uhm... OK honey. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s what I did. She gave me cash, I bought some crypto for her and let it sit, she never talked about it again, she never asked, she never mentioned any news etc. and it was in the middle of the bull run. Anyway, it increased by 100% in few months and I told her about it. And she was like &amp;quot;great now sell it, sell it all&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;m like whelp, OK. She took the money and we never spoke about it again, it was incredible. She had a plan to double the money and then cash out. She forgot about it for a long time. And because she only invested what she could afford to lose she was never woried. To her that money was basically burned and forgotten. She didn&amp;#39;t want 5x or 10x or 100x it, she simply doubled it and that&amp;#39;s it. She had a clear target. I think one of the reasons why she was so calm about it was simply because she never followed any news. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people here would benefit with similar approach to investing. As long as they invest only what they can really afford to lose in case if things go south.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
