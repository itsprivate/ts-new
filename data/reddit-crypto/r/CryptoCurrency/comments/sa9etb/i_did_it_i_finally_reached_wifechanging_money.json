I would check the charts constantly, always reading whitepapers, and when ever I visited the in-laws all I would do is babble on about crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my wife didn’t like any of this, but she was happy to deal with it because I would always reassure her that crypto was our ticket to financial freedom and that it was important for me to invest my time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the prices first started dipping after ATHs of Q4 2021 I was sure we had reached the bottom, so being the crypto guru that I am I remortgaged our home and went all in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a couple of more months, I have seen immediate success. I got home from work to find my wife and kids gone, as well as divorce papers on the kitchen counter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people seem to think you only get wife-changing money by being in the green, turns out seas of red can bring it about too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
