All of that privacy jargon is cool and all, but I just heard Gas will hit $10 by EOY in California which means it will be close to $7 on the east coast.     My taxes on a regular home went up 30% in two years, 2 slices of pizza, and a drink come out to $10, and now the town decided it was the perfect idea to TRIPLE OUR WATER BILL! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YES, they actually tripled it.   Turns out the previous mayor didn&amp;#39;t pay the water bill from the other city we get water from for like 8 years!.    Great that I have to pay for the previous home owner&amp;#39;s water bill.  Why not right?    But the absolute worst thing about what we are going through right now is the idea that &amp;quot;crypto is the problem&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s being used as one of the scape goats in the Ukraine/Russia war.   God, people are so FKing stupid to believe this shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more we change, the more we stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
