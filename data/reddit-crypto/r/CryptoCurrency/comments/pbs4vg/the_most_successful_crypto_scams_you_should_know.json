It’s a completely worthless cryptocurreny. The intention is to make the user believe they were lucky by receiving an airdrop or accidental transaction. They are then directed to a website to withdraw/sell the funds by targeting private keys or identities.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Don’t</strong> visit or login to any website that is behind the token.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Don’t</strong> try to move the token it’ll just cost you unnecessary gas fees. </p></li>\n<li><p>Just <strong>simply ignore it</strong>. (some wallets have the feature to hide tokens)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>The Ethereum Comment Scam</strong></h1>\n\n<p>Mostly in Twitter, Instagram and Reddit comment sections, accounts act dumb and post their private key for someone to help them exchange a small amount of for example Dogecoin to another cryptocurrency. </p>\n\n<p>The intention is to make users log into the wallet to grab funds from a suspected crypto noobie. When they log in they will discover a ERC20/BSC token that is apparently worth some hundred dollars. You’ll need to send a specific amount of Ethereum for gas fees to extract the coins. Once the Ethereum arrives in the wallet a bot will steal the amount and send it to the scammers private wallet.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For this scam simply stick to the rule: <strong>if it’s too good to be true it’s too good to be true.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>The Rugpull Scam</strong></h1>\n\n<p>Most users will brand this simply as a shitcoin gone wrong but it’s not. If you think you found a new gem on the cryptocurrency horizon it’s most likely a scam. — Don’t fall for fancy graphics, tokenomics and hype. Most of these ERC20 and BSC tokens are set up to inflate the price with pre-sales. Once a decent amount of normal users bought in, the scammers will empty the liquidity pool in a short amout of time by dumping their wallets which will result in the price collapsing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Don’t</strong> listen to celebrities and influencers for crypto investment advice.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Do your own research.</strong> Why is a specific cryptocurrency valuable, does it solve any problems or provide solutions or is it just hype with no fundamentals?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>The Exit Scam</strong></h1>\n\n<p>Thodex and Africrypt are just two examples of companies committing an exit scam and running away with billions in users funds.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Don’t</strong> use new, small and unestablished crypto companies and exchanges. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Don’t</strong> store crypto on any exchange long term.</p></li>\n<li><p>Get a hardware or software wallet that gives you control over your private keys.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>STAY SAFE Y’ALL!</strong></h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
