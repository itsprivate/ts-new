  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitepaper is here: &lt;a href=\"https://crypto.com/images/crypto_com_whitepaper.pdf\"&gt;https://crypto.com/images/crypto_com_whitepaper.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, let me start by stating that I am a CRO holder and have been bullish on this coin for a looong time (&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qia3ri/lets_talk_about_cro_and_why_its_still_underpriced/\"&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qia3ri/lets_talk_about_cro_and_why_its_still_underpriced/&lt;/a&gt;). First because it was undervalued and underappreciated and second because the roadmap/Whitepaper that CDC published is extremely coherent, ambitious and sets out what I believe is a clear and plausible path to not only mass adoption, but wide-ranging utilisation of crypto in general – CRO or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More importantly, much of what was set out in the Whitepaper has already been achieved, which demonstrates that CDC are firmly on track and that their stated goals are not only plausible but probable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;eg: The VISA, Formula One, UFC, SERIE A, PSG and CONMEBOL partnerships, The NFT Marketplace, Cronos Mainnet, Draco - Phase II of the Crypto.org Chain, The Crypto.org Chain Desktop Wallet (separate from the DeFi Wallet) and of course the Crypto.com Arena.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The section covering payment is an interesting one. It seems that the medium to long term goal is to make CRO have as much real-world utility as possible – hence Pay Checkout, the ability to directly purchase AirTime and Giftcards and to be able to send to friends through the app. Whilst CDC may not (yet) hold a banking license, it seems highly likely that Coinbase or CDC will be the first crypto exchange to diversify into traditional finance. That would also explain the recent acquisitions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘CDC agreed to acquire the North American Derivatives Exchange Inc. (Nadex) and IG’s nearly 40% stake in the Small Exchange Inc. for $216 million in cash, according to a statement from IG Group. IG Group shares rose as much as 1.8% in London. The Small Exchange, which is based in Chicago and counts Citadel Securities, Jump Capital, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and Peak6 Investments among its investors, recently added crypto-related futures to its product list. Nadex is a U.S. derivatives exchange for products including binary options and call spreads, and is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road to mass adoption of Crypto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Leveraging the Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet creation growth forecast, and discounting users with multiple wallets as well as overlap between each blockchain wallets, we expect crypto users to grow to 250 to 400 million by 2022’&lt;/em&gt; (Page 27)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the higher figure of the above is realised, then crypto adoption would have reached 5% by 2022. Given that figure would leave lack of adoption at a staggering 95%, the potential for &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; crypto to gain mass adoption at the 25% mark is clear to see. If 50% global adoption can be reached by the late 2030s or early 2040s, any early crypto payment solution providers are going to be as ubiquitous as VISA, Mastercard, AMEX, Apple, Amazon or Google.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may sound extremely ambitious, but for those who are curious about what the future holds for crypto as a future global payments’ solution, this paper by The Economist is a fascinating read: &lt;a href=\"https://digitalcurrency.economist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digimentality-Crypto-EIU-Final2-1.pdf\"&gt;https://digitalcurrency.economist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digimentality-Crypto-EIU-Final2-1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Crypto.com Arena&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This monumental deal has been widely publicised, but there is so much potential to utilise crypto in a real world scenario that we should all be bullish on how much it’s going to change. Forget about the branding and think about Crypto.com Arena Ticketing as NTFs or the (hopefully discounted) ability to pay with CRO for tickets, merchandise and food and beverages in the area, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems CDC has realised that mass adoption is also going to rely on education as well as utilisation and this snippet from the LA Times would tend to support the above:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Visitors will see one clear change at the entrance to the arena from L.A. Live, adjacent to the statue of Magic Johnson, where 3,300 square feet will become a dedicated Crypto.com “activation space” featuring crypto-centric interactive experiences for sports or music fans. Crypto.com has also signed with the Lakers and Kings as their official crypto partner.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples\"&gt;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mass adoption of crypto as an alternative to fiat payments is going to depend on three factors:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;· Accessibility (how easy is it to pay with crypto)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;· Incentive (why would anyone choose to pay with crypto)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;· Integration (the eventual ability to see traditional fiat and stablecoin / crypto balances in the same app)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those key reasons as well as other factors mentioned above, I believe Crypto.com is positioned to change not only the way that crypto is perceived (first step to mass adoption), but the way that crypto is utilised (actual mass adoption).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
