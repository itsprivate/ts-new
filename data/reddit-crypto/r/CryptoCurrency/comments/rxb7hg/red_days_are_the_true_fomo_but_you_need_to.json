This is even more true during red days. The opportunity seems very good but you never know the bottom of the dip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please act rationally and not with your emotions. DCAing doesn&amp;#39;t mean throwing money at dips in hope that the market goes back up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to buy every dip, in the end consistency is more rewarded. Good luck out there!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
