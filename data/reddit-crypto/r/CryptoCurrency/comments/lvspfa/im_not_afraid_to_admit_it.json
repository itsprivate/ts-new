Even before lockdowns.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m 100% Pro decentralization of the internet.</p>\n\n<p>I got FOMO&#39;d into crypto late 2016, started out very modest with XRP, did good, got my little pot of gold, and I&#39;ve been messing around since trying to reach the moon. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want 50K or 100K more.   No.  I obviously want much more than that. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking for a cool $500,000+ after tax, and thats my only purpose holding.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m waiting for my ticket 🎫. I strongly feel it will come within good time.  Just waiting for my holdings to hit that 10x mark.  I understand not all  my holdings will go that route. After all, I have really heavy bags from 2017.  Especially APPC.   But a few others that have paid off during this boom.  Then I plan to compile them into 1 or 2 then watch that go up 5x more again. </p>\n\n<p>Nobody should be ashamed to admit that&#39;s what they want, and history shows you can get that by simply holding. Although not gaurantreed you specifically will. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone who held BTC through the gain, and crash and back up to 50K is sitting good.   Anyone who dumped into neo when it was super low last year is doing golden.    Same with many other alts.</p>\n\n<p>So be proud of your goals.  We are in very tough times, and crypto saved my ass.  I&#39;d be worse off without it.   Business is stupid slow.     </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust Fiat 💵</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust banking 🏦</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust politicians no matter which way they float.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust the media</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust centralized conglomerates like FB, Twitter, youtube google</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust large corporations to have my best interest in mind</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust medication</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust police</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t even trust all my neighbors</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust the school system to educate my kids properly.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t trust my taxes are being spent the right way.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s sad , I, you everyone has every single legitimate reason not to trust this list.  </p>\n\n<p>I can however trust decentralized dapps not run by any one person. </p>\n\n<p>I can trust bitcoin won&#39;t break into my home and take my kids away. </p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t feed me propaganda</p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t sell my information</p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t judge me based off\n my credit score</p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t judge me based off my political, religious beliefs, or the color of my mixed race skin.</p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t censor me.</p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t try to take my rights away for more security.</p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t spam me. </p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t force me to stay home.</p>\n\n<p>I can trust it won&#39;t trick me into taking meds not good for me. </p>\n\n<p>I can trust bitcoin won&#39;t taint my food with dangerous additives. </p>\n\n<p>I can trust bitcoin won&#39;t taint my water supply with led. </p>\n\n<p>And last but not least...</p>\n\n<p>I can trust Bitcoin won&#39;t make me click yes to a 1000 page agreement written in Dog Latin that is just a really long way of telling me rules will get changed to anything at anytime without any reason without my consent and there is nothing I can do about it...if I want to keep using it.</p>\n\n<p>I can trust that someone will accept my bitcoins as long as we still have electricity. </p>\n\n<p>It wouldn&#39;t matter if we lost our electricity , everything is Fked at that point.</p>\n\n<p>So why not?  I&#39;m riding this till it&#39;s end, or till my end.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
