The Reddit devs were too slow &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; This works much better as an April Fools idea &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One day there will be a post here that will make me say, &amp;quot;oh good, I can see me actually using this new feature ever.&amp;quot; That day is not today.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noone wants this. First the post about the video player and now this bs is the thing you worry about apparently. Are you serious? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;saved the best for last&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This feels like one of those things where in a few months there will be an update post where Reddit Admins are apologizing for ‘missing the mark’, and telling us ‘we hear you’ when they announce its going away.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NFTs are cancer, even if you go out of your way to not say the word NFT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so I personally like the one I bought (first NFT I&amp;#39;ve bought) but the non crypto general population on reddit seam to really hate the idea of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
