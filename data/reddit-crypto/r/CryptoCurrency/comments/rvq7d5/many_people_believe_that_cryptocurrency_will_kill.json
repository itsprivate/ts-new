They became the religious ruling elite, which evolved into the privately owned and government-subsidized enterprises that we see now today. And as we all know, banks have monopolies over people&amp;#39;s money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#39;re doing a great job at it too. This is a record profit every year, paid for with your money. Banks have unlimited cash at their disposal. Nobody is a crypto expert, but everyone has money in a bank, and it&amp;#39;s generating bank record profits quarter after quarter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, crypto is providing people with a new source of income. Banks despise this since it has a direct impact on their company, affects their enormous monopoly, and reduces their profit margins, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency and DeFi are not intended to destabilize existing banking, but rather to drive banks and established financial institutions to adapt and compete in an ever changing market. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can assist banks in escaping the dark ages, dismantling monopolies, and attaining financial independence and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, Banks will never go out of business. Cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the way banks work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
