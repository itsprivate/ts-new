And today, one of Canada&amp;#39;s largest auditing and verification firms announced that they have purchased BTC and ETH for the first time ever!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The firm, KPMG, is a major player in Canada. It&amp;#39;s been around for more than 150 years and employs nearly 8,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what they had to say : &amp;quot;Investors such as hedge funds and family offices to large insurers and pension funds &lt;strong&gt;are increasingly gaining exposure to cryptoassets&lt;/strong&gt; (...). This investment reflects our belief that &lt;strong&gt;institutional adoption of cryptoassets and blockchain technology will continue to grow&lt;/strong&gt; and become a regular part of the asset mix.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, this news is absolutely a bullish sign. No matter what the haters and no-coiners think, crypto is here to stay, and this kind of news proves it. Institutions have only just set foot in it: we are still very early! Just think about it : if you hold long enough, you will probably end up selling your tokens to Wall Street big boys in a few years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are, indeed, all gonna make it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
