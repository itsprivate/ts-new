This is a warning to those of you who may have used the &quot;Buy Crypto&quot; button on <a href=\"https://Binance.us\">Binance.us</a> </p>\n\n<p>I attempted to make a purchase last night using the &quot;Buy Crypto&quot; button because it seemed easy. It returned an error four times with a red X that said &quot;Error, please try again&quot;. On the fifth attempt, I was brought to the confirmation page. I went to my email to check the success and lo and behold I had received five success emails, costing me $1750 when I received a confirmation for a single purchase. I reached out to Binance and was auto-filed as a &quot;Bug Report&quot; and I received the automated message. I then made a post to the Binance subreddit and received a response from a Binance US employee pretty quickly. I gave him my ticket number and received this as a reply to my ticket:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi-  </p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re sorry, fixes for that have been in the works. <br/>\nThe only solution I have for now is to withdraw the extra USD when the deposit limit time is up. I&#39;ll double check if there is any other possible solution here. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, Binance is actually <em>well aware</em> that the &quot;Buy Crypto&quot; button can &quot;accidentally&quot; charge people when it says it didn&#39;t work. There&#39;s no warning. There&#39;s no &quot;this might actually spend your money when it says it didn&#39;t&quot; message. In fact, if it weren&#39;t for me checking my email immediately, I could be sitting on thousands of dollars worth of crypto and have <em>no idea</em>. If the price goes up, well that&#39;s great, but if it goes down? Well, you just lost a bunch of money and guess what, you <strong><em>still can&#39;t withdraw it</em></strong> until the withdrawal lock is lifted.</p>\n\n<p>I can foot this bill, but I&#39;m a little peeved that Binance <em>knows</em> about this and still just lets people fall victim to it. That seems like it should be illegal, no?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
