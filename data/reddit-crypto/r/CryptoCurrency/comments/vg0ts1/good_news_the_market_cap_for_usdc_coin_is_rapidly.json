So USDC coin is within roughly &lt;strong&gt;$13 billion&lt;/strong&gt; away from unseating it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all the uncertainty and misery right now, the last thing we would need is a total Tether collapse, so it‚Äôs terrific to see USDC more widely utilized. Hopefully we can have a smooth fade away from Tether, rather than a ‚Äúrip the bandaid‚Äù period that could be much more destructive to the crypto environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just some good news for you in a sea of red üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: market cap difference&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
