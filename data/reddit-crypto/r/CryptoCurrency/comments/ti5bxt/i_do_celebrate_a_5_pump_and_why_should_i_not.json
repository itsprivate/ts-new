That would be trying to use one light particle to predict the site of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some people as me are just celebrating it because its naturally making us happy. We already know that in the long term there done day will be a new ATH and till then we will celebrate every step that brings us there. That does not mean that we are unaware of the current bearish situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s is nothing bad about having fun to see even the smallest pump as long as you don&amp;#39;t become illusive and use that pump to justify a moon shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
