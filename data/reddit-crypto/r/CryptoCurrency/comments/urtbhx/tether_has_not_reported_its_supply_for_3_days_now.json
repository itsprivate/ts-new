The only reason why would they do that is because their supply fell significantly in these 3 days and they don&amp;#39;t want more people to follow. If they didn&amp;#39;t hide the 8B that dropped during 5 days, how much are they hiding from these 3 days?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tether is getting more and more shady with everyday. They will probably try to buy back some of the withdrawn Tether with their reserves, decreasing their actual reserves and shooting themselves in the foot further. Of course Tether collapsing is not a good thing, many people will lose their money and a crypto crash will follow. Under any circumstances, don&amp;#39;t hold Tether.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
