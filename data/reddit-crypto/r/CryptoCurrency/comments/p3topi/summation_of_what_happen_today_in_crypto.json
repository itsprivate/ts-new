They say the advantage is that the inflationary effect is largely nullified.&quot;</li>\n<li>Fernandez tempered his interest in cryptoassets like bitcoin as potential inflation hedges with a healthy dose of caution, &quot;It is a global debate, and I must confess that it is a topic [that I approach with] caution. In my case, there is caution because of how unfamiliar it is, and because it is hard to understand how this fortune materializes. Many people in the world have these concerns, and that is why the project, or the system, has not yet expanded [more than it has].
