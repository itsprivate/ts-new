Yes, for example on July 21st, 2021 BTC went below 30k and was lower than now - but even at that point BTC was much higher than on July 21st, 2020 (a year earlier), when it was at 9k&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got into crypto in late 2020. During that whole time, whether BTC was up or down in the past days or weeks, you could always &amp;quot;zoom out&amp;quot;, look at the prices a year ago and see that it was still up a ton compared to then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time since I got into crypto, this is not the case anymore. At the time I write this, BTC is down 1.5% compared to a year ago, compared to Coingecko. So I got curious: when was the last time BTC was down from a year earlier? So I got the data and looked into how BTC opening prices changed to a year earlier every day since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer the question: &lt;strong&gt;September 14th, 2020,&lt;/strong&gt; when it was very closely below where it was a year earlier. The last time it was lower than a year earlier for more than a few scattered days was June to July 2020, the last time it was consistently down a lot compared to a year earlier for a long time was in early 2019. &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/BfBfXWu\"&gt;Here is the data for the past 3 years in an ugly graph&lt;/a&gt;, you can see it was up for the vast majority of the time and was more than 1,000% up in March 2021 compared to March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Widening the time frame, &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/9BxCR52\"&gt;here you can see the whole time frame I analyzed&lt;/a&gt;, and, not very surprisingly, BTC has also been up compared to a year earlier for the vast majority of the time as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some more fun facts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BTC was up 8,671% from a year earlier on November 30th, 2013&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BTC was down 90% from a year earlier on January 16th, 2019&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;during the whole time frame, BTC was up compared to a year earlier for 2634 days and down for 627 days&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the longest timeframe BTC was continuously up compared to a year earlier was from December 6th, 2015 to October 31st, 2018 (1,060 days)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the longest timeframe BTC was continuously down compared to a year earlier was from November 16th, 2014 to November 2nd, 2015 (351 days)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please ask!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
