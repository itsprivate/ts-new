This is really something if you believe that BTC will reach great heights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are people saying BTC will eventually hit 1 million. I am not saying it will or it will not, that is another post for itself. All I know is it will go up. That 0.28 stash of yours will increase its own value data by day (in the grand scheme of things). I do not have that much BTC yet but I plan to join the 0.28 BTC group eventually. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine years down the line all millionaires would want to own a BTC and there are not enough to pass around. Your 0.28 BTC value will skyrocket when it happens. So keep staking and lend out your BTC too to let your BTC make more BTC for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That will be all folks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
