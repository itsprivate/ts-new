Its renouned worldwide . Bottles  of wine start at $500. All that to say that the food should be amazing.  Only for you to be served chicken tendies and soggy fries from the kids  menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You look around then down at your plate. &amp;quot;I thought this was supposed to be good?&amp;quot; You think to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here comes your buddy, the guy who invited you to the restaurant. (Put in his entire life savings in at $0.35)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Told you this place is the shit bro.&amp;quot; Your buddy says as he sits down and is served a TV dinner from Banquet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh  yeah the food isn&amp;#39;t great... right now. But wait until later trust me  bro.&amp;quot; He says as he starts to unwrap the plastic film with a big grin on  his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as you were about  to take a bite of your tendie Allincrypto sits down at your table. &amp;quot;Sup  boys, Allincrypto here.&amp;quot; Then immediately takes a bite of a turd Charles  Hoskinsin layed on his plate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my favorite!&amp;quot; He says as he leans forward and eats the log apple bobbing style with no hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t think about your food now. Think about the filet mignon of tomorrow.&amp;quot; As he goes in for another bite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disgusted,  you look out the window at a run down diner across the street. You peer  into the window and see families laughing and having a good time. You  see the waitress walk over to the table with what looks like a bacon  cheeseburger and a new york strip steak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wow that looks pretty good.&amp;quot; You mutter to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as you say that Allincrypto and your buddy surround you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That place is so shit.&amp;quot; They say in unison as they both proceed to shut the curtains from each side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right before the curtains fully close you look up at the neon sign above the diner. It reads &amp;quot;Ethereum diner&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You turn around and stand up. Everyone in the restaurant has stopped eating and is glaring at you in complete silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;quot; they start chanting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all get up and start to surround you while still chanting &amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman shouts from the back, &amp;quot;Hydra will save us! Kill the non believer!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Im  sorry! I will eat my tendie please don&amp;#39;t hurt me! That place across the  street sucks.&amp;quot; But it doesn&amp;#39;t work and they proceed towards you slowly.  You shut your eyes and prepare for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You suddenly wake up in your bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Omg it was a dream. Thank god.&amp;quot; You think to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You pull out your phone to look at your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$10,000 bought at $2.68. Portfolio down 69.420%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You  walk over to the bathroom and catch a glimpse of yourself in the  mirror. You smile with a tear rolling down your cheek. You notice your  teeth are smeared with shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t have it any other way.&amp;quot; You think to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You proceed to go on Reddit to post about the new Solana outage and check what new features are coming soon to Cardano.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You look right into the camera. After a long pause you smile and shout &amp;quot;Hail Hydra&amp;quot; at the top of your lungs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The  camera zooms away from your face and out of your RV thats parked in  front of your step dads house and the credits start rolling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fin&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
