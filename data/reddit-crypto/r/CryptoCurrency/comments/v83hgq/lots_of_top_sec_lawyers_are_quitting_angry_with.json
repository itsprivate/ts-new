Also when the markets have taken a nosedive themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many more personal computer hours will $2.1 billion get SEC staffers? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the budget request, the agency said the number of litigated cases is expected to rise and that it wants more officials working on areas like environment, crypto-asset markets and cyber-related risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Article might be under paywall: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.law360.com/articles/1500034/frustration-hot-atty-market-drive-some-senior-exits-at-sec\"&gt;https://www.law360.com/articles/1500034/frustration-hot-atty-market-drive-some-senior-exits-at-sec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
