They could literally take your ID and sell them to identity thieves if they don’t use them themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second is that all of that information you supply can be used against you without a warrant. Of course, if you are not a criminal, you think you have nothing to worry about. But there are more instances than not of people being wrongly implicated in crimes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, people have to go through a lot of fucking shit to provide the necessary assets for KYC, and some people don’t have the means to do that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was definitely a lesson in DYOR for me. A total turnaround in viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
