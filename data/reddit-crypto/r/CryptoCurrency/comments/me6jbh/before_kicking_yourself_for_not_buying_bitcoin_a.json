You have a few DVDs to return to blockbuster.  All the news stations are talking about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  And you realize, holy crap, what year is this?   You grab a newspaper to check the date and suddenly realize, newspapers are still a thing!  You aren&#39;t dreaming.  This is real.  You know what you need to do.  You need Bitcoin.  All the Bitcoin.   Where does one even get Bitcoin in 2010?  Or should you mine it?  It&#39;s going to take a little research.  So you open a browser to start figuring this out.</p>\n\n<p>Good god, Yahoo! homepage, by default.  Anyway, you figure things out and begin to sink every penny into it.  Bitcoin is at 3 cents!   You sell everything you&#39;ve got.    You don&#39;t need your car, right?  Retirement accounts?  Screw it, it&#39;s worth the tax penalty.  Pokemon cards--actually maybe hang on to that one.  Once you&#39;re out of things to sell, it&#39;s time to start borrowing money from anyone and everyone you know.  They&#39;ll thank you later.  All the bitcoin.  You need all the bitcoin.  </p>\n\n<p>Until finally, the family stages an intervention:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let me get this straight.  You gave everything away?  Everything?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t give it away.  I bought a digital asset.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Can we see it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I mean... it doesn&#39;t exactly work that way.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;So you gave all your money to some &#39;Tasoshi&#39; guy on the internet?  Who is it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, we don&#39;t know WHO Satoshi is, that&#39;s not the point.  But no, I didn&#39;t give the money to him. I bought--&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Is this like, some kind of cult?  Did you join a cult?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m going to be the richest person on the planet.  You just have to wait a few years and--&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You think this guy on the internet invented money, and he sold it to you, for... all your money?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t say he invented money.  He invented a currency that doesn&#39;t rely on a central authority.  It&#39;s non-inflationary because you can--&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But you already told me you can make more of it with graphics cards.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes, but you can&#39;t make more forever.  It&#39;ll hit a hard-cap in 2140 and every four years they--&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;2140!?   What are you on?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>**FAST FORWARD A FEW YEARS*\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Honey!  What can we say.  You were right, we were wrong.  Bitcoin is at $10.  Sell it now and just think how rich you are!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sell at $10!?  Are you nuts?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What price are you waiting for?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t want this to lead to another intervention.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What like, $20?  $30?  Oh dear god, honey, please don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re holding out for it to go over $100.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
