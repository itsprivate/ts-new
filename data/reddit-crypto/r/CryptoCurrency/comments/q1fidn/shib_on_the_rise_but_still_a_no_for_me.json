The whole idea of meme coins has just become infuriating.</p>\n\n<p>Ive spent a lot of time on this sub learning about different projects, listening to pros and cons. It’s become really interesting to understand what projects do, what their utility is. Ive started to DCA into coins I believe in, ATOM, SOL, ETH, because I believe that regardless of market situations, their utility will help them continue growing. </p>\n\n<p>Meme coins feel like playing the lotto. A lot of people love the lotto. I never play. I feel pretty strongly that I’m meant to earn money and invest, but not just luck into riches. </p>\n\n<p>Again, congrats to anyone making money on any crypto, but I’ll stick to my utility based bag of coins. </p>\n\n<p>Rant over, thanks 🙏</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
