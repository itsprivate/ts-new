The network  officially went live in 2018 known as the Genesis block (the network has  upgraded 7 times since then and is currently on the Granada block) and  the native currency on the Tezos blockchain is the Tez (symbol: XTZ).  Expanded detail regarding on-chain governance, LPOS, Delegation.</p>\n\n<p>Tezos  was founded by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman (married) and the money  raised in the ICO was provided to the Tezos Foundation that is overseen  by a committee/board with a variety of cryptoindustry experts. The  Tezos Foundation helps oversee the Tezos ecosystem and part of the role  it plays is the issuance of grants to prospective new platforms and  protocols. The Tezos Foundation currently manages over $1.2 billion  which is used for grants, awareness, development, marketing, etc</p>\n\n<p>Valuation:  Figured I would cut straight to the juicy part first. I have found the  best way to value smart contract platforms would be a multiple of their  usage, which can be quantified by smart contract calls (“SCC”). Another  way you could value these platforms is applying a multiple of TVL across  the entire network, but those numbers are often inflated and not always  accurate. Below is a comparison of valuations for Ethereum and Tezos:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tugintdoqcr71.png?width=793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=614f231ec75eac803bf3627c71f7ea3b83f63628\">https://preview.redd.it/tugintdoqcr71.png?width=793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=614f231ec75eac803bf3627c71f7ea3b83f63628</a></p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at a higher multiple of smart   contract calls compared to Tezos. This makes sense given the fact that   Ethereum’s network is much larger than Tezos and has the most widespread   adoption. However, the growth in smart contract calls has slowed  across  Ethereum as seen in the chart below (Ethereum is currently at  ~3.2M SCC  per day):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/89drz6uxqcr71.png?width=1378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6091ce3ecc52d789189278870dc572d63da6b18b\">https://preview.redd.it/89drz6uxqcr71.png?width=1378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6091ce3ecc52d789189278870dc572d63da6b18b</a></p>\n\n<p>Tezos on the other hand is seeing exponential growth across the network   and is currently averaging ~190k smart contract calls per day:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3orbyth9rcr71.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d45b5a89197deb7a4919abcf1966bac5d4016d1b\">https://preview.redd.it/3orbyth9rcr71.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d45b5a89197deb7a4919abcf1966bac5d4016d1b</a></p>\n\n<p>Using a daily run-rate of 190k SCC per day, Tezos  in September reached 5.7M+ smart contract calls. Growing 35% monthly the remainder of 2021 will mean Tezos reaches 14M smart  contract  calls in the month of December.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As a result, by year end Tezos should theoretically be valued at $23.49 per Tez.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For   those who enjoy sensitivity tables, see below what Tezos could   theoretically be valued at across various monthly smart contract call   volumes and multiples. If you assume that there would be multiple   expansion from Tezos becoming a larger network with higher usage, the   valuation of $23.49 by year end 2021 at a 1.4x multiple looks extremely   conservative (again, Ethereum’s multiple of SCC is 3.2x):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t2rbymworcr71.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b19737585acb5877225795c1d9ad9d7fd131ea46\">https://preview.redd.it/t2rbymworcr71.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b19737585acb5877225795c1d9ad9d7fd131ea46</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this section out, below are  some interesting metrics on Tezos and Ethereum at the time of writing.  Ethereum Daily Transactions (1.2M): Ethereum Daily SCC (3.2M):  Tezos  Daily Transactions (667k, almost 60% of Ethereum&#39;s):  Tezos Daily SCC  (190k).</p>\n\n<p>Smart  Contract Calls: Interaction with a smart contract, for example,  initiating a “Harvest All” of farming rewards. Transactions: On chain  transactions, for example, after initiating a “Harvest All” for rewards,  if you are providing to liquidity to 3 different pairs then your  rewards will be sent to you in 3 separate transactions</p>\n\n<p>Why Tezos?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Secure Smart Contracts:</strong>   the process of formal verification, based on Michelson programming   language, provides the mathematical proof of the correctness of the   contract, that can be verified automatically. It is the golden standard   of &quot;trustless&quot; guarantee in a blockchain system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Participative Governance:</strong>  &quot;Bakers&quot; can submit and/or vote on a propose due to the very efficient  on-chain formal voting procedure.  By extension, all Tez holders can  express their opinion by delegating  their Tez to a Baker that shares  the same view on a given subject (to  consult the voting history of a  given baker, click on a baker from the then access the &quot;voting&quot; tab)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Proven Upgradeable Network without Forks:</strong>   Tezos’ formal on-chain governance model has already allowed for 7  (yes,  7) smooth, successful upgrades of the Tezos protocol and lets  Tezos  stay on top of innovation (Granada was the most recent upgrade:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g4fg5u4rrcr71.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d30b0182f16d90e1ae93d6689b0288810ef0c61\">https://preview.redd.it/g4fg5u4rrcr71.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d30b0182f16d90e1ae93d6689b0288810ef0c61</a></p>\n\n<p>This is a major advantage over other  blockchains and gives Tezos the  ability to quickly incorporate proven  features of other chains or innovate with proprietary upgrades  (liquidity baking: Additional notable upgrades include reduction of gas  fees and block times (now 30 seconds), TPS (now around 200).</p>\n\n<p>While   all this is great, what makes Tezos exciting is that there are always   additional network improvements on the horizon, specifically the   TenderBake upgrade coming sometime in Q4 2021/Q1 2022 will push that up   to 1000 TPS and near instant finality meaning block times will be 1   second or less.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Energy-efficient/Low gas fees:</strong> Tezos has been quoted at being <strong>8000x less expensive</strong>   and more energy efficient than its peer Ethereum. POS requires   significantly less energy than POW (which is part of the reason Ethereum   is looking to upgrade to ETH 2.0)</p>\n\n<p><strong>POS Staking and Deflationary Economics:</strong>   At each block, 80 new Tezos are created and distributed to the bakers   and then to respective delegators. Currently you can earn between 5%-6%   in rewards by staking your Tezos with a baker with ~80% of all Tezos   currently staked (you can delegate your Tezos to a baker through Ledger   Live, for example). You can also stake with centralized custodians such   as Coinbase, but as the saying goes “not your keys, not your coins”  and  they also take a hefty fee leaving you with closer to 4% returns.  The  big misconception with the POS concept is that many people confuse  Tezos  with being inflationary (they think in % terms) when in reality  the %  will decrease over time because it is based on the <strong>amount of Tezos created at each block</strong>,   which over time is divided by a larger Total Supply (i.e. Tezos is   deflationary). As many of you are aware, Ethereum is attempting to   switch to POS with ETH 2.0, so it is a similar concept but extremely   hard to implement without having to fork the network. In the last   section of this post, I provide an overview for beginners looking to   stake their Tezos and earn 5-6%, which is a safe and secure way to earn a   modest return.</p>\n\n<p>The recent  Granada proposal that went live at the  end of July added a new DEX  contract to the Tezos protocol between Tez  and tzBTC. This contract is  unique because the protocol itself creates  additional Tez at every  block (2.5) and adds them to the contract. This  incentivizes users to  provide liquidity to the contract in order to  capture a portion of the  subsidy (this added bonus to liquidity  providers is set to expire 6  months after the upgrade went, so it is not  permanent).</p>\n\n<p>I’m Intrigued, Where Do I Start?</p>\n\n<p>All  major CEX allow you to trade Tezos – if you’re looking for DEX/AMM I  would point you to Plenty  and Quipuswap . Kukai and Temple are great  wallets to use (similar to Metamask) that allow you to manage  your  Tezos and various FA1.2 and FA2 tokens (which are Tezos’  equivalent to  ERC20 / ERC 721 tokens, although FA2 has NFT capabilities  for example,  so it is not apples to apples). I typically link my Ledger  Nano to  Kukai which allows me to 1) view my Tezos and FA1.2/FA2 tokens  and 2)  interact with platforms such as Plenty to stake/farm/trade at  extremely  low gas fees (we are talking gas fees in USD pennies). If you  have  ERC20 tokens, you have the ability to WRAP those onto the Tezos  network  (examples include: wLINK, wAAVE, wWETH, wWBTC, wBUSD, wUSDC,  wMATIC,  etc.), you can actually do that on Bender Labs’ WRAP platform.  It is  extremely easy and is an efficient way to get 5 your tokens onto  the  Tezos network to start playing around with DeFi on Tezos and earn  high  interest from farming.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a  screencap of some (not  all) of the farming options offered by Plenty – I  encourage you to visit  their site and poke around. Right now, Plenty  offers high rewards in  the form of Plenty DAO, which is extremely  lucrative at the moment, and I  would recommend anyone looking to dip  their toes in DeFi to give this a  shot. APRs currently are in the high  300%-400% (these APRs are not  updated to reflect the temporary double  rewards that are shown in the  picture below so it is even higher at the  moment). You will be amazed at  how far less expensive it is to use  DeFi on Tezos versus Ethereum which  makes it more fun to interact with  (again, gas fees are pennies). Even  if you believe that Ethereum will  hold the throne in the realm long  term, you can still earn a  significant amount of Plenty and exchange it  over time to your favorite  ERC-20 tokens that are wrapped on Tezos, and  then unwrap them onto the  Ethereum network (although once you see the  fee difference between  Tezos and Ethereum you may not want to!).</p>\n\n<p>QuipuSwap   is also a great reliable DEX that is similar to Plenty. Personally, I   have found Plenty a bit easier to use and the rewards are better than   any other DEX built on Tezos (QuipuSwap does offer a few more trading   pairs at the moment). Again, providing liquidity has its risk of   impairment loss, but currently the reward potential seems to outweigh   that risk at least in the near term. APRs of 300%+ you should be yelling   sign me up!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/enl9ec6urcr71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff3313214e39c31a0e3fead7e56193425014a01e\">Additionally, Kolibri (LINK)  is a lending platform that you can borrow  kUSD with Tezos as collateral  (BTB has touched on this strategy before,  it is risky, but the same  concept applies to what you can do in  various ways on the Ethereum  network). There are various other DeFi  platforms that are listed in the  below Ecosystem chart that you can do  research on and play around with  as well.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Broader Tezos Ecosystem:</strong>  As you will  see below, the Tezos ecosystem is robust and flourishing  with many  different platforms and projects across a variety of buckets.  One recent  notable partnership that is noteworthy is the 6 launch of <strong>OneOf</strong>  ,  a green NFT platform built on Tezos that connects artists and fans  via  NFTs. This partnership highlights the focus on the “Green”/energy   efficient movement a lot of companies have and exemplifies that Tezos is   the perfect network for that (in addition to its other advantages).   Adoption of NFTs on Tezos have been exponential, those that currently   are in the space might be familiar with <strong>Hic Et Nunc</strong>  (which means &quot;here and now&quot;) which is the most popular NFT marketplace  on Tezos. For those looking to get into NFTs on Tezos, I would start  here.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qyapq76zrcr71.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60b871bd11d0366ca4c0cc9d598c75352cfaa015\">Another recent platform that just launched is Homebase (LINK),  a web  application that enables users to create and manage/use DAOs on  the  Tezos blockchain. This application aims to help empower community   members and developers to launch and participate in Tezos-based DAO’s.   An entire post can be written about DAO’s in general, but this   highlights the continued adoptability of Tezos as well as the various   ways smart contract platforms are disrupting society (in addition to   DeFi, NFTs, stablecoins, STOs, etc.).</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>But what about Solana/DOT/Cardano?</strong></p>\n\n<p>These   platforms do share (according to their white papers) some similar   characteristics to Tezos. One thing that makes them really stand out in   the broader market is the incredible amount of marketing that each   network and their teams have done. However, as many of you know, the   hype created around coins often outweighs the actual fundamental value   until the platform can actually prove out the concept and execute.   Marketing, roadmaps, and hype only end up working for so long unless   there is actual adoption of the network. At some point, these platforms   will either succeed or fall hard on their face. Tezos on the other hand   has taken a different approach over the past 3 years and instead  focused  on building out a strong ecosystem that has tangible widespread  use  (second to Ethereum as far as daily/monthly smart contract calls  which  is the main indicator of a smart contract network usage). Keep in  mind  that smart contract calls and transactions are two different  things and  are often times confused as being the same. The Tezos  strategy of  choosing to build out a network (first) and marketing  (second) has been a  point of contention within the Tezos community (the  contention being  the lack of marketing) which many people attribute  slow price/valuation  action, but the reality is Tezos is fully  functional while many other  smart contract networks are still a white  paper / roadmap with far less  adoption.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What  does that mean for you? You have the  potential to enter a fully  functioning smart contract platform that is  seeing exponential growth  at a steep relative value discount to where  these other peer networks  are trading.</strong> Cardano does not  currently have smart contract  capabilities (still a promise on the  roadmap and in the whitepaper).  Polkadot (copy pasta of ETH) is still in  its testnet phase. Solana  (copy pasta of ETH) is valued at $50B+ and  claims to have a functioning  network but can’t seem to provide public  smart contract call level  data. Tezos, in comparison, has a strong  fundamentally established  network, has proven its ability to upgrade the  network with its  self-amending protocol, high-profile partnerships,  exponential growth  via monthly smart contract calls (due to growth  across DeFi, NFTs,  Stablecoins, and STOs), and a solid decentralized  foundation / team. I  am not suggesting that these other networks won’t  also continue to see  success, but Tezos is a great investment  considering its development  over the past 3 years.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, of  the  many partnerships that Tezos has (for example, Red Bull Racing),  the one  with the New York Mets (and subsequent mainstage advertisement  in the  stadium each game) is no coincidence. A quick Google of who the  Mets  owner is should have you chomping at the bit</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quote:</strong> “<em>I   think we need a new term: Ethereum extenders. Because that is what  they  are doing. They all use the EVM and solidity. They copy paste  Ethereum  dapps. They inherit all the strengths and all the weaknesses  of  Ethereum. They are Ethereum.

Just like we have Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold,  and  Bitcoin Satoshi’s vision (not to mention all the other clones  without  Bitcoin in the name).
