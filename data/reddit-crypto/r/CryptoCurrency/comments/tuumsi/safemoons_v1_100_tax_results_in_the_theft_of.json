  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The dumbest mistake Safemoon made was thinking they could get away with theft on a public ledger.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rroftv/safemoon_giving_old_holders_mere_hours_warning/\"&gt;A catch up if necessary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On December 29th at 16:00 UTC, Safemoon implemented a 100% tax to discourage arbitrage trading, and announced this just 1.5 hours previously and only on limited social media channels.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you bought, sold or transferred Safemoon after this date&lt;/strong&gt;, your tokens were taken from you and sent to the Liquidity Pool, where they have since been &lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/token/0x9adc6fb78cefa07e13e9294f150c1e8c1dd566c0?a=0xcd198be08a33cbe2172f3be45cdb431e060076bc#tokenAnalytics\"&gt;withdrawn several times&lt;/a&gt; (Look at the big spike that started on December 29th, these vipers knew what they were doing and withdrew straight away).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The legality of this is still under review, and after ignoring it for months and months, the folks over at &lt;a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/SafemoonCase\"&gt;SafeMoonCase&lt;/a&gt; jumped on the back of an existing lawsuit for Safemoon (alleging a pump &amp;amp; dump scheme) and submitted a new class-action lawsuit, demanding Safemoon return the stolen tokens, and giving them the standard 14 days to respond. Safemoon did respond on the 13th day, but only with a generic &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re looking in to this&amp;quot;, with no indication of urgency, timescales or how it will happen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the blockchain is public and with a little sleuthing I have discovered an easy and verifiable way to tally up all of the stolen funds. And yes, I&amp;#39;m using &amp;quot;stolen&amp;quot; here because I believe that the act of ruthlessly taxing transactions at 100% constitutes theft.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, you find a site that will let you query the Binance Smart Chain. I found one that lets me query using SQL, which is a language I have some experience in. And now I&amp;#39;m going to show you how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we look at a simple &amp;quot;taxed&amp;quot; transaction hash, we get this:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0x3a67b4b12ae60ac6cbc6c18e58ff69499059ba5da111e7009560e6f5239f8758\"&gt;This transaction for 990 million Safemoon, worth approx $1,000 at time of transfer, was taxed 100%&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see the &amp;quot;output&amp;quot; of this wallet-to-wallet transaction was 0.0000001 Safemoon. To find the input is a little trickier, you need to look at the raw transaction data, which is this:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Function: transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)\n\nMethodID: 0xa9059cbb\n[0]:  000000000000000000000000c8ff694f4aed464e78123701b0c6cd6ef4b3b54c\n[1]:  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dbe14ef8f2d8773  \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See that second part of the bracket? The value is stored as a uint256 figure (Hex), so you need to convert it to Decimal, &lt;a href=\"https://codebeautify.org/hex-decimal-converter\"&gt;which is the second line (ending 8773)&lt;/a&gt;. You must input &amp;quot;dbe14ef8f2d8773&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This returns &lt;strong&gt;990251987199952800&lt;/strong&gt;, which is missing the decimal place. Divide it by 1000000000 (1 with 9 zeroes) and that finally returns 990251987.199952  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. The input of the transaction, or the Safemoon that was attempted to be sent, was 990,251,987, approximately $1,094, and the Safemoon Developers stole this by enacting an unethical 100% tax. You can get the transaction value &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/safemoon/historical-data/\"&gt;by looking at historical Safemoon V1 prices on CoinMarketCap&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we want to get &lt;strong&gt;EVERY&lt;/strong&gt; transaction that was stolen. That&amp;#39;s easy enough. You create a query that looks to get &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; transactions on the S&lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/token/0x8076c74c5e3f5852037f31ff0093eeb8c8add8d3\"&gt;afemoon V1 contract&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;AFTER&lt;/strong&gt; 2021-12-29 16:00, where the MethodID of the transaction is &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot; (this is people attempting to move Safemoon from one wallet to another), and where the transaction was successful (I.e, it didn&amp;#39;t fail due to low BNB for gas)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This gives us a whopping 44,718 lines. But 9,233 of these transactions were whitelisted and actually &lt;em&gt;not subject to the 100% tax!&lt;/em&gt; (It&amp;#39;s still unclear why so many wallets appear to be whitelisted)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;However, the other 35,485 transactions since the 29th December 2021 were taxed at a 100% rate, and here&amp;#39;s what Safemoon collected:&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;3.93 TRILLION Safemoon V1 tokens&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Worth approximately $6,309,371 at time of transfer&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got some more stats you may find interesting:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The largest amount of tokens taxed in one go was on the 7th March 2022 where &lt;strong&gt;over 210 BILLION tokens were taxed&lt;/strong&gt;, at an approximate value of $105,737. &lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0xd5822cfe0713a815ba2251e4a018321da9f9b81a3d3cd675f32d40ac5f5d9c03\"&gt;Here is the transaction.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The largest value of tokens taxed in one go was $171,337, where 85 BILLION tokens were taxed on the 31st December 2021, &lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf22e2e4ddddef9059b41ed51507178f7062c529c410600769f539e0277dbfbd2\"&gt;Happy New Years to that poor bastard&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;In just these two transactions, Safemoon developers stole over $277,000.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most tax taken in one day was from 3,090 different wallets, on the 31st December, worth 625 Billion Safemoon, valued at $1,259,035 - not bad for a day&amp;#39;s work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone want a reminder of the opinion of the Safemoon community to those who lost all their money via tax?&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s28y63/according_to_the_safemoon_army_if_you_do_not/\"&gt; Luckily, I documented it here&lt;/a&gt; so you can see what the &amp;quot;Safemoon Family&amp;quot; thinks about people who didn&amp;#39;t check every single facet of Social media before sending a fucking transaction.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the actions of both the Safemoon development team and the community that praises them and fiercely opposes all criticism is frankly disgusting.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;But wait, there&amp;#39;s more!&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;JUST&lt;/strong&gt; the &amp;quot;Transfer&amp;quot; transactions, I&amp;#39;m still yet to uncover purchases, sales or token swaps, which were also taxed at 100%. I will either update this post if I can figure it out tonight, or create a new one in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a closing statement, I just want to say that I hope the &lt;a href=\"https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-safemoon-llc-class-action-lawsuit.html\"&gt;Class Action Lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; fucks the Safemoon devs. This shit is worse than Bitconnect in my opinion, this is not just misleading investors (which they are due in court for), it&amp;#39;s straight up theft too. I hope jailtime is doled out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But even then I have my doubts that it will change the minds of the Safemoon faithful&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
