Jim Himes, buried around page 1,482 of the almost-3,000-page bill, that would allow the Treasury Department to bypass certain checks to take &lt;a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5318A\"&gt;“special measures”&lt;/a&gt; to surveil, condition or prohibit any transactions deemed of concern to U.S. interests. The provision, titled “Prohibitions or Conditions on Certain Transmittal of Funds,” also expands the department’s authority to include crypto exchanges and transactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contacts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\"&gt;https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm\"&gt;https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
