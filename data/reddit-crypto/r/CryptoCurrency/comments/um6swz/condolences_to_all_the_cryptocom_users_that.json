I know a lot of people that ended up switching over to this since it seemed the new best thing. Not even 2 weeks later this disaster happens and a stablecoin drops 30% with fears it won&amp;#39;t be able to re-peg back to $1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It must suck getting screwed over by cdc then going to anchor only to get screwed again 2 weeks later. My condolences üôè to you all. I know I almost was going to move my stablecoin stack over but knew 19.5% was not sustainable for long if everywhere was slashing rates so decided against it and just went to voyager and kept it in USDC. I didn&amp;#39;t expect udt to go the way it did, let alone this quickly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
