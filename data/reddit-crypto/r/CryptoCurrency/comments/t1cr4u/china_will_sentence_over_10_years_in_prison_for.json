Because they can&amp;#39;t control it. They are afraid of losing their power on their citizens. This is exactly what crypto is supposed to be, giving 100% control to people. Peer 2 peer. There is no middle man. There is no control freak authority. This is what decentralization is supposed to be and dictators hate that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a dictatorial country is trying to ban crypto, know that Crypto is on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No matter how much those dictators try to ban it, Crypto is INEVITABLE.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
