Every month new supply gets unlocked, increasing sell pressure. The coin itself doesn’t even sound that bad judging from reading about their tech, it’s just the distribution that’s disgusting. Sad to see a decent project getting ruined by greed.  I would expect the project to keep dipping just because it didn’t really proof itself and the vast amount of VC’s still being up dozens of “x”s.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: the ATH used is 700$ from CoinGecko, on some exchanges it’s lower and some way higher like on Binance (2800$). 700$ had decent volume, so imo that’s the correct ATH.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
