As a matter of fact as I am writing this market slowly going up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank lending requirements are tightening and that process will accelerate. This mean less and less money for risky investments. Don&amp;#39;t know how much institutional investment gonna change tho. And we little guys are mostly out of cash already. So there is that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If second quarter numbers look grim (at least worst than everyone predicted)in addition to rate hike it might push the market down further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of where market goes from here is same as stock market. it depends heavily on how well Feds can manage inflation. If fed rate hikes prove to be successful we might have better days ahead. If not...well it will not be only crypto which would go to doom spiral I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next few hours/days will tell us where we stand. I would not buy until I see a nice dive which might never come. Who knows!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now nothing new/game changing added to the picture. If situation keeps going like this I expect to see a relief rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
