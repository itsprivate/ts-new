However use case wise I’m not sure I see any at this point&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For ICP, I’m not quite sure why it entered on such a high valuation as well. However the decline has been Swift and steady. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would love to get the view of the community what were the worst rug pulls this year. Personally squid token was quite bad given how the creators just ran away with the money, but the amount was still in millions and not billions &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes wishing everyone a merry Christmas 🎄&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
