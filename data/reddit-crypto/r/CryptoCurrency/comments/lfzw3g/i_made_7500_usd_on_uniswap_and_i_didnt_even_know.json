I buy and sell all the time and I spend hours digging looking for new coins to buy. Last year I used uniswap to buy a token that was only available there. it was only one transaction and I didn’t really care much and totally forgot about the app. Fast forward to today , I decided to get back into crypto. I did some homework and found a couple good gems to buy on uniswap so I decide to open the app. </p>\n\n<p>I initiated  the transaction and I looked down to a button that says uniswap. I didn’t know what it was so I ignored it and my transaction failed. So I tried again and I was like meh I’ll just click it and see what it’s in it. </p>\n\n<p>As soon as I open it and I get the message “claim your 400 UNISWAP” and I was completely shocked. </p>\n\n<p>I owned the 400 from the airdrop since last year and I didn’t even know it!!!! And I rode it from 2 dollars all the way to 19.55 today! Imagine if I found out about it sooner I would’ve probably sold around 3 or 4 dollars (I know myself) but instead I rode it like a champ at a 524% increase ! Holy fucking shit. This just happened a few minutes ago and I thought this is the place to share such story</p>\n\n<p>Edit: earlier today my wife and I were stressing about our 1 bed room apartment since we have a baby coming on the way. We were planning to buy a house in August but this money will pull our date to may which will be perfect and right before our baby gets here! \nI am very grateful and I CANT WAIT to tell my wife in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>Edit2: my wife is getting a fat valentines gift</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
