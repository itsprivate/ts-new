Of course, I won&#39;t lie, the money mostly, but the idea of a decentralised financial world is appealing to me even if I don&#39;t fully understand it. I&#39;ve told him as well about some of the success stories on here with ADA, DOGE, and the like, as well as the rug pulls and my fuck up in May with futures (I lost enough to piss me off but not ruin me, s&#39;all good).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway he pipes up one day at work a month ago and states about the prices going down. This surprised me as I&#39;m the one always initiating conversation with him about it, bit I dived in and took a look. He asked me why I think it was happening but I just said I don&#39;t know as... well I don&#39;t, but threw out the old dead cat bounce or bulltrap just to sound like I had an inkling of an idea, but I won&#39;t lie, I was winging it. </p>\n\n<p>This moved on to him joking around about how my raise should&#39;ve been this month (August) instead of April, and that he hopes (for my sake) that the price continues on down until then. Of course, I agree. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;ve also been picking up a lot of slack. While I&#39;m not a developer, I have learned from watching and shadowing some basic shit in Linux and Windows servers so a lot of the daily checks and entry level stuff has been passed to me over the past 4 months as we&#39;re lacking engineers/developers.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today. Payday. I wasn&#39;t any more excited than any other day. I usually check my balance to make sure I&#39;ve been paid when making breakfast and a cuppa, so about an hour after waking up on payday.</p>\n\n<p>Before I have a chance to check my balance I get a Facebook message from my boss. &quot;There you go mate, hope that helps&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>....eh?</p>\n\n<p>I ignore it, boil the kettle and check my balance. I had an extra 200 quid in there. I was proper confused as I wasn&#39;t expecting any thing extra in there, and I know I was about £100 in my overdraft but I had £200 more than I was expecting. </p>\n\n<p>Not putting my bosses message together with the fact I got paid more I went to him asking if there was some kind of mistake or if payroll made a mistake...</p>\n\n<p>Nope, turns out given all the work I&#39;ve been doing, picking up slack for the other developers, my mistakes in futures but generally being interested in the crypto space, he said he pulled some strings to bring my raise up to this month <em>so I don&#39;t miss out if the prices of crypto do start going up again</em></p>\n\n<p>I mean I&#39;ve FOMO&#39;d before but I&#39;ve never had someone FOMO on my behalf FOR me.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s such a strange feeling to have someone believe in someone believing in something so much they give them money to get more of that thing. He doesn&#39;t invest though which makes it all the more beautifully weird he gave me a raise.</p>\n\n<p>I duno, it made me feel good.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
