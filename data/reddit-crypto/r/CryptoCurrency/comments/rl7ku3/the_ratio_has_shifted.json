It might be subjective, but I read less and less well thought out, informative posts / comments and a lot more simplistic, hype comments here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those who really want to inform themselves and have tech discussions seem to have migrated towards other subs (not all of course, you can still find it). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this an issue? You might make some moons off your (I like Coin x) comments, but you are going to lose parts of your competitive advantage vs the market, as information is going to become more and more asymmetric. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it is very important that the newcomers and hype people actually understand crypto beyond being an investment vehicle &amp;amp; get rich quick scheme in order to return towards having healthy debates from which we all benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
