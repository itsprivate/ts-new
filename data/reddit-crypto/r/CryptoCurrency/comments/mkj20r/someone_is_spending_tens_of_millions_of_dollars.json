They&#39;ve filed some patents but all of it entails some sort of probabilistic methods, nothing deterministic, ie by pretending to be a Monero node using timing and ip information they may be able to narrow down the suspected address to a few hundreds addresses only under very specific circumstances that rarely happens in the real world.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>XMR Price chart exhibits very unusual properties</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wv34xnshgcr61.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d7a1eb37d167d3f483b6d51e6d5f841cb0e4b44\">https://preview.redd.it/wv34xnshgcr61.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d7a1eb37d167d3f483b6d51e6d5f841cb0e4b44</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/xmrtrader/comments/mg95dt/xmr_volatility/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/xmrtrader/comments/mg95dt/xmr_volatility/</a></p>\n\n<p>it follows a very specific 24H retracement pattern. Some posits that there may be an inflation bug or an early whale liquidating his XMR holding, that would not make sense assuming the actor is rational and seeks to maximize gains. Why would any whale do this unless he aims not to profit but instead to suppress</p>\n\n<p>And there&#39;s this</p>\n\n<p><strong>SHORT INTEREST on Bitfinex</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mkwoyepigcr61.jpg?width=1094&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c7e5530b3d894b4f32660d2ba1e5f8945ed0f9\">https://preview.redd.it/mkwoyepigcr61.jpg?width=1094&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c7e5530b3d894b4f32660d2ba1e5f8945ed0f9</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/xmrtrader/comments/lg5a8i/is_xmr_the_most_shorted_coin_on_the_market/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/xmrtrader/comments/lg5a8i/is_xmr_the_most_shorted_coin_on_the_market/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://datamish.com/xmrusd/360d\">https://datamish.com/xmrusd/360d</a></p>\n\n<p>Comparing the short vs long ratio</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>SYMBOL</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>SHORT RATIO</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">XMR</td>\n<td align=\"left\">170%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">ZEC</td>\n<td align=\"left\">1.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">BTC</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">XRP</td>\n<td align=\"left\">2%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>On Bitfinex 34k XMR (170% of longs) are sold short, or about 8.5 MM USD at current prices. Unlike $GME,  crypto exchanges are not like the regulated securities exchanges, shorts don&#39;t need to Locate the borrow and there are no Failure to delivers report by the SEC. Thus if some crypto exchanges are colluding with the shorts, there won&#39;t be any margin call short squeeze, unless a significant number of people actually start withdrawing XMR from the exchange.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the recent Geopolitical instability in the caucus is actually bullish for XMR, as several Ukrainian elites have been known to stockpile it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ukrainian-politician-reported-owning-24-5m-xmr\">https://www.coindesk.com/ukrainian-politician-reported-owning-24-5m-xmr</a></p>\n\n<p>My take on this is that a group of people are buying time, trying to slow down XMR mass adoption, because unlike other cryptocurrencies it can not be easily co-opted into the current world power structure. Governments around the world would have to give up a large chunk of the control (and taxes) they currently enjoy if XMR becomes mainstream.</p>\n\n<p>I believe they would continue to do these attack until either of the following happens</p>\n\n<h1>They are able to crack or trace Monero transactions</h1>\n\n<h1>OR</h1>\n\n<h1>Monero adoption becomes so widespread that it makes continuing the attacks futile or prohibitively expensive</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
