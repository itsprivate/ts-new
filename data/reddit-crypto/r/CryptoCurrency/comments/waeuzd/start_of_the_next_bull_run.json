Aside from the great recession of 2008, they typically last around 8 months.  We had 2 quarters of negative GDP growth, but the economy is still solid.  I assume inflation will come down in the July CPI reading due to gas, some food, and new building construction costs coming down?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Powell said 100 basis point hikes are on the table, but I can&amp;#39;t see that a reality.  I think we get a 50 basis point hike when the fed returns from their vacation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With supply chains getting back on track, the democrats probably turning the money printers on heading into the mid terms (student loan cancellation?), and the federal reserve being more dovish, what stands in the way of the markets?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We still have the war in Ukraine, but all of that is already baked into the markets... any good news will be good news?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention everything going on with ETH, the next BTC halving, companies like Disney jumping into Matic...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto endured a war in Russia, COVID, major crypto like Luna going to 0, firms like 3AC and Celsisus, Voyager, etc all collapsing or having withdrawal issues.
