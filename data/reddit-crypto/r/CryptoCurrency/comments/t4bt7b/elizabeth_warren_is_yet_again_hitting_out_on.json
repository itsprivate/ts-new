Yet all evidence points to a democratic country Ukraine using and has received $20 million in crypto donations. Why not support whats going on instead of creating a non-story to spread FUD? Shame.",

  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Warren says crypto could be used to evade sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/acyupa6vrsk81.jpg?width=1184&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1402d66b989ee6048bec4f4ed100fe1a8bc28a17\"&gt;Cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against Russia, allowing Putin and his cronies to evade economic pain.  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except this is not whats happening, and on the contrary its Ukraine thats using crypto for good. Yet none of these Senators celebrate crypto for what its actually being used for, but instead create a non-story to serve their vested interests of slamming crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How pathetic could all of this get? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just wants an opportunity to somehow link it to hit out against crypto. Using her public and visible position to spread her own agenda when the country thats most affected by whats going on is actually  using crypto for the betterment of its people in the present terrible situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wqgx98gwssk81.jpg?width=1198&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=699dcd94d491efbe6d57968d1606ba9cbd1aea67\"&gt;Infact, just now Ukraine took up on Gavin Wood&amp;#39;s generous offer too. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And was able to find a bit of humor even in circumstances such as now..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: There are of course a possibility that this could happen, but as of now there is no evidence that it is happening. Nor is it likely in the future, infact Russia is more likely to use China&amp;#39;s SWIFT replacement known as CIPS - Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or use their own SWIFT replacement SPFS (less likely as low liquidity).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS&lt;/a&gt; - Russian Central Bank has already said SPFS could be an option, and 23 countries foreign banks are already connected to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USA is already the largest liquid crypto markets, if Russia starts accepting crypto for their strategically important export oil, they wont have any places to spend their crypto as the liquid USD-crypto market is already closed for them. Whats the point of earning say 10,000 crypto coins for a million barrels of oil, if they cant spend it anywhere due to lack of counterparties willing to trade with them? Russian Ruble - crypto pairs are non-existent today. Also, they cant use that crypto to buy commodities from other countries either, as these countries could come under risk of sanction themselves, and furthermore high volume crypto-commodity market is also non-existent right now. No country is going to be ready to start accepting say 10m  tonnes of Wheat for Crypto. Such a scenario is not even possible right now given the structure of crypto markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is why it is important for USA to actually build dominance in crypto markets, and yet you have people like Liz spinning up a&amp;quot;crypto is bad&amp;quot; narrative whenever they get the chance to do    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being afraid of Russia using crypto to evade sanctions is literally being scared of the boogeyman, especially when CIPS and SPFS offer much more immediate options for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
