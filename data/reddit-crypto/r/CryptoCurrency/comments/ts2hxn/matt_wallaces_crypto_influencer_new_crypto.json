  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Wallace a Dogecoin pumper created a token called “Accept Crypto” and shilled it to his supporters. A token with high trading fees which were supposed to go towards the cost of paying people to work towards getting businesses to accept crypto. It gets a lot worse…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He partnered with another guy Myles G that was previously in prison for &lt;a href=\"https://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/05/18/men-trick-woman-steal-her-rolex/\"&gt;fraud and robbery&lt;/a&gt; at gunpoint… (what could go wrong? SMH)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He initially tried to call it Accept Doge but The Dogecoin Foundation pulled their trademark card and stopped him from doing it on the threat of &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/billym2k/status/1506443665245413382?s=21&amp;amp;t=3gkaxm-DminXh7TsC9lomA\"&gt;legal action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dogecoin Community has been angry at Matt for weeks/months about this and other things as he is also a prominent Dogecoin Pumper that pushes unfounded rumors in his Twitter and YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time he’s done something like this, other tokens of his have also been rugpulled. &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/baby-lambo-inu/\"&gt;Baby Lambo Inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once trading started it acted as a honeypot, people could buy but couldn’t sell. A few short periods allowed trading as liquidity was drained. A total of $600K+ in ETH was drained from the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a recording of the Telegram call with his Patreon supporters right after they found out &lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-s1Q7ErBoBM\"&gt;they couldn’t sell and later exit liquidity was drained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allegedly it was supposed to be a fair launch but it went live for his patron supporters first and they were advocating in private channels to buy and dump on the greater market once it was live for everyone. [if this is true] instead they got hit with a honeypot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here a &lt;a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/03/26365071/dogecoin-influencer-matt-wallaces-exit-scam-costs-investors-600k-ethereum\"&gt;news article&lt;/a&gt; on it, it reiterates some of this but is limited in scope of background info.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
