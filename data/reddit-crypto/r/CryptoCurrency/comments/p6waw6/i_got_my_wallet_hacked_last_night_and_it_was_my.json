  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone… as the title shows, I had my MetaMask wallet hacked last night which had about $10k on it. This is not all my crypto, but a substantial bit and of course a lot of my pet projects, staking, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I had an issue staking a coin so I posted about it in the discord. A scammer messaged me and I totally fell for him. I was distracted doing other things around the house and wasn’t fully paying attention to the red flags. He sent me a link to “fix” my problem with my wallet and before I realized it was too late and my money was drained to his.</p>\n\n<p>Lessons:\nI am trying to justify this because otherwise I don’t know how I can survive the shame and embarrassment. This is what I’ve decided so far is important:</p>\n\n<p>1) Do not trust anyone online. Ever. For any reason. </p>\n\n<p>2) Do not put your money into projects that you don’t fully understand and are able to figure out yourself (ie know how to check ether scan on your own to verify transactions. This would have saved me)</p>\n\n<p>3) Make sure all of your passwords are written down in a physical piece of paper/journal. I’ve also been advised to buy a hardware wallet. </p>\n\n<p>4) Crypto is not life - but lately it’s taken over mine. It’s all I can talk about, all the context I consume, and I’ve even found myself withdrawing from other activities that used to make me happy because of this new obsession.</p>\n\n<p>I think the lesson for me her is time is more precious. The life I was wasting staring at price charts the last few months is worth way more than $10k and I want it back.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for letting me share here. I really had hoped when I woke up this morning that this was all a bad dream, but sadly it’s true. I’m sad that I’m so turned off by crypto right now after being so passionate about it on a daily basis. </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this is just a small lesson now preventing something worse later on. I also hope people learn how manipulative these scammers can be. Please be careful out there. Crypto can change your life for better and worse. Make it for the better xoxo</p>\n\n<p>Edit: here is the only screenshot I took. He has since deleted everything. When he asked for the key, I knew it was wrong but by that point I had already followed the link for him to “help” me. I think he was just trying to distract me while he drained my wallet. </p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/7DYvO9u\">https://imgur.com/a/7DYvO9u</a>)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
