Other than that, it is the same old story of &amp;quot;My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars&amp;quot;. The next time you see someone on some &amp;quot;Crypto rich list&amp;quot; or a guy flashing his Crypto gains, consider doing a little research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
