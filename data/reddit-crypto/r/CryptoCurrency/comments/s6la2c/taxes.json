Not only did I do that, I used mutiple exchanges and even more wallets. So my transaction count is quite high. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the real bear though. When you sit here and import everything into your coin tracker of choice (Koinly here), everything may not be there. I spent the last two days trying different platforms and importing API’s. Nothing seemed to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I keep records of everything and was able link everything up manually over about six hours. Needless to say, dont be me. Being more of a minimalist when it comes to exchanges and wallets is by far the way to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Fuck Uncle Sam and capital gains…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
