I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s not only me as most of the people entered crypto in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has its own strategy to handle the situation, for example I&amp;#39;m reading some positive posts here in the sub for my daily dose of Hopium. This is how i try to survive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to ask the more experienced users, the ones that have already survived several crashes back in the days, for advices for the newbies like me. How do you handle such volatile times, how do you keep yourself menially stable, what do you change in your daily routine to handle the losses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there is one single advice you should give to someone like me, what would it be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
