They have done this in the past and some allege they are attempting to manipulate the market. Regardless of the intent, this just shows us we should always keep an eye on the data and metrics so we are not caught off guard with where the market heads. Crypto quant, Glassnode, Whale Alert, Willy Woo and Plan B are all great sources to give you ideas on future market moves. There&#39;s no reason to be emotional and in shock when these things happen. The beauty of having a public ledger is we can all track these transactions. Please just keep this in mind going forward. We have the tools to see what&#39;s going on &quot;behind the scenes&quot;. Let&#39;s use them so we have better peace of mind in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you for the awards! </p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: PLEASE read the body and not just the headline. This isn&#39;t about blaming F2Pool, it&#39;s about letting people know we have tools to track transactions on the block chain so that we&#39;re not surprised by large market moves.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
