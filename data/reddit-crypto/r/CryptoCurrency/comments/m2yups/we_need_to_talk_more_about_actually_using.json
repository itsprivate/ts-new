Not only do they grow in value but can be used as a easier form of payment (among other things). You probably heard about they guy that bough pizza with bitcoin being an idiot, but he was using crypto to pay for something like it was design to do. I completely understand the investment side of cryptocurrencies and that is great but perhaps using it would bring more adoption and in the end increase value. I saw this <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bitcoin-dogecoin-btc-payment-cryptocurrency-news-hotel-chain-kessler-2021-3-1030174638\">news</a> today about Kessler Collection hotels accepting cryptos and about that the author said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>with many bitcoin investors preaching the message of &quot;HODL,&quot; which means holding the cryptocurrency in the long-term and avoiding selling, it&#39;s hard to imagine the hotel chain will see a huge surge of bitcoin payments following this announcement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My questions is the “HOLD” culture bad for cryptocurrencies? Should we promote the use of crypto more in the community in general?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
