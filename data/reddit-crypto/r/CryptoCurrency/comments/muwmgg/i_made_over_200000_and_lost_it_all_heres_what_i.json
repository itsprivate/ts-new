  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been in the crypto game since 2015. I started with £1500 (Roughly $2000) and in the boom of late 2017 I had managed to accumulate over £155,000/$200,000 mostly from bitcoin. Life changing amount of money right? The things I could have done. The best holiday I could have bought. The nicest sports car I could buy brand new instead of buying a second hand cheap runaround. Shit that amount of money could have paid off my mortgage. Thats past me now though and the hurt is mostly gone, but here&#39;s what I did wrong; </p>\n\n<p>1) When bitcoins dominance started to dwindle I tried splitting the investment into a bunch of different alts that I didnt research nearly enough. I was just eyeballing graphs crudely predicting their movement. Through doing this, my initial £155,000 turned into about £80,000 from the market flopping whereas if I had just kept it sitting in BTC I would have still had a solid £140,000</p>\n\n<p>2) I was looking at the amount in $ and not the amount in BTC. After getting smacked up by alts I decided it would be best to move back into Bitcoin but the market was still in a bit of a crisis. There was massive volatility and so I started trying to day trade my BTC. If I thought another big drop was coming I&#39;d sell. It would climb. I buy back in fomo, same amount in dollars as I had before, but less BTC, then it would fall. </p>\n\n<p>After things had settled I was left with around £4000.</p>\n\n<p>Things to take away from this / TL;DR:</p>\n\n<p>1) Research the fuck out of an alt before diving headfirst. Read whitepapers, think how a project could actual develope and are the devs actively working on their alt with a road map ahead.</p>\n\n<p>2) If you start panicking in dips but plan to hold crypto long term DO NOT try and play the charts and predict buy and sell points to minimise losses if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. Its dangerous and you&#39;ll more than likely end up worse of than if you had left it. Just hold it out and forget about it if you plan to stay. </p>\n\n<p>I have a lot more experience since then on reading charts and purchased an online course specifically for reading candlestick formations. I enjoy futures trading now and im happy with my overall gains this time around. Heres to a long and prosperous bullrun friends.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
