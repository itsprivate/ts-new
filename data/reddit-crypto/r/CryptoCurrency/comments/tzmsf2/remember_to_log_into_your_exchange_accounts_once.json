They have more than less the same thing as the rest of the exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your inquiry.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As stated in Section 12 of our &lt;a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/legal\"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;, if a Kraken account is inactive for an extended period of time, Kraken may have to take certain actions concerning your account depending on your state of residence, including reporting and/or remitting the assets or the value of the assets to the state as required by state unclaimed property law. To avoid this, we encourage you to routinely sign into your account to keep it active.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Virtually all the places I talked to about this said try to log in once a year. A lot of places in the USA won&amp;#39;t force places like exchanges to say your money and stuff isn&amp;#39;t unclaimed until 3 or so years. But it is best to log in at least 1 time a year so you don&amp;#39;t forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note I highly suggest checking out the rules about escheatment for your local area and how to reclaim the property this policy took from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
