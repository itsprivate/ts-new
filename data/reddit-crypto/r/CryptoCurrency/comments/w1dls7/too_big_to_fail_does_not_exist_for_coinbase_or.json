An excerpt From Coinbases own quarterly report that ended March 31, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/nJ4ulrO\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/nJ4ulrO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is NOT a &amp;quot;be careful with Coinbase&amp;quot; post, its a &amp;quot;be careful with ANY centralized exchange&amp;quot; post. I only mention Coinbase because its big but it is not too big to fail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
