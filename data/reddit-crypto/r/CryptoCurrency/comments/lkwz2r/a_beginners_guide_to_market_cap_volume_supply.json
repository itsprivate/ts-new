Most Investors suggest that The Market Cap is a more important factor than the per-share price, as it inform them to easily assess the value and size of any Coin/Token.</p>\n\n<p>The Volume is the total amount of Coins/Tokens that have been traded over a specific timeline, often 24hrs in order to show the daily activity of a particular Crypto Currency. This is an important measurement because it helps us assess whether the market&#39;s recent movement is attributed to increased attention, which can be an incredible tool for predicting future movement.</p>\n\n<p>The Circulating Supply is the approximate amount of a Coins/Tokens that are being actively traded in the market. If the Circulating Supply differs greatly from the Total Supply, it simply means that there is a large amount of that Coin/Token being kept out of the Active Market by Private Investors. When this is the case, the Crypto Currency in question could become subject to a large amount of market manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>The Total Supply is the total amount of Coins/Tokens that are currently in existence, both actively traded and privately stored. If the Total Supply differs greatly from the Circulating Supply, it stands to reason that there is a large amount of that Coin/Token being kept out of the Active Market by Private Investors. When this is the case, the Crypto Currency in question could become subject to a large amount of market manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>The Maximum Supply is the approximate highest amount of Coins/Tokens that will ever exist of the said Crypto Currency in question. The Maximum Supply of a Coin/Token can showcase how much room for growth the Crypto Currency has, but not all Coins/Tokens have a Max Supply Limit. Coins/Tokens that do not have a Max Supply Limit often have different rules for the creation of new Coins/Tokens, and unlimited room to grow.</p>\n\n<p>To easily access and consult these different forms of measurements, I highly recommend using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com\">CoinGecko</a> or <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com\">Coin Market Cap</a>, are websites that compile these measurements for a massive amount of Coins/Tokens for easy-to-use and comprehensive platforms.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
