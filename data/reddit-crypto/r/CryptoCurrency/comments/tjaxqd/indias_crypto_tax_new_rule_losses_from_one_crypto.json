Moreover, as per the full laws, you cannot carry forward losses to another year as well. Now it seems even in the same year, you cannot adjust it with gains from another asset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The government is on a path of de-facto killing crypto by over regulation. If you make the taxes so high and the compliance so expensive, no one will ever invest in crypto - that seems to be the thought process of this utter shit government. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ðŸ–•&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
