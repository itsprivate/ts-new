  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Péter Szilágyi (karalabe.eth)\n@peter_szilagyi\nMar 18  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Complexity is an often overlooked aspect of a system because usually someone else is paying the price for it, not the person creating it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t be mistaken, someone &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; paying the price - whether money, time or mental capacity. They might not be willing/able to do forever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with scalability, complexity also keeps trickling unseen up to the breaking point. At that time, it&amp;#39;s already past the point of no return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Complexity also has the nasty effect of causing cascading failures. Overload people too much, lose capacity, leading to even larger load.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In #Ethereum&amp;#39;s history, complexity never decreased. Every EIP is piling on top. Every major change (1559, merge, sharding, verkle, stateless, L2, etc) is one more nail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m extremely frustrated when a research proposal says &amp;quot;everything&amp;#39;s figured out, it&amp;#39;s just engineering now&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As good as it feels that we&amp;#39;re approaching The Merge, I must emphasize that #Ethereum is not going in a clean direction. Tangentially it&amp;#39;s achieving results, but it&amp;#39;s also piling complexity like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the protocol doesn&amp;#39;t get slimmer, it&amp;#39;s not going to make it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel the root cause is the disconnect between the research and the dev teams. The former has to &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; dream up elegant - standalone - ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The latter needs to juggle every single idea that was ever introduced, whilst surgically expanding the dimensionality of the space.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been engineering attempts to reduce the complexity (module split in Erigon, responsibility split in The Merge). Yet there was never an attempt to reduce the protocol complexity.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system. This is bad.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say what the solution is, but my 2c is to stop adding features and start culling, even at the expense of breaking things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are less and less people knowing and willing to piece together a broken network. And each change pushes more away. /FIN  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LINK to the thread itself: &lt;a href=\"https://nitter.net/peter_szilagyi/status/1504887154761244673#m\"&gt;https://nitter.net/peter_szilagyi/status/1504887154761244673#m&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
