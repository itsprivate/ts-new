Today was a pretty good example. </p>\n\n<p>They ran <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57632831\">this story</a> with the headline: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Binance: Financial watchdog FCA bans crypto-currency exchange</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a pretty startling piece of news to read first thing in the morning, and a bit surprising too. The first line goes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Binance, the world&#39;s biggest crypto-currency exchange, has been banned by the UK&#39;s financial regulator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One could be forgiven for thinking that Binance was now banned in the UK. You have to read &#39;til about halfway through the article to find that all of the stuff that came before it was pure FUD: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This means that people in the UK are not allowed to use Binance&#39;s services to speculate, or bet, on whether the price of a crypto-currency like Bitcoin goes up or down.  </p>\n\n<p>However, <strong><em>they are still allowed to use the website to purchase and sell crypto-currencies</em></strong>, which is not regulated, crypto-currency analyst Colin Stone told the World Business Report programme on BBC World Service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So is Binance banned in the UK? No. Leverage trading is banned - just one of the many services that Binance provides. This is just one in a litany of articles demonstrating a shocking anti-crypto bias from the BBC. </p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, they ran <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-57102038\">a story</a> about how Bitcoin was to blame because a woman sent all her life savings to a man pretending to be [insert name of Doge-loving billionaire douchelord]. An internet scammer told her that if she sent him money, he would send back even more. </p>\n\n<p>When there&#39;s positive news about Bitcoin, they ignore it or distort it to remind the public that crypto is all a scam, and whenever something mildly bad happens, they blow it out of all proportion. </p>\n\n<p>Shame on the BBC for this irresponsible behaviour. I know they are not the only news outlet that does this, but I would have expected better from them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
