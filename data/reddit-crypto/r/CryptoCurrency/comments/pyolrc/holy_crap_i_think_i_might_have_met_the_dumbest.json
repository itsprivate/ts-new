  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ok, so a little backstory. A few months ago, there was this promo going on where if a person would register on an exchange using my link, they would get a cash bonus to their account. </p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t say any more because talking about this topic isn&#39;t allowed on this sub, but since it&#39;s pertinent to this incident. I had to mention it. </p>\n\n<p>So anyways, I told my work friend about it and told him, if he isn&#39;t interested in crypto then he can just take the money and withdraw it to his account. I explained how he will have to do KYC and if he wasn&#39;t comfortable with it, he shouldn&#39;t do it. </p>\n\n<p>He agreed to it, and I guided him through the procedure. Then he told me, he actually wants to invest some of his money in crypto and asked me to make some suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>I obviously gave him a whole speech about how I&#39;m not a financial advisor, cryptocurrencies are volatile, dyor and blah blah blah.</p>\n\n<p>He said &quot;yeah it&#39;s just a few 100 bucks who cares&quot;.\n&quot;Ok, fine&quot; I thought. </p>\n\n<p>He bought Btc, eth, luna, sol and avax. </p>\n\n<p>Now as you all know, Luna sol and avax have had amazing performances in the past few months. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, today he told me he wants to speak to me in private. So we went to park bench on lunch break. </p>\n\n<p>I thought he was going to ask me how he can invest more or something. Instead he goes &quot;I have to tell you I&#39;m not very comfortable being into this whole crypto thing.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ok? </p>\n\n<p>😕😕</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Crypto is against my principles and my values as a person&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Wait. Wtf is  this guy even saying?\n 🤨🤨</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If I made so much money, that means someone else lost. I don&#39;t feel comfortable with that&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I was about to explain how crypto markets aren&#39;t a zero sum game but he then he just continued talking </p>\n\n<p>&quot;And I was reading about how cryptos are really bad for the environment&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I actually stopped him right there and gave a big speech mentioning all the points about how Bitcoin mining is shifting more and more towards renewables, comparing it to the petrodollar system, the energy requirements of gold mining, christmas lights, always-on plugged in requirements, etc. etc. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, this guy obviously had no rebuttal because  guy has  probably only spent like 10 minutes in his entire life researching crypto.</p>\n\n<p>Instead he says &quot;I don&#39;t want to be like those people who only care about money. I don&#39;t want to be that guy who&#39;s materialistic and narcissistic&quot; </p>\n\n<p>🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t even know what to say anymore.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;OK, so what now?&quot; I asked him.</p>\n\n<p>He told me he wants to give me all his crypto and he only wants his original investment. $100 back.</p>\n\n<p>So today, I bought almost 350$ worth of crypto for $100. </p>\n\n<p>And goddamn. I will do my best to avoid speaking to that guy ever again unless I have to for strictly professional reasons. This is the same guy who once said &quot;you believe in science!&quot; as a kind of insult.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m happy to have more crypto in my wallet and just baffled at this level of moral virtue signaling.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
