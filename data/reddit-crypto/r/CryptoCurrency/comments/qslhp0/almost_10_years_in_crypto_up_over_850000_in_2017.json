It&#39;s better to miss the top than to go through the mental strain of a winter market, if you reached your goals or near it.  There are a lot better projects now than there were in 2012-2017.  That being said a lot of projects are still worthless, the coins aren&#39;t but the project is worthless.  </p>\n\n<p>Diversify is ok don&#39;t be afraid to go heavy on a project if market factors, research, use, momentum point to it being a game changer. </p>\n\n<p>In  10 years I&#39;ve only seen 3 projects that made me go wow this is a game changer.  BTC, ETH, and Harmony One.  I saw the potential of Defi, NFTs, gaming, their upcoming milestones,  what they are building could be the what the entire crypto space will use in the next 10 years.  I think I started buying 50,000 20,000 10,000 etc when it was a few cents</p>\n\n<p>I also saw huge potential in the Metaverse and Mana.  This was also one I went heavy into but the game didn&#39;t impress me all that much, Enjin actually has so much potential in this space.  </p>\n\n<p>I know people hate Doge here but early in the year there was a ton of momentum , media , instagram, search es were all pointing to it being a huge mover.   I was buying tens of thoussands of this from .00x to .06</p>\n\n<p>VET I liked the app, The centralized stuff and how it was going to work in the real world confused me I bought nearly a million at a few cents.  I got lucky it&#39;s not what I thought it would be.  I think I was wrong, got in low enough and got lucky.  </p>\n\n<p>That being said I reached my goal this year.  I can see BTC going to 100k in 6 months but I can also see it going to 25k in the next year.  I wanted to extend my goals but I want to take emotion out of it and am almost completely out of it for the rest of the year.  I&#39;ll see you guys in a few years.  I hope all your dreams come true, you do good, and you practice some common sense d a out and profit taking.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
