There have been so many crashes like this one and it will pass and everyone will forget about it. Not only that but Bitcoin will break its ATH again this year, that much is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason you&amp;#39;re down is not because your coin failed, the whole market failed so why sell if you believe in it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re thinking about selling, especially at a loss, I&amp;#39;d advise you to be patient and hold as there&amp;#39;s no point to it and you&amp;#39;ll only lose money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
