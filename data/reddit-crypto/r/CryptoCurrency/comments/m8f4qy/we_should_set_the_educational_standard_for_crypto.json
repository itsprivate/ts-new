I talked to the OP, he is going to continue expanding it.</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUT WAIT, THERE&#39;S MORE</strong>. The post had credits to redditors writing the educational material so.....</p>\n\n<p>I started chatting up some of the guys individually, but that seems to take a little too long. Lets do it another way and <strong>publicly.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I have an idea.</p>\n\n<h1>This is my public letter to us educational material writers:</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I think all of us that have been featured here have a really decent crypto vet knowledge. I believe the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m20cyd/a_complete_list_of_all_the_basic_useful/\">list of knowledge</a> should be pinned on this sub for as long as possible and its OP would not mind updating it as time goes. Having this post pinned will set a standard for, well, obviously the most general crypto subreddit that has a potential now to have one pinned welcome link to get everyone started, but still keep some jokes, stories and news in the normal feed.</p>\n\n<p>So my question to all of us who like to write educational material. Do you want to team up? Imagine what we can achieve together, when writing guides/articles/papers.</p>\n\n<p>Having second opinion is invaluable (As a scientist, I publish papers here and there, having someone else read it, who has experience in the same field [crypto for us] may give it the final touch that increases the quality of the work exponentially.</p>\n\n<p>So would you like to collaborate? We could do discord for instance</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Layneeeee/\">u/Layneeeee</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/CrabCommander/\">u/CrabCommander</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/pippius/\">u/pippius</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/LivingThings37/\">u/LivingThings37</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Weaver96/\">u/Weaver96</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/cryptogrowth/\">u/cryptogrowth</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/BTC2018/\">u/BTC2018</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/GoldenRain99/\">u/GoldenRain99</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/wolfmangpuck/\">u/wolfmangpuck</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/lovinglyhandmade/\">u/lovinglyhandmade</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/TheWierdGuy/\">u/TheWierdGuy</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/calvintheidiot/\">u/calvintheidiot</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/plokij24/\">u/plokij24</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/icysx/\">u/icysx</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/good-as-helix/\">u/good-as-helix</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/DivineEu/\">u/DivineEu</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/nanooverbtc/\">u/nanooverbtc</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Larkinz/\">u/Larkinz</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/birolata/\">u/birolata</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/LargeSnorlax/\">u/LargeSnorlax</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/jackvilles/\">u/jackvilles</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/pseudoHappyHippy/\">u/pseudoHappyHippy</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/chilledmyspine/\">u/chilledmyspine</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/arsonbunny/\">u/arsonbunny</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Nexul1/\">u/Nexul1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/FrontHandNerd/\">u/FrontHandNerd</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/walkinthepark01/\">u/walkinthepark01</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Suuperdad/\">u/Suuperdad</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/bose25/\">u/bose25</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/steavus/\">u/steavus</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Tilted_Till_Tuesday/\">u/Tilted_Till_Tuesday</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Jeremykla/\">u/Jeremykla</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/liau_/\">u/liau_</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Anhowa123/\">u/Anhowa123</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>and u/ YOU?
