When Bitcoin launched, it was most known as a transactional medium for buying and selling on &quot;less than popular&quot; websites. That&#39;s not to say that BTC is only used for illegal activities - but when it was new, one of its most popular uses was on websites like <strong>the silk road</strong> and <strong>the dreaded dark web</strong>....</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today, and the thought that BTC is mainly used for illegal activity is completely laughable. The only people who still believe that BTC is a criminal currency are those who likely don&#39;t know how to use a computer. But it had to start somewhere. </p>\n\n<p>Now, with NFT&#39;s becoming popular, we&#39;re in this weird &quot;in-between&quot; state where digital pictures of memes are literally selling for thousands of dollars. Obviously, anyone with two braincells to rub together know that most NFT art isn&#39;t worth the digital paper it&#39;s put on, yet we&#39;re all staring at our phones and wondering how the fuck this junk is selling, and who&#39;s buying it?</p>\n\n<p>The most obvious answer? <strong>Money laundering.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In an increasingly digital world, what better way is there for criminal organizations to legitimize their money <strong>Completely free of a centralized third party</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>NFT&#39;s are still relatively new, and really shaking up the Crypto world. That being said, once they become more mainstream, you best believe that they&#39;ll be headline news.... And likely not for good reasons. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s my belief that given time, NFT&#39;s could pave the way for further worldwide Crypto restrictions.... Though I&#39;d love to be wrong.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
