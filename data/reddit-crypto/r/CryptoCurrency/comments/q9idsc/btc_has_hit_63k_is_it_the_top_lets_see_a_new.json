My last <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q3f1x0/will_btc_hit_63k_again_is_there_enough_support_to/\">analysis</a> here was about the support around 40K and the rupture of the top on 52.8K, trying to find a projection that lead us to 63K. Here is a graph showing what we saw:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g1svieuszut71.png?width=2557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3897b4470d178c4adf9b0ccfcf5fd1a43a189862\">Strong Support at around 40K with 50&#37; Retracement and Heavy EMA</a></p>\n\n<p>Considering this strong support we did a Fibonacci Projection finding the price target of around 63K, the movement was quite strong and had just breached the last top of around 52.8K.<br/>\nNow doing a new analysis on the graph we should be able to see how the price behaved since our last Analysis:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/95wuxrz60vt71.png?width=2556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23af4a41c0eb6ee4e18b8ebd9dc720cf7dd2161c\">A Projection from 40K give us the Projection at 63K and an Extended Projection at around 77K, the price felt the region of satisfaction at around 58K</a></p>\n\n<p>Using our last point of strong support, at around 40K, we were able to trace an Fibonacci Projection that gives us the Price target of around 63K, which is were we are now! And also the satisfaction zone of around 58K were many players dropped their position to pocket the gains of the bullish movement.</p>\n\n<p>There are huge bullish news coming and it could fuel the movement even further, if we are to consider the 40K as the support for the movement the Extended Projection give us a price target of 77K.<br/>\nWhat do you think, are we already on the <strong>TOP of 63K</strong> or the strong bullish news of BTC ETF will drive us even <strong>higher to 77K</strong>? Did you drop at around 58K? Are you still Bullish or bearish right now?<br/>\nTell me more! Any coin you suggest?<br/>\n<strong><em>It seems I got right most o my past analysis, the projection and top at 50K, Support at 40K, Satisfaction at 58K; do you guys like my analysis method?</em></strong><br/>\nPrepared for a lot of heat on this one!
