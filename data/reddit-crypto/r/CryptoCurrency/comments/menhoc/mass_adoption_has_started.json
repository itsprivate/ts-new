This is the one of the first steps of mass adoption since it actually has a physical product and reduces the imagination of no real money which a lot of people have.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can get these at almost any K-Kiosk or other small grocery stores in Switzerland. As you can read in the top right corner you can load it up with up to CHF 500 (~$530 USD). On the backside of the card is a code that you can enter on their website. There you will receive your Bitcoins in a cryptonow wallet. More on this on <a href=\"https://www.cryptonow.ch/en\">their website</a></p>\n\n<p>I really like the idea to get more people in the world of crypto with this! And by the way, I didn&#39;t have KYC when I bought it but it requires a valid phone number. Hopefully they will come up with more and other cryptocurrencies too! This really made my day :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit: Here are some more information you guys asked for</strong> <em>(imgur is down...)</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qq1zujek9np61.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1999e1332d98d46e815f55807e7b61e35dde8914\">exchange rate of cryptonow - vs on Kraken 53k CHF</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c2ct6qou9np61.png?width=3024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab0e601437877846d9c88659da352c9b29803694\">Backside of the card</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
