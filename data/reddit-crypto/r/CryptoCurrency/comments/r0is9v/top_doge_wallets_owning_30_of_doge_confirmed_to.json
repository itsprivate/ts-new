On 10/29/21 this (cold wallet) woke up and began sending Doge around to difference wallets - most was sent to a new #1 hot wallet with regular ins/outs. Just in time for the soon to be released RH Alpha wallets released</p>\n\n<p>(Additionally the current number 5 wallet is a burn wallet and own 1.41% of Doge.)</p>\n\n<p>If we count the top 17 unknown wallets, they own roughly 18.75% of the Doge in existence (which again likely includes other exchanges). A far cry from the 43.7% that gets thrown around if you count the known RH wallets/burn wallet.</p>\n\n<p>——————-</p>\n\n<p>I’ve wrote on Reddit a few times about this wallet but this is the first time a RH Alpha transaction can be traced back to that old wallet and provide further evidence its RH holding roughly 30% of Doge in existence on behalf of their users. (Rh had previously stated they didn’t own a sizable amount of any coin on their platform. Which could be true and just be semantics - they could still hold a sizable amount on behalf of their clients.)</p>\n\n<p>Previous posts about this situation but didn’t have this additional proof.</p>\n\n<p>Number 3 on this post <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qtacz9/a_few_reasons_why_doge_is_misunderstood_and_has/\">A few reasons why Doge is misunderstood and has better Tokenomics than you thought.</a></p>\n\n<p>a comment on <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/qj7rrx/comment/hioa97q/\">this thread summarized everything that was known up to that point with further links</a> but will be slightly out of date.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing this lacks is a confirmation from RH but exchanges are notorious at not identifying their wallets.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r0fgjb/1_4_8_15_16_17_top_doge_wallets_owning_30_of_doge/hls4fwe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3\">Last note a previous version of this post was removed by auto mod because of too many topics</a> when another Doge post temporarily hit top 50 and later dropped off. So I had to create a new post.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
