I would stay away from all NFTs and especially the &amp;quot;established&amp;quot; and expensive ones. The prices are inflated by a couple of wealthy crypto-bros who are not wealthy enough to manipulate mid-cap coins anymore. They realized that it is incredibly easy to make idiotic Jpegs, sell them to themselves and the community will do the legwork and write articles about &amp;quot;Bored Ugly Gorilla Club for 6.000.000!!&amp;quot; and so on. This will lead to suckers buying this shit for &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; (bro, it&amp;#39;s only 10 ETH, bro!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a place for a virtual market? Undoubtedly yes, but you will not sell you ugly-ass cartoon for millions in a couple years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
