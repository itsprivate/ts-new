This money is enough for someone to retire and live a happy life and falling for such a petty scam is stupidity at its finest. Now there is one very happy Nigerian prince out there. Doing almost nothing for a cool 3.6 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have decided to do research on tools that can be used to not fall for these scams. I will make a post on what these scams look like, what you can do to make other people aware and not fall for these yourself. It may not be perfect but I will try. I can use all the help I can get. There is no one out there who will double your money willingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:- Thanks for the awards. I have made a promise and intend to keep it. If you guys have any suggestions please do DM me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2:- Many of you don&amp;#39;t know how these scams work, &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s1a7ft/can_someone_explain_to_me_how_people_fall_for/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3\"&gt;so here is my old post attempting to explain it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
