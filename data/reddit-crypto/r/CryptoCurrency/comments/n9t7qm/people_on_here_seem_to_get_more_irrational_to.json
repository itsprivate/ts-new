He is convinced, the USD will lose 99.9999% of value within a decade, that &quot;it&#39;ll take about a month to go from 3$ gallons of milk to 300k$ gallons of milk&quot;, that &quot;EVERY SINGLE RESERVE CURRENCY EVER&quot; suddenly collapsed and that &quot;It happened already. I&#39;m telling you the game is over, already, and you&#39;re in denial.&quot; He has 11k karma 30k moons and recently received gold.</p>\n\n<p>Today I saw <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9s76i/this_is_for_all_my_homies_who_spent_every_dollar/\">this thread</a> with very rational trading advice: &quot;Every day right now, every waking second right now- you should be focused on buying crypto. Your entire life should be consumed of making money (fiat) to deposit into your bank account, so you can buy more crypto&quot;. Looking at his account, I learned that COVID is not real, the moon landing was not real, and that vaccines cause autism. He has 32k karma and 4.2k moons.</p>\n\n<p>If you are asking for advice here, especially if you&#39;re a newbie, please don&#39;t expect everyone to be an expert (or to be rational human beings), also not people who have been here for a while and have a lot of karma (seems obvious, but I think many people use karma as a proxy for how good a post probably is subconsciously). These are extreme examples, but many people who seem a bit more rational on here also can&#39;t wrap their hand around concepts like uncertainty and that stuff isn&#39;t guaranteed to go up. Please be suspicious of everyone, and it&#39;s a cliché by now, but: do your own research. Be safe!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: also see the comments by <a href=\"/u/stonkgobrrrr\">u/stonkgobrrrr</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9t7qm/people_on_here_seem_to_get_more_irrational_to/gxqoyg3?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3\">right in this thread</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
