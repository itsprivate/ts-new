Cool. Nobody is gonna judge you. We all need to eat from time to time.\nBut you missed the golden rule of investment and I&amp;#39;m not gonna say it here ... Every comment is about the veterans  telling the newbies what they should have done... but greed is a human flaw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;King Solomon supposedly said it first:\nThis too shall pass.\nI told myself the same when we reached 50k last year and started saving for the rainy days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need bad times to appreciate the good times.\nThe only question is ... Is your bag full of solid tokens that can stand the test of time like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal opinion: I&amp;#39;m not buying anything untill we are under 20k.
