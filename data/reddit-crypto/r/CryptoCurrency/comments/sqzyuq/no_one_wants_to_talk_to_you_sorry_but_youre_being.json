If a random stranger just send you a private message saying &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;, theres already a 99.9999% chance its a scammer. I&amp;#39;m sorry but no one wants to talk to you, you&amp;#39;re not special, you&amp;#39;re not the lucky winner who is going to test a new project. You&amp;#39;re being scammed. You would think everyone knows that but if they are doing it, its because it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, no exchange or bank is ever going to ask you for your password. So please, be smart and never trust anyone, if you have the slightest doubt about the legitimacy of something, call your exchange, call your bank, make a post, but dont take any risk!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
