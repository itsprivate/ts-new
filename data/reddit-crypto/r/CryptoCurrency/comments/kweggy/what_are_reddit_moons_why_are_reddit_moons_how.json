  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>If you think our Moons are just incentivizing spam and turning our front page into a dumpster fire you are probably right... For now...</p>\n\n<h1><strong>What are Reddit Moons?</strong></h1>\n\n<p>Even though our Moons don&#39;t look and feel like a real currency there is a lot more to them than meets the eye. By definition, Reddit Moons are designed as community points that represent your contribution to a certain community. They are currently residing on the Rinkeby test net waiting for the Reddit bakeoff winner to be announced because Reddit doesn&#39;t want to pay a few dollars for every Moon transaction we make from the Vault.</p>\n\n<p>Since there aren&#39;t many similar projects out there you can compare them to the reward models used on Steemit and Hive. Content creators are rewarded for quality content while curators can also get a share of the reward by providing even more value with their comments and discussions. In theory, community points should ensure that we stop upvoting bullshit and turn our focus toward quality content but that is a very far-fetched goal at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>If we want decentralized governance the tokens need to be distributed fairly among all contributors so a distribution model was created:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Initially, 50 million Points will be distributed based on karma earned in the subreddit to date. Then, over the first year, another 50 million Community Points will be distributed. Over time, the amount distributed every cycle will continue to decrease so that the total number of Points will approach a maximum cap of 250 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The theory behind it is that early contributors can accumulate their Moons by participating in content creation and curation on a regular basis. Since the rewards will drop over time, the price of Moons should rise but for that to happen a lot of stars have to align.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Why are Reddit Moons?</strong></h1>\n\n<p>Somewhere in 2016/2017 data became <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data\">more valuable than Oil</a> and people started realizing that they are doing a lot of free work online. You come to this sub for news and entertainment but that sub wouldn&#39;t need to exist without you. On top of that, you are served ads from Reddit so they can keep paying for hosting services while also making a few bucks on the side.</p>\n\n<p>Social media users got it a lot worse though. Since they share their real identity and personal information, Cambridge Analytica managed to collect over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica#:%7E:text=2016%20presidential%20election,-Further%20information%3A%20Timeline&amp;text=CA&#x27;s%20involvement%20in%20the%202016,on%20over%20220%20million%20Americans.\">5000 data points</a> on 220 Million American voters prior to the 2016 election. In other words, they could make people vote for Hamsters if they wanted to.</p>\n\n<p>This leads us to the conclusion that your attention has become a product that can be tokenized thanks to blockchain, and Moons are the first iteration of that. Your attention is the product Reddit sells to advertisers and the Moons you get in return are your dividends. You can&#39;t expect such a model to run smoothly since day one but it seems like we will get there sooner or later. If community points become a standard on Reddit other big names will have to follow with their own reward systems. A domino effect that would lead to our aunts getting paid by Facebook for playing Candy Crush with passion and commitment for all those years.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>How are Reddit Moons?</strong></h1>\n\n<p>Not that bad actually. As far as use cases go, you can convert your Moons to fiat for starters. Not many testnet tokens can do that actually. Thanks to Honeyswap and xDai you can provide liquidity with your Moons and earn interest over time. Centralized exchanges have <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/what-is-reddit-moon\">shown interest for Moons</a> very early and even though they didn&#39;t say they will list them we all know they will, because why not? If you aren&#39;t that tech-savvy and don&#39;t want to go through the trouble of connecting to the xDai network you will probably want to create an account with a CEX  and sell your tokens. Those that list them first get thousands of signups instantly. A lot easier than doing a marketing campaign.</p>\n\n<p>Look at Moon&#39;s as tokenized attention. Those that see value in your attention will compete for it and the more they compete, the more valuable Moons become. The only ugly part is that we as a community need to create value for them first. You should also expect Reddit to help with that so all in all, there is a bright future for your Moons. Treat them with care.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Reddit Moons are still on the testnet but they can be converted into USD.</p></li>\n<li><p>Your attention can now be tokenized, traded, and sold to the highest bidder thanks to Reddit Moons.</p></li>\n<li><p>In the long run, Moons aim to encourage quality content and reward those that provide it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Edit: TLDR added</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
