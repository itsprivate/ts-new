The subscription also includes a preinstalled tech stack, which will also include the Algorand Wallet. In addition, a neobank is being worked on. The neobank, which builds on Algorand, will offer a whole suite of financial products from insurance to loans. In addition, people will of course have access to the various Algorand projects such as supply chain management for farmers and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The company is also working on licensing deals with other manufacturers such as Apple so that more smartphones can be offered. After one year, the smartphones will be upgraded automatically. The whole thing is to start soon in Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1rmGPgRBBoQKN/\"&gt;https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1rmGPgRBBoQKN/&lt;/a&gt; (Timestamp: 1:29:01)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
