Sadly the economy is still in the craps and the stock market is not even close to rebounding. This is not the bottom. If you have money to buy crypto, probably best to wait. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think crypto will go up a reasonable amount while the stock market is losing value. We could very well be on our way to $10k here in the next month or two. Ethereum at $500 is a very reasonable price target abs Bitcoin at $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t invest in alt coins. You’ll be able to get them at pennies on the dollar. This summer will not be kind to crypto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I’m wrong and this post will make crypto change course but I doubt it. This is the time when real money is made. Time to average down and lower your cost basis greatly. Be safe out there people!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
