Anybody who has bought a house knows how much money is spent on paperwork that adds no real benefit to either seller or buyer. Anybody who has tried to dream up a way to create a digital second hand media market without tokenisation knows how complicated it gets. </p>\n\n<p>The framework for this is already in place. GET Protocol is already a reality for ticketing. Brave is tokenising <strong><em>attention</em></strong>. Whilst that is still in a very immature and centralised form, BAT will not be the last project to attempt to tokenise attention, and Brave&#39;s model is working. Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and such, are effectively tokenised units of computation, no negotiating with salespeople required.</p>\n\n<p>The sheer amount of wasted economic effort that will be saved by the tokenisation revolution is frankly staggering. Everyone be they an investor, a techie, or just your average joe, is going to be using cryptocurrency, whether they realise it or not.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
