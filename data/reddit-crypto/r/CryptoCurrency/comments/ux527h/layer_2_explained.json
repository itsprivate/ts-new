The highway is incredibly congested and has an extremely hefty toll, which goes up the more congested it gets. However people are willing to pay to use it because, in a dystopian world full of bad agents, it&amp;#39;s the safest highway around; in fact if anyone attempts a carjacking or is about to cause an accident, their vehicle will instantly be vapourised by thousands of laser turrets (nodes) which keep watch over the highway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Layer 2 protocols that use rollups, like Arbitum and Optimism, are bus services that run on the highway, they bundle up passengers (transactions) into a single vehicle (contract) and split the cost of the toll amongst everyone riding on the bus. The bus inherits the security of the highway but at a fraction of the cost to each passenger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Layer 2 protocols that use side chains, like Polygon, are a rail network that services the same route as the highway, people can use the train to get to the same destination, but they don&amp;#39;t inherit the same security as the highway. There are stations that enable passengers to go between the rail network and the highway but when passengers are travelling they aren&amp;#39;t protected by the highway security. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to my TED talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
