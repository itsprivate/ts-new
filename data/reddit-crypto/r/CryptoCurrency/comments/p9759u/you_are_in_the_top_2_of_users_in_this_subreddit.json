The Numbers</h1>\n\n<p>Considering the number of vaults opened was 70k a couple months ago, data suggests we would have around 80k vaults today. Currently as of August 22, 2021 there are exactly 3,352,923 members in <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a>. A quick calculation shows us that 70,000/3,352,923 = 0.02385. Thus, only about 2% of users in this subreddit actually have their vaults open.</p>\n\n<h1>2. What Is A Vault?</h1>\n\n<p>Vaults are Reddit&#39;s very own built in wallets used to store community points such as our beloved moons! Users who have their vaults opened are eligible to receive moons from distributions and can receive/send moon tips to other users.</p>\n\n<h1>3. How Do I Open My Vault?</h1>\n\n<p>For the un-vaulted, open the Reddit app on either iOS or Android and click your profile picture in the top-left corner of the app. From there you will see a &quot;Vault&quot; option in the drop-down menu, click that and create your vault. <strong>MAKE SURE YOU WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED PHRASE AT THIS POINT.</strong> I&#39;ve seen so many stories of Redditor&#39;s losing access to their account and unfortunately never being able to recover their moons. Don&#39;t become another number in the amount of users who lost their precious moons.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
