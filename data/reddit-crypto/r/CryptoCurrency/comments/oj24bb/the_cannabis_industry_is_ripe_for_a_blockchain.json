A Hash Coin, if you will.</p>\n\n<p>As a worker in the cannabis industry I wanted to shed some light on why this is a <em>great</em> idea and how useful a blockchain could really be.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, on the grow end, every single plant is tracked and catalogued from the day it reaches 6 inches in size. Phallic puns aside, getting every single plant tagged and accounted for is a massive use of man hours when working in a facility such as I do with over 3000 plants. </p>\n\n<p>Since every single plant must be accounted for, we also have to make an entry in the system upon creating, destroying and <em>moving</em> these plants. So, when its time to transplant everything from our Veg room into our Flower room, we have a man who&#39;s <em>entire fucking job</em> revolves around moving those plants <em>in the digital system one at a time.</em></p>\n\n<p>If that seems excessive, its because it is.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m just an over paid gardener ape, but even I know that our workload would be significantly reduced by the introduction of a blockchain to store and organize that data.</p>\n\n<p>But we still have to talk about dispensaries.</p>\n\n<p>This one is a no brainer: Use the Hash Coins for payment on the very blockchain used to keep inventory in dispensaries. </p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you. The inventory systems at dispensaries are <em>fucked.</em></p>\n\n<p>Those of you who work in retail know how hard it is to keep on top of inventory, especially during peak business. Cannabis business never stops. It&#39;s a constant barrage of moving parts that are getting constantly jammed and hung up on one another. I would have to come in at 6 AM and do inventory for 2 hours <em>every day</em> while working at a dispensary.</p>\n\n<p>Fucking nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, those are my thoughts about how a cannabis blockchain would be really cool and beneficial. I&#39;m just an ape gardener, so I appreciate any feedback from all you wonderful people who understand more about the implementation of crypto.</p>\n\n<p>I just think it would be cool to buy a joint, scan a qr code, and know exactly where my weed came from.</p>\n\n<p>Also you know, fuck the banks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
