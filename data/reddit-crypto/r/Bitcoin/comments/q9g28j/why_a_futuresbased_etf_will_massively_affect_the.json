  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The  SEC has now finally approved a Bitcoin Futures ETF. However it seems  like the sentiment about this in terms of price movement for Bitcoin is  not where it should be. People think that purchases of a futures ETF  will have almost no affect on the spot price of BTC, which is absolutely  untrue.<br/>\nLet me elaborate, as this might blow your mind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>When  a futures ETF launches, there will be way more buying than selling  pressure. We can see this already, because futures on exchanges trade  for a much higher price than BTC spot. On FTX, the BTC-0325 Future is  trading at 65&#39;600$ while BTC is trading at 61&#39;080$.</p>\n\n<p>When  futures ETFs launch, they too will reflect higher prices than the  Bitcoin spot price. What will risk-averse, smart investors do? They will  short the high ETF price, BUY BTC spot on a lower price and pocket the  difference. Currently doing this on an exchange would yield a 7.5%  risk-less return within the next 6 months.</p>\n\n<p><em>ELI5?:  I will now spot-buy Bitcoin for 61k and sell it to you for 65k BTC on  March 25th. I can arrange and fix this sales price by shorting the ETF  now. I have made 4k of secure profits.</em></p>\n\n<p>As  you can see in this example, the availability of a futures ETF directly  affected the spot demand of BTC. With more and more ETFs launching and  trillions of dollars being directed towards them, price spreads will  increase and so will the buying pressure on spot markets. This is huge  and many have yet to understand this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>General Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>The  approval of a Bitcoin Futures ETF on Wall Street will legitimize the  asset once and for all in the US. It brings the credibility of crypto to  a new level for many higher-ups in finance.</p>\n\n<p>Also,  regulation is still one of the biggest risks we&#39;re facing. The further  crypto can spread, the harder it will be to regulate crypto in a way  that is harmful to the financial industry. And an ETF is doing exactly  this, no matter whether it is futures-based or not. You cannot take down  something that is so deeply connected to the economy. Once people  allocate their 401k, IRAs etc. regulators will be even more weary of  hurting the crypto space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>The  launch of a US futures based BTC ETF is huge, both from a technical and  general perspective. It is untrue that it won&#39;t directly affect spot  prices and this will soon become clear to us all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
