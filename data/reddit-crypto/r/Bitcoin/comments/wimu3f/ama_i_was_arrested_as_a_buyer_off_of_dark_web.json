Me and co-defendants sold marijuana bought off of Alphabay (dark web marketplace). It’s rare for LE to go after buyers rather than vendors. I was the leader so to speak that orchestrated the whole thing. We live in the US in states with extremely strict laws regarding marijuana (South). We operated around 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to lack of evidence, I got probation for 5 years but got off the first week. (No that’s not a typo) One co-defendant got 5 years prison but only served 2 years because of good behavior. No other arrests was made with crew I was over: We were not in the same state. The states neighbored each other and wasn’t a far drive from each other. We both refused to cooperate with investigation so they “threw the book at us”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d be happy to answer any questions. I can provide proof to mods in private. This all got me into bitcoin is why I chose to post this here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL; DR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sold marijuana bought off darkweb &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arrested for drug conspiracy &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Co-defendant got prison. I got probation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
