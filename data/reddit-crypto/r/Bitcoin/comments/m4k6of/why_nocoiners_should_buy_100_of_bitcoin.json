Surely I was pissing the $100 away because an imaginary internet coin couldn&#39;t possibly be worth that much.</p>\n\n<p>I watched Bitcoin rocket to $20k, crater to $3k, and bounce back. Then, in early 2020 my outlook changed drastically. To my surprise, it was doggedly holding onto a $10k valuation. To rise and fall and years later be back up so high...that is not how a bubble on a weak asset plays out.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s when I made a much larger purchase, giving Bitcoin a real place among my assets. I&#39;ve accumulated more value on that purchase than any other investment of mine in the same time span.</p>\n\n<p>But without that $100 purchase in 2017, I wouldn&#39;t have gained the education. And without the education, I never would have had the conviction to buy a more meaningful amount in early 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The point of all this is that micro-sized investments are much more meaningful than you might think. What&#39;s $100 if it enables you to acquire knowledge or experience that makes you much more money down the line?</p>\n\n<p>So, if you are too unsure about putting thousands of dollars into Bitcoin, try $100...or maybe $50...or $10. Whatever you are comfortable with.</p>\n\n<p>Life is too short to stay on the sidelines.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
