They acted like it&#39;s no big deal. They had absolutely no interest in investing more (even though they easily can, they aren&#39;t homeless, etc...)  Even when I mentioned they can have bitcoin in their RRSP (kinda like a 401k in US) their eyes got a little bigger, then back to same size.</p>\n\n<p>So these people saw with their own eyes and money and are still not interested.</p>\n\n<p>One person came into an inheritance of about $100k, he said he invested all in stocks (advice from financial advisor) and DOES NOT WANT ANY MORE IN BITCOIN. (his original investment was maybe $1000)he was almost aggressive with me, he did not want to invest another penny in bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>THAT BLEW MY FUCKIN MIND!!!</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m drinking tonight.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
