Really what I was trying to point out is that a lot of the development on hardware/software/and mobile application doesn&#39;t incorperate user friendly design for those individuals with such disabilities, bitcoin as a protocol I realize has nothing to do with this. I just think it&#39;s a thought that a lot of us with vision neglect to consider. Thank you all for the participation in the discussion. I simply feel it&#39;s important to discuss and incorporate as many as possible if the narrative behind bitcoin specifically is &#39;to be your own bank&#39;.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
