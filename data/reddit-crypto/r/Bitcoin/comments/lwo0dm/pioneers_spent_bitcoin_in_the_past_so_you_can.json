Be thankful that they made bitcoin into a legit usable currency it is today. If everyone back then held, bitcoin would be worthless today. Im guessing most of the people here heard about bitcoin in last 3 years and jumped recently into it. I never held bitcoin but I remeber spending 30k 50k 100k worth of todays bitcoin on darknetmarkets and dont regret it a single bit. Stop being obnoxious its not funny anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for my english</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
