The founders created it and walked away. It&amp;#39;s like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick away. There&amp;#39;s no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it&amp;#39;s supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn&amp;#39;t need self promotion to thrive, it doesn&amp;#39;t fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there&amp;#39;s Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn&amp;#39;t need them to survive and won&amp;#39;t need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it&amp;#39;s supposed to and it&amp;#39;ll continue to do what it&amp;#39;s supposed to. It&amp;#39;s the money of the future of our science fiction novels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no Krypto Kris to market shitty debit cards. There&amp;#39;s no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There&amp;#39;s no J Powell to magically expand the money supply with a cobol fueled wand to create a 9 trillion USD balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle that will silently tick away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
