Growing up I never forgot how they gave us the Euro when I was a kid in the early 2000s. Initially for every &amp;#39;deutsche mark&amp;#39; we got 0.5 Euros, but I was super confused when my parents told me that their salary got divided by 2 (x0.5), but consumer prices went back to the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; deutsche mark prices within one year - meaning as an end result they didn&amp;#39;t get divided, but salaries stagnated. I was ~8 years old at the time, didn&amp;#39;t understand what was going on, but felt that something super strange happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2008 the financial crisis/euro crisis hit, people where afraid, the media went crazy and when I was ~14 years old I needed to learn that I can&amp;#39;t get interest at the bank when I want to save my money for hard times in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finished school, went to university, studied medicine, did my PhD and looked at the world: House prices doubled!\nI realized that even as a physician in Germany I will not be able to buy a house in my home town without being indebted until the rest of my life, will not have the financial freedom to pursue projects which might take time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got depressed, I questioned everything, why do I even get up in the morning? My whole life I tried to do everything right, I saved for my future family, I studied, did research, but there was no chance of getting out of the debt-machinery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned about austrian economics, time preference and how fiat is affecting every single aspect of our lives, including morals, and the general perspective we look at our life&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pray to God that Bitcoin will continue to transform the life&amp;#39;s of people on the globe, like it did mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was lost, but now I&amp;#39;m found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everybody building and supporting the Bitcoin network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
