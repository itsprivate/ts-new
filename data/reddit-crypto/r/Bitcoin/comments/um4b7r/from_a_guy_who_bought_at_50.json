I bought at $50 in 2011 on a long gone exchange, and immediately Bitcoin fell to $12. I felt stupid. So in defiance, I promised myself I wouldn&amp;#39;t sell until it reached an impossibly high number.  1000x. But $50k came and I couldn&amp;#39;t bear to sell. I love this journey too much. And I see now that my crazy goal was way too low. My vision for Bitcoin was too small. \nNow I need a 10000x return. When that day comes, I want this post here so I can rub it in the faces of the zero-coiners who were here in 2022 and who, even when offered Bitcoin at a huge discount, refused to buy in. You&amp;#39;ll never buy. You don&amp;#39;t have the vision or stamina to not only acquire Bitcoin, but to keep your Bitcoin.\nGo the fuck away. You make &lt;a href=\"/r/bitcoin\"&gt;/r/bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; suck.\nBut please come back the day Bitcoin kisses $500k. I&amp;#39;ll have a message for you on that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
