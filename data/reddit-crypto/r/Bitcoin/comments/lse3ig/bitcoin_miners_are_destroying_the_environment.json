It doesn&#39;t get much more Bitcoiner than that, MintGreen.</p>\n\n<p>Another cool application is a pilot project from <strong>Genesis Mining</strong> in Sweden, where they&#39;re directing waste heat into a greenhouse used to grow fruits and vegetables and improve local self-sufficiency. Many of Genesis&#39; locations around the world are powered by renewables.</p>\n\n<p>But the article simply wouldn&#39;t be complete without <strong>the legendary #SPA256,</strong> which is still to this day the coolest method we&#39;ve ever seen to stack sats: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessePeltan/status/1287518077291241473\">https://twitter.com/JessePeltan/status/1287518077291241473</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
