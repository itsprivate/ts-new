I can&#39;t contribute to society much anymore so I&#39;m supposed to always be on the bottom rung.</p>\n\n<p>And that mindset is what made me sell years ago and I worry I&#39;ll psych myself out and do it again.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else feel it&#39;s too good to be true?</p>\n\n<p>And because I&#39;ve been DCAing here and there its not anything I haven&#39;t already mentally written off or will completely collapse if BTC does.</p>\n\n<p>Just doesn&#39;t feel like something people like me can accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you for coming to my therapy session 😆 these last couple of months have been a ride.</p>\n\n<p>2nd edit: I&#39;m a mom not a dad haha.
