That means you can technically buy 0.00000001 bitcoin if you wanted to. <strong>The value of one satoshi at the time of posting is $0.00048878</strong>. Still sounds cheap to me.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as a closing remark, a reminder to please not buy bitcoin on Robinhood, Paypal, or eToro. They do not allow you to keep your bitcoin, by moving it off their platform. Buy from an exchange where fees are lowest, and then move it to a non-custodial wallet, where you get a seed phrase and private key. </p>\n\n<p>My personal favourite is Exodus. </p>\n\n<p>Happy investing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
