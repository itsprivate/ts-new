The economy would collapse so severely that, even with your relative wealth increasing, the quality of your life would decrease. </p>\n\n<p>The truth is that 1 million dollar btc is not incompatible with a strong centralized economy. Bitcoin has plenty of utility even if the worlds of fiat, stocks, and bonds proceed apace. It can still have massive growth potential without you wishing destruction upon the world as we know it.</p>\n\n<p>I understand being skeptical of the goodwill of institutions. I understand being fearful of hyperinflation. But to chuckle with glee and hope for the world to burn is not a productive attitude. Simply be glad to be involved with a promising new asset class, and accept, WITH HUMILITY, that if bitcoin maximalists are right, it could create a tremendous amount of suffering.</p>\n\n<p>Get rich, fine.
