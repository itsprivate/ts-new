  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I buy Bitcoin every month with the max amount I can from my salary. Its basically the FIRE way of investing but instead of S&amp;amp;P I buy Bitcoin. Started to buy in October 2017 and have bought every month ever since. I did not have any meaningful savings so the only way to get Bitcoin was to work for fiat and buy every month. I buy when its up, I buy when its down. Few years went by and I was basically at no profit (during corona dip) but it didn&amp;#39;t matter. I had a long term goal. Now it looks easy and great in hindsight. But I can tell you, it wasn&amp;#39;t easy and you&amp;#39;re not late. You can do the same I am doing. All you need to do is start. And keep at it. Theres no get rich quick. But there&amp;#39;s get rich slowly. And that&amp;#39;s called Bitcoin. I document my journey in this blog. Hopefully you find it inspiring and it motivates you to stack more sats! Happy birthday Bitcoin!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-18-january-2021/\"&gt;https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-18-january-2021/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
