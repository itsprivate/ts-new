The Ruble is in a historic collapse, and their MOEX stocks can&amp;#39;t sustain a drop further; it&amp;#39;s down 60% in 90-days, all while Brent tops $100, which is crazy considering most of the exchange is made of gas giants. Gold is acting counterintuitively as well, retreating from a feel-good faux spike. Russia&amp;#39;s largest bank limited withdrawals to $20 yesterday. Apple Pay doesn&amp;#39;t work after Apple removed banking support in Russia. Reports on the ground that most debit cards have been suspended. Reports credit cards have had their limits slashed 50% or more. And it&amp;#39;s only been 24 hours...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happens in the next 72-hours will in my opinion lay the groundwork for bitcoin&amp;#39;s next violent uptrend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
