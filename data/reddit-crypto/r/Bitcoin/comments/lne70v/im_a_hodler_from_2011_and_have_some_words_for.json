Do you know the emotional toll it puts on a person to hold through three bear markets!? DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE COST???????</p>\n\n<p>For new bitcoiners &amp; pre-coiners:</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t feel bad for not understanding bitcoin immediately, it takes a long time. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re not late. Everyone including myself felt late. It is still e-a-r-l-y.</p>\n\n<p>HINDSIGHT IS 20/20. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. Seize the day and it&#39;s time to go all in. This asset is now de-risked and a 10000000 times better buy now than back in 2011 from a risk adjusted perspective.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve watched this god damn internet project grow from literally being mocked 24/7 including by holders and now it&#39;s being adopted as a treasury reserve asset by Publicly listed companies. It has already won. The risk is gone.</p>\n\n<p>Buy bitcoin now and front-run every public and privately listed corporation, and every nation states that wants to stay relevant in the 21st century too.</p>\n\n<p>The educational material is awesome nowadays. I have been studying bitcoin 5+ hours a day for the past 2.5 years and every week I learn something new about bitcoin and how money works and realise how ignorant I was before.</p>\n\n<p>First buy Bitcoin. Second invest in yourself through education. Investing in educating yourself will quell any anxiety around holding such a large % of capital in Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>HODL does not stand for &quot;hold on for dear life&quot;. That&#39;s dumb.</p>\n\n<p>HODL is from a drunk misspelling from a post on the bitcoin talk forum about the price crashing and a dude&#39;s girlfriend out a lesbian bar.</p>\n\n<p>Open to answering questions.</p>\n\n<p>Peace.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
