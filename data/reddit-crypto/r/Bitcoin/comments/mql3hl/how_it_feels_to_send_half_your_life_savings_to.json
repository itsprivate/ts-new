Copy the deposit address from BlockFi noting, as ever, the ominous warning just below my deposit address QR-code along the lines of (paraphrasing) &quot;Hey dumbass, if you send coins to the wrong address, they&#39;re gone forever, got it?&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Yes I&#39;ve got it, not my first rodeo, but thank you BlockFi. I copy the address to my clipboard, paste it into the &quot;send&quot; field. I browse current transaction fees and settle on a speed I&#39;m satisfied with. I hit send. I see a warning prompt telling me that the transaction fees are an unusually high percentage of the amount I&#39;m sending. What&#39;s that? Oh, silly me, I entered the amount in mBTC (Electrum denominates balances and transactions in 1/1000ths of BTC, FYI). No sweat. I delete the transaction and start again. Right amount this time, copy, paste, quick eyeball scan from Chrome to Electrum to make sure everything matches. Send. </p>\n\n<p>Then I see something in the Electrum &quot;Outputs&quot; popup that makes my stomach drop through the floor. The address I see in front of me is totally different than my BlockFi deposit address. It&#39;s an address I&#39;ve never seen before. </p>\n\n<p>My body floods with adrenaline in an instant. I&#39;m overcome with a dawning sense of horror. Did I just shred the countless sats I&#39;ve worked so long and so hard to stack in an instant? Did I just light half my future on fire with a single click? I feel like vomiting. My hands are shaking. It&#39;s BTC. There&#39;s nothing to be done... no one to call. Someone somewhere just got the gift of a lifetime... or astronomically more probably its just gone. My mind grapples for an explanation...</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s when my sickened sense of dread plunges even deeper, as I recall: I had been poking around the blockchain earlier today, looking at some activity of interesting addresses (I like to play with some on-chain data for analysis etc.). I realize I had been copying and pasting a bunch of foreign addresses in Chrome just a few hours earlier. What if I one of those addresses was still on my Mac clipboard and I pasted one of them into Electrum? As if some Whale with 20k+ coins needs mine too... </p>\n\n<p>All of this is flying through my head at the speed of light, while my body is still being ravaged by coursing adrenaline and I&#39;m imagining what my incredibly sweet but also incredibly crypto-skeptical father would say after haranguing me for years about how crazy it is to be your own custodian and how it will all end in tears... he&#39;s right. I think about how arrogant and self-satisfied I&#39;ve sounded for the last x-years, telling everyone about how BTC is the future and patting myself on the back for my brilliant, brilliant insight and TeCHnoLoGIcaL GeNIus. I&#39;m almost 31 and I just learned a child&#39;s lesson.... at a staggering, life-altering cost...</p>\n\n<p>All of this transpires in the space of a few ragged breaths. As I gather myself, I start clicking through the Electrum interface in a mad frenzy, trying to make sense of what&#39;s happened. That&#39;s when I realize... My Electrum window is unusually small (I was looking at it side by size with my Chrome window) and it&#39;s placed near the edge of my Macbook screen so it&#39;s a bit clipped and the content is wrapping. I&#39;m looking at the CHANGE address, and as I shift and resize the window I see that a small amount of BTC has moved to one of MY addresses WAY down my address list (the change), and that the main transaction has gone to the address I intended. A short while later I get an email ping from BlockFi telling me I have a pending deposit. I exhale, and get up to go change my underwear.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
