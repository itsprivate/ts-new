How would it do this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bank Secrecy Act §5318A allows the Secretary to identify a &amp;quot;primary money laundering concern&amp;quot; and take &amp;quot;special measures&amp;quot; to (1) require financial institutions to report information on the concern, and/or (2) prohibit FIs from maintaining accounts related to the concern. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Special measures&amp;quot; authority is vast power that the Secretary of the Treasury has today, so in the current statute there are checks on that power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, the law requires that Treasury engage in a public rulemaking before instituting a prohibition. Second, the secretary can impose a surveillance special measure through a simple order, but its duration is limited to 120 days and must be accompanied by a public rulemaking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While not full due process, these limitations at least alert the public and gives the public some opportunity to comment on a special measure&amp;#39;s merit or constitutionality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new provision would do three things:  -Add &amp;quot;certain transmittal of funds&amp;quot; to the list of things that can be banned by the Secretary  -Eliminate all public notice and comment requirements  -Eliminate the 120-day limitation for measures imposed without regulation &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xhvownvlr2e81.jpg?width=583&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a2e0bc4cc2f6777391e35e447099fc21d8a8c1b7\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xhvownvlr2e81.jpg?width=583&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a2e0bc4cc2f6777391e35e447099fc21d8a8c1b7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If adopted into law, this provision would be disaster not just for crypto but for privacy and democratic public process related to *all* types of financial transactions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It empowers the Secretary to prohibit any (or indeed all) cryptocurrency transactions (or any other kind of transaction) without any process, rulemaking, or limitation on the duration of the prohibition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This provision was first introduced as an amendment to the national Defense Authorization Act last year  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n8eg358pr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=08418895f5e69fd1104c27b73c7a0e003b87a01d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n8eg358pr2e81.png?width=680&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=08418895f5e69fd1104c27b73c7a0e003b87a01d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After alerting folks in the House and Senate of that amendment&amp;#39;s unintended consequences, it was removed from the final bill that passed. Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s back verbatim without any improvements. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It still strips out *all* administrative process and duration limitations on the Secretary’s power to condition or prohibit transactions at financial institutions associated with primary money laundering concerns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time to call your member of Congress and ask that they take action to make sure that notice and comment and duration limitations are not removed from 31 U.S.C. § 5318A as the America COMPETES Act would do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
