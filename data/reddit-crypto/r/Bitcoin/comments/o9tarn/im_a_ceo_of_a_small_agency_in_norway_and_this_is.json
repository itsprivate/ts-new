Hope you find it interesting and a nice addition to your own confirmation bias as to why Bitcoin is and will be lifechanging. Also, thank you for reading.</p>\n\n<h1>First, a couple of caviats;</h1>\n\n<p>- I am not a Bitcoin OG. I didn&#39;t know about it in 2013. I hated it in 2017. I FOMOed in 2018. I was surprised in 2020. And I love and understand it in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>- I am not a financial advisor, and I am speaking on behalf of the company I own which employs just south of 20 people.</p>\n\n<p>- We don&#39;t have a massive treasury and are inexperienced as a company investing in assets and other instruments</p>\n\n<p>- English is not my mother tongue, so bear with me.</p>\n\n<p>- Fuck you Elon.</p>\n\n<p>In this piece I&#39;ll do my best and explain from a small corporate perspective why accumulating Bitcoin became part of the corporate strategy and unanimously accepted by the general assembly.</p>\n\n<h1>Next, some background to who we are as a company</h1>\n\n<p>I founded the marketing agency back in 2017 and we quickly hired alot of people and attracted great clients. Our work is a combination of video production, copywriting, graphic design, web, podcast and everything social media. Basically, we are a marketing department that our clients &quot;subscribe&quot; to for 12 months with certain limitations for a fixed price. Our projected revenue 2021 EOY is about 2,5 - 3M USD.</p>\n\n<p>We are known for being provacative, experimental and the &quot;go-to-place&quot; for small B2B companies to jumpstart their marketing game.</p>\n\n<p>Again, our business model is not very scalable. It&#39;s human trafficking (it&#39;s a joke!!!) - we need one guy or gal to do some work, and that work can only be done so many times in a day. If we want to do more of that work, we need to hire a new guy or gal and so on. And if you don&#39;t have BCG or McKinsey in your logo - the ability to scale on premium price is very difficult as well. The avarage profit margin in Norway in our industry is about 3-4%. Eeeew. The &quot;only&quot; way to make big buck with this kind of business model is either scale massively on people, price or both. The cost that makes up about 85% of the total, is rent for office space and labour cost, so it requires alot to make that happen. It&#39;s very risky to scale an agency business with people if you don&#39;t have alot of cash on hand - which we don&#39;t have.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve been in business like I said since 2017 and so far we have not made a meaningful profit yet. We have OK salaries, but that&#39;s it. We are smart, creative and driven people - so the salary, even though it is OK, it is not extremely good. And we do want to create a company that can pay out significant dividends to make up for the struggle of building, running and owning a company. With current model, that seems to be a stretch medium-term.</p>\n\n<h1>The Pandemic Gave Perspective On Things</h1>\n\n<p>Like most other places, within a week from March 9th to March 12th of 2020, the semantics went from &quot;yeye, I don&#39;t care&quot;, to; &quot;OMFG&quot;. It literally turned most of our business upside down and was a really chaotic experience. The unthinkable paradox happened; everyone wanted to sell something, but none wanted to buy anything. Except fucking toilet paper.</p>\n\n<p>Marketing, and especially external marketing consultants, is not business critical to everyone, maybe even anyone, during a world crisis. And obviously we faced a lot of pushback from our clients. So we are grateful that most stayed with us, but some left. Leaving our business extremely volnurable as we don&#39;t have the liquidity to simply shut down.</p>\n\n<p>A few months in during the pandemic, my partner told me: &quot;Dude, Bitcoin just hit 30k&quot;. We had been speculating somewhat back in 2017 and found crypto to be somewhat interesting, but at the same time a piece of shit idea. And I remember thinking to myself that we were going to see another meltdown like never before with crypto. But, then I started reading about it. I read about Michael Saylor, Tesla&#39;s purchase, banks recruiting experts, ETF&#39;s trying to be accepted, Queen Cathie Woods, white papers, Cointelegraph, Bitcoin Magazine and so on. Not only that, but our very own Kjell Inge RÃ¸kke (one of Norway&#39;s wealthiest) just put 60 million dollars in it and started a crypto company.</p>\n\n<p>I am not the smartest guy in the crypto room, but these guys are - and now I was on my journey of juggling a struggling company during the pandemic, firing bad people and also putting in the first 1000 hours of understanding Bitcoin, the money system and how this will be adopted as a revolutionary technology 5-10 years from now.</p>\n\n<p>And then I realized...</p>\n\n<h1>Why Bitcoin Is Not A Risky Bet (for us)</h1>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve done several bad hires - actually a couple to many because of my own naivity. During the worst period of corona last year we knew that we had 4 bad hires in our organization. That is pretty significant as we were only 15 employees at the time.</p>\n\n<p>This might be a controversial line, but hiring <strong>bad</strong> people is a zero-sum game in which the employee is the winner and the employer is the loser. A bad hire is the true Rat Poison Squared as the faggot would say.</p>\n\n<p>Now, most of you I assume live in the US and I live in Norway. Two completely different hiring/firing laws. In Norway, you simply can&#39;t fire someone &quot;just because&quot;. Making the bad hire outcome even worse, since the process of firing someone that don&#39;t create any value for the company is a tedious process - time consuming, energy draining, lawyer fees and always a &quot;settlement package&quot; including minimum 3 months of salary. I know of entrepreneur peers that simply went bankrupt because of a few bad hires early on that just dragged the process so long that the company didn&#39;t have any liquidity left. And yes, I agree that the employer has a responsibility of not making those mistakes. But, come on bro.</p>\n\n<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make here is that if you have made a bad hire; it is like watching your stock go from whatever price to 0. It literally is a 100% loss. And the chances of getting even the slightest amount of value from a bad hire is also near 0%. Bad hire bad. Good hire good.</p>\n\n<p>So I thought to myself at first in winter 2021. What if we trim our agency to become a truly premium business, work on upskilling people, and invest in what we already have and add a few seniors to our team, and then re-invest the hypotethically cost of bad hires in Bitcoin? Either we double in size and go from about 20 people to 40 and making 5M revenue with 10% margin and along the way waste a shit ton of money on bad hires. Because, trust me, bad hires comes with volume in recruiting. There is no way past it.</p>\n\n<p>Or we invest and accumulate Bitcoin and dream about a 10x return within the next 4-5 years with alot less company risk, governance, stress and hazzle. I liked the latter idea so much that I wanted to pursue it as a core strategy for our company and change my role from being just a &quot;CEO&quot; to Master of Coin. A fun ego boost as well.</p>\n\n<p>I needed to convince the group of equity partners and also the small board we have. And I&#39;d like to share with you guys how I did it.</p>\n\n<h1>Maybe Some Instruments Are Better at Making Money Than All Of Us Combine</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qns9hinnk2871.png?width=1905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2402621c3ce5ef58879e16de759ca3c5f96f8faa\">Introduction</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d6b5qukpk2871.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=671881be5e90d90ec6f470d74f8faa6225fe0545\">Putting it in perspective</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uridajvqk2871.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9d81bf2226b331040ed477468045cef48699cba\">Understanding how quickly \\&quot;things\\&quot; change. Here you see everyone travelling with horses.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ccqca4fsk2871.png?width=1887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33cf6ec9aa185ffa46fffd44b61f7bca90a54870\">Fast forward only 30 years, and we already have buses and the roads are packed with cars. You don&#39;t see big change until it is mainstream.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1ucqvsetk2871.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3e8e317ea0387cc54a580e17140a47c53145510\">People in the mid 90&#39;s were nerds, freaks, geeks for using the internet. And those who didn&#39;t use the internet had 0 clue of what the internet was. Until they did... Sounds familiar too you? Maybe you didn&#39;t give jack shit about Bitcoin a few years ago, but now you do? Same story all over again.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0ulwldeuk2871.png?width=1913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f8d5866f04ca58c86c2be7888a76d7f594f9132\"> Same thing. You don&#39;t understand when it&#39;s mainstream before it is. How stupid was smartphones back in 2005? Yes, because we didn&#39;t have real 3G/4G, apps, internet was in the early stages and bla bla bla. Now, not anymore. </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q2aea6ovk2871.png?width=1913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af0d38664832718fb00a72ea8f616f8fa343759b\"> 15 years ago, you would never believe that you were going to have a digital identity open to the entire world. But now you do. Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, Instragram and many others. In 05-08 all you did was play Zynga poker. </a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7au3kc59l2871.png?width=1925&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39622fd430528abab63592399569eef3f8e7389e\">I explained to my owners that this train is leaving very soon, and everything else that is revolutionary, you don&#39;t see when it is mainstream until it is. Now let&#39;s bet that we can be among the first 5&#37; in a 100&#37; game.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0lkuykral2871.png?width=1924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=816e0dc58064182ec88d2f24209d8d3fd1414867\">Here I gave my partners a simply explanation of how Bitcoin works.
