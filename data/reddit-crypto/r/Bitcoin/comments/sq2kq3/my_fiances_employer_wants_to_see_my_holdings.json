Apparently they have some &amp;quot;Blacklist&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bitcoin will never be on it.&amp;quot;  At this point I might just transfer what I have in Coinbase to my cold storage and tell them I have nothing.  Anyone have a similar situation or ways to get around this?  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you to all who provided insight. I think I’ll transfer what I have on the exchange to my cold storage and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
