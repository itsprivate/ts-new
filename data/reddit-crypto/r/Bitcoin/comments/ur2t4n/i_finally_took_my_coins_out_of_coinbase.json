I even bought a hardware wallet several years ago but was too nervous to actually transfer my coins to it. I figured a big company like Coinbase is probably better at security than I am, so what&amp;#39;s the real risk? A post here last week was what finally pushed me over: pointing out that in bankruptcy, Coinbase could (and probably would) liquidate my coins to pay creditors. While I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s likely that my Coinbase vault would get hacked, I do think there is a much bigger chance for Coinbase to do something dumb on the business side and go bankrupt during some particularly bad market volatility. So I bit the bullet and transferred my coins - other than the excruciating 30 seconds between initiating the send at waiting for it to show up on the other side it was very painless. TL;DR I finally pulled my coins off of Coinbase, and you should too&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
