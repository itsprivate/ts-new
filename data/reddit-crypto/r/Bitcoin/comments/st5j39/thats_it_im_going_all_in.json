Now Trudeau gives them the power to seize funds from crowd-funding sites &lt;strong&gt;and banks&lt;/strong&gt; if they don&amp;#39;t like what you stand for???  HOLY SHIT.  They say it&amp;#39;s temporary, we shall see.  I know what I think about &amp;quot;temporary emergency government measures&amp;quot; based on historical context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the SEC ruling over BlockFi that halts new interest accounts for any American that does not have at least $3m in investible assets is insane.  This will for sure spread to Voyager, Celsius, Gemini...etc.  I believe this is being done in coordination with banks to drive assets back to legacy institutions and prevent the ordinary person from achieving financial security and remain in a perpetual state of monetary slavery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are firmly in the &amp;quot;..and then they fight you&amp;quot; stage.  The walls are beginning to close in on ordinary citizens as their fears of being made irrelevant by this digital peaceful revolution increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need truly decentralized protocols providing these type of financial services now more than ever.  Go get yourself a home mining rig for non-KYC bitcoin, spin up a full node on TOR, stack your sats like an animal, and dig in your heels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fight is upon us and I for one will die on the hill of financial freedom, choice, and sovereignty. I suggest you also act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rant over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
