The CEO issued a press release that said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This sale reflects our awareness that something potentially has changed with Bitcoin… If the system is built on scarcity and faith in the system, then a ‘double spend’ would eliminate both—essentially destroying the store of value it was meant to be. In light of this potential outcome, I have decided to move to cash as this story is still unfolding.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, its only been a month and I want to have a short moment of silence for the money they put to death because those $4 million worth of bitcoin would be worth about $7 million today.  Selling was a $3,000,000 kneejerk mistake which is especially stupid considering that their total revenue for the <em>entire last 12 months</em> was about $3.5 million and their gross profit was only $1.2 million.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
