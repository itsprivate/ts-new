I saved from everything possible... didn’t buy new car ... no fancy gadgets... nothing that is non essential... everything invested back to BTC </p>\n\n<p>I don’t know if I am doing right but yes finally I finally own more than 1 BTC !! I could have a lot more if I invested early or didn’t do stupid things with crypto </p>\n\n<p>But I am happy I finally own more than 1 bitcoin 😀</p>\n\n<p>Please tell me... am I doing this right?
