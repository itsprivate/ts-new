I have achieved a nice return on my investments so far and was more than happy to buy the recent dip at around $42,000. </p>\n\n<p>Back to the fact that 0.1 BTC being a small amount. If you believe that BTC will be the money of the future, only 210 million people maximum could have 0.1 BTC and in reality it is likely going to be much less than that. So I am more than happy to be part of this relatively small club!
