Frozen trading where the only option is to SELL? FUCK YOU. I hope that the class action lawsuit is so nasty that multiple hedge funds declare bankruptcy and personal assets are seized — because, to be clear, the effort by shorting GME 140% of the shares was to put 50,000 people out of work in the middle of a pandemic by shutting the business. It feels personal. It should fucking hurt, really hurt, the perpetrators.</p>\n\n<p>“Retail investor” is such a demeaning phrase — as opposed to “Inside trader?” Suck a fat 🍆.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I’m writing this in Bitcoin chat not because BTC is incredibly equal amongst its owners (it clearly isn’t), but it Absolutely is an alternative.</p>\n\n<p>I went into this year bullish for equities and I still am; however, when free markets force liquid losses from the common man — when asset bubbles have made the already wealthy obscenely filthy rich  — and then they bitch about the rules of their own game? I’m fucking out.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll keep my stocks and inflate them with my already inflated dollars and then happily increase my Dollar Cost Average rate of investment into BTC.</p>\n\n<p>Because equities aren’t equal, though they should be.</p>\n\n<p>Free markets aren’t free, though they should be.</p>\n\n<p>At least crypto, while it might not be free or equal — is fucking MINE. Finally, ownership over an asset that we apparently can have control over. </p>\n\n<p>Damn, I’m angry. Fucking livid. And that’s why I’m digging into BTC harder than I ever have. </p>\n\n<p>The system needs a good fucking. Shall we?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
