I had a GPU that could mine hundeds of Bitcoin a week in 2011 but I rather played Call of Duty with it. Till 2021, I didn&amp;#39;t give a damn about what Bitcoin is but now it is all I research about (watching Greg Foss for Hopium, What Bitcoin Did for philosophy and money Benjamin Cowen for TA)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Started stacking sats from Jan 2021, flipped some shitcoins, DCA&amp;#39;ed monthly into stacking via the lightning network and finally arrived here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Used to hold it in a single account ledger wallet, but did not feel safe because of dictionary attacks. So, now HODLing into sparrow multi sig wallet (2 of 2 both Ledger Nano X). Stored my seed phrase safely burned underground in my backyard in a layer of concrete. HODL mode on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of all, its KYC free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, on to the next goal of 2 BTC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d3lyakg2u6y81.png?width=987&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41b1e652a7462d7fc87036157b01dca4319f6129\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/d3lyakg2u6y81.png?width=987&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41b1e652a7462d7fc87036157b01dca4319f6129&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
