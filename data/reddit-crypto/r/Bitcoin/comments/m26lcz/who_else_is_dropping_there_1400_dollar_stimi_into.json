I heard people talking about putting there original stimi into Bitcoin and have profited massively. Is there some truth to this? Could the process this time around be just as profitable considering how everything is evolved here in the US? Money is dirty and nobody seems to want to touch it(COVID-19), transferring passively without touch is a clean future. Not to mention doesn’t it cost natural resources to go down like paper(trees), inefficient if you ask me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
