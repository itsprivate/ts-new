Even gold tanked and for six long months kept declining alongside stocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then a decoupling happened, after the inital panic where everything got caught up in a global sell off gold reversed and proceeded to rally very strongly for the next 4 years while stocks kept falling. After the initial 6 months of confused panic people woke up and started searching for a safe haven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today we are already in a recession but people just dont realise it yet. Stocks have been falling since November last year, some individual stocks down 60%+, the nasdaq down 30% and the S&amp;amp;P500 just today confirming a bear market by falling more than 20%. And just like 2008 gold has been selling off alongside stocks. This time however so too has bitcoin, which just like stocks has been falling since November last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;History is repeating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months all economic indicators are going to confirm that the world is in a global recession that started in November last year, and everyone will wake up. They will realise whats going on and start looking for a safe haven. Thats when gold and bitcoin will reverse and enter a strong bull market rally over the next few years while stocks keep falling and indexes languish down 70%+ from their November 2021 highs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gold may double or triple in price seeing its market cap rise from $10T to $20T or even $30T. But bitcoin is starting from a much lower $500B market cap and as banks start failing and inflation runs hotter than expected btc will race to equal golds market cap if not exceed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At a bitcoin market cap of $30T one bitcoin will be worth $1.5 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I expect to see gold and bitcoin both decouple from the declining stock market over the next couple of months as a recession is officially confirmed, both beginning a multi-year bull market rally that may last until 2025 taking gold to $5000 per ounce and bitcoin above $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
