I&#39;m only 30 so I know while it is a risk, I still have a chance to recover if it crashes, and I have a full time job anyway. I just thought how the people around me are putting money into their houses, into children and expensive weddings, and they will never get a return on that. It just disappears. I also thought how most people will go their whole life and not take a risk and &#39;go for it&#39;... and when I&#39;m older, I will not be able to things like this. I will be a lot more conservative. Now is the time for me to take a risk.</p>\n\n<p>So I put a total of about $50,000 USD and bought in. I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll keep it in, but I&#39;m thinking at least 5 to 10 years, maybe longer. I haven&#39;t told anyone and I don&#39;t plan to, but I feel good about it. Another thing I think about is that there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever released, and that is NOTHING when I stop and think about it. To me it seems like a great opportunity.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
