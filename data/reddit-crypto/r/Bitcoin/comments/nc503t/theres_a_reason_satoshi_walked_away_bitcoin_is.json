  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It took Bitcoin&#39;s first big media exposure from a PC World article for Satoshi to decide that it was time for him to step aside and let the people take the reins of the most ingenious monetary invention in history.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin finally sets man free from men. It is the culmination of humanity&#39;s 7000-year quest to perfect the representation of money by democratizing its creation and distribution. Nobody is in charge here but everybody is in charge.</p>\n\n<p>Just look at the ongoing Taproot signaling process. For any protocol change to be ratified on Bitcoin, it first requires a super-majority approval from all mining nodes in the largest, most secure decentralized proof-of-work network. Failing this, all the full nodes including non-mining nodes can activate the protocol through UASF, which is what happened with SegWit. So if the miners go against the wishes of the users, the users can overrule them.</p>\n\n<p>There are shitcoins plenty, but not one network out there as secure, time-tested, trustless and absolutely democratic in both development and block generation as Bitcoin. There can never be. Shitcoins are either moving away from proof-of-work, creating wealth inequalities similar to fiat money and making them undemocratic, centralized and less secure or they are largely resorting to centralized consensus models which makes them no different from the current banking system.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2009, in the same period Bitcoin has gone from 0 to 1 trillion, Tesla has been accruing billions in losses and surviving only through government handouts from YOUR tax money. The only reason Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin is because wilfully ignorant mainstream media thinks Bitcoin is bad for the environment and last week Tesla applied for &quot;carbon credits&quot; from the US government, seeking a bigger chunk of taxpayer dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s not even get started on SpaceX. That&#39;s a company built on the ludicrous premise that humans could somehow &quot;colonize&quot; uninhabitable worlds. Everyone who knows anything about astrophysics knows how moronic it is to think we could somehow live on Mars! SpaceX uses 100% fossil fuels. Bitcoin mining is 78% powered by renewables. SpaceX also uses twice as much energy as Bitcoin. Is it as necessary as democratizing money? Don&#39;t get me wrong. We should absolutely protect our world because it&#39;s the only shot we&#39;ve got. But to think we could ever colonize uninhabitable worlds when we&#39;ve never ventured further than the Moon, and not even that in over 50 years, is cuckoo talk.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a weird fascination in humans when it comes to quasi-smart idiot savants. Elon Musk is a privileged, deranged blithering buffoon and slave-driver by birth. He treats his workers like slaves to this day. He attracts attention for being quirky and rich.</p>\n\n<p>Musk knows nothing about anything but likes to pretend he knows everything about everything. Think about the time he said he could rescue people from a cave in Thailand using submarines. Think about the time he said Covid was nothing and people shouldn&#39;t worry about it. Just think about the time he said, with a straight f*cking face, Bitcoin was bad for the environment.</p>\n\n<p>Stop paying attention to self-serving celebrities and morons like Elon Musk trying to make a buck off your back. Bitcoin does not need them. They need Bitcoin. Don&#39;t let these privileged pricks assert their authority over Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin is too big, too sacred and far too important for humanity. We cannot let this slip into their hands.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
