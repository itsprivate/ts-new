I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for fewer &amp;quot;buy the dip&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hodl&amp;quot; and I ❤️ BTC posts.  This signifies to me that folks are very afraid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m feeling very greedy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... I&amp;#39;m also being cautious.  It is quite possible for BTC to move down to around $10k again.  For instance, if this drawback parallels the high of previous bull markets, $12k is in sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I cannot time a bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one can pick a bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can only smell fear.  I buy when I smell fear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, part of me feels like people are not afraid enough.... There are LESS posts about buying at these prices here on this sub... I do believe we will eventually get to a point where there will be none.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, I&amp;#39;ll keep NIBBLING.  Little chunks (5% of my total BTC bankroll at a time).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
