  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been interested in Bitcoin since I heard about it back in 2010, I CPU mined, I GPU mined with my company&amp;#39;s computers (with their knowledge of course). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I amassed a good amount and then when the price started going up at the end of 2017 I realized I couldn&amp;#39;t remember the password I used to encrypt my keys, at today&amp;#39;s price what I have in that wallet would be worth 8 figures. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have literally tried everything to get that password back, including weird things like hypnotism and even ayahuasca. At this point I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s gone, good for you guys I burned about 350 BTC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now on to how it might have saved my house. I kept buying what I could, I was making good money for a time so I was able to buy every now and then. I amassed a huge total of 0.28 BTC, I was hoping to hodl that basically forever, but fate had another plan for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My GF cheated on me, which was devastating because we had been together for 5 years, during that time we bought a house together, and I went into debt to finance improvements and renovations. Now I need to refinance and I&amp;#39;m not making the same money I was when we bought it so I thought I was screwed when it came to qualifying to refinance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to sell my 0.28 about 2 weeks ago and pay off my credit card and some of my line of credit, and now I&amp;#39;m teetering on the edge of being able to refinance and pay the cheater out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no moral to the story except HODL, you never know when you&amp;#39;ll need the money you have invested in Bitcoin, it&amp;#39;s going to the moon so don&amp;#39;t take it out unless you absolutely have to. I wish I didn&amp;#39;t but for the foreseeable future I&amp;#39;m out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really hope I can refinance my house because I worked so hard on this place, I&amp;#39;m paying down my line of credit as much as I can but due to COVID I&amp;#39;m just not making the same money I once was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Don&amp;#39;t go into debt, don&amp;#39;t trust women you&amp;#39;re not married to, and HODL.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
