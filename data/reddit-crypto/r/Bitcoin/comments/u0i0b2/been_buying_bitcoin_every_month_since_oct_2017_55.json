Good progress, but no idea how long its gonna last until I&amp;#39;m &amp;#39;done&amp;#39;. I document my journey in this blog and I think of it as some kinda blueprint for how you can stack yourself into retirement with Bitcoin and how the ride is gonna look like. I can tell you its not linear riding into gains and success, you probably know this much. But I hope these posts give you motivation to keep on stacking and seizing the day with the current prices we have. We all know they are not gonna last forever!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-21-april-2022/\"&gt;https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-21-april-2022/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
