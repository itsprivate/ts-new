No matter your belief, there&#39;s always that little voice questioning if you are mistaken. There&#39;s all the media talking bad of bitcoin&#39;s outlook. There&#39;s all those people in your life telling you how unwise the investment is, how unrealistic your views on the future are, and throwing out convenient numbers to &quot;prove&quot; XYZ stock/metal is a better investment.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s nothing compared to now. All those same people now telling you to take the massive Return On Investment. Loved ones imploring you to be smart and get out while the gettin is good. The &quot;factual&quot; reasoning they used before are now replaced with emotional appeals. All of a sudden media and people are experts about bitcoin cycles. They tell you it will crash... And they are right in a way since it <em>eventually</em> it will dip after reaching some new peak before the next cycle.</p>\n\n<p>For most, the profit would help their lives significantly. Pay down/off a house mortgage, getting a new car, paying off/down debts, etc. For others the current profit is life changing money.</p>\n\n<p>We all know it WILL peak and &quot;crash&quot; to a low that&#39;s still higher than previous cycle&#39;s ATH. That knowledge spawns the brilliant plan to sell then buy lower to increase stacks.</p>\n\n<p>Timing the market is a game of Russian Roullete, tho. You might get lucky a few times, but eventually you lose, and you lose big.</p>\n\n<p>Now is the time to remember why you bought bitcoin in the first place. Be 100% brutally honest with yourself. Ponder the future if it now. Compare that to what you believed when first buying. If there is a difference, find the reason for your change in views. </p>\n\n<p>Figure out which type of person you are. Which would you regret more:</p>\n\n<p>not taking profit if it permanently nosedives</p>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<p>cashing out now at a much lower price and it continues skyrocketing in the next few months/next cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Be realistic on thinking if you do cash out and it continues upward, are you going to buy back in (at the much higher price). </p>\n\n<p>Everyone daydreams and has these thoughts. Especially considering we&#39;re on the second leg of this cycle.. Just like all the previous ones.</p>\n\n<p>Just so you know, it doesn&#39;t get easier. Each cycle is more money and the temptation becomes greater. Each cycle brings more voices weighing in on your investment.</p>\n\n<p>Just be honest with yourself. There&#39;s nothing wrong with taking a profit to improve your life. Just be completely sure if you decide to cash out (now or in the future) it&#39;s because of what YOU want and YOU believe.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
