I got many lessons from the school of hard knocks early on in life. Prolly TMI but fuck it,  never met my dad, mom smoked crack and killed herself in my teens, I joined the army for 6 months out of highschool and quit cause it wasn&#39;t for me, then pipelined for a couple years, then used that money to put myself through school to become a paramedic, and had the opportunity to see humanity in it&#39;s most raw forms.  I only share this because I think it gives me credibility in terms of understanding how humans operate, and human nature in general.  Basically, I&#39;ve been around the fucking block and soaked up many lifetimes of experience compared to the average joe.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always enjoyed reading, and love learning things. It&#39;s probably my saving grace, paired with an observational nature towards life. I&#39;ve learned many lessons, I always do my best to keep my eyes open.</p>\n\n<p>This is probably my biggest observation from an early age.... Since the industrial revolution, the way we have structured civilization has blown my mind. People get caught up on the day to day, and don&#39;t put much thought into it, but the way we have set things up is truly insane. Our model since the industrial revolution is based around compound infinite growth, year over year, <em>forever</em>.  Maybe it will change eventually, but I doubt it will happen in our lifetimes. </p>\n\n<p>You can have a company that makes a 100 million dollars a year profit, which is good, but next year if it makes 100 million dollars in profit (which is still pretty awesome), the stock will tank.  People talk about bull markets, and bear markets, but it&#39;s all bullshit. Compound infinite growth forever, there is no such thing as a &quot;bear market&quot;, only &quot;bear speedbumps&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>When I was a kid, I remember being able to buy 3 subway sandwiches on a sunday with their special for 9.99, now you can buy 1 subway sandwich and a cookie for 9.99 assuming it isn&#39;t a premium sub.  That took 17 years.......</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s the funny thing about inflation, it&#39;s also tied to the compound infinite growth forever model. Anyone that remembers high school math, exponents get pretty wild. They are flat with moderate growth for a long period, and radically turn into hockey sticks. Even with a 2% multiple (inflation is usually 2-3%), over 100 times it starts to get insane.  If you take 100$ and compound it with 2% 100 times you get 724$, and if you compound that 100 times you get 5248$, and if you compound that 100 times you get 38,203$, and then you get 275,466$, and then you get 1,995,656$ and then you get 14,457,828$.....  It escalates fucking QUICKLY. To really drive the point home, if you do the same thing 6 times with 3% instead of 2%, you end up with 5,038,889,366$ (5 billion instead of 14.45 million, with a 1% difference, exponents are so fucking insane!!!!)</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s ok though, because banks can just keep printing out money. Fun fact, banks produce more fiat through loans than governments do. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I think we are at the start of a hockey stick over the next 20-40 years due to wild nature of exponential growth, and where bitcoin becomes fucking beautiful... Is that there can only ever be 21 million of them. We are at 18.8 million of them currently. </p>\n\n<p>I try to do my best to keep up with things and consider myself more informed than most, but honestly... I don&#39;t understand how the economy truly works, I don&#39;t understand how governments and social movements truly work, I don&#39;t understand how currency truly works. I try my best but it&#39;s too fucking confusing, but I 10000000% understand how compound exponential growth works, and  it&#39;s what we have all encompassingly structured our civilization around since the 1800&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>I had a couple whiskeys after getting home from work lol, thanks for reading my verbal diarrhea, bitcoin just finally clicked and I felt like had to share. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Is this gentlemen? (sorry I&#39;m new, hope I did the meme right lol).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
