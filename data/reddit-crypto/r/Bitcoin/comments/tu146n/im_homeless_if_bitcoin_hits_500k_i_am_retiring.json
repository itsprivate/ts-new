I have had a kind of rough life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was young my father left and my whole family became homeless. For the past 5 years I have lived in my car and worked at the lowest paying dead end jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now I don&amp;#39;t have a job. You may ask why and the reason is when you are working a dead end job that won&amp;#39;t give you a raise you make more money quitting and taking a few weeks to find a job paying $1 more per hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can make enough to afford an apartment but because the rent price means they require 3X rent as your income... I don&amp;#39;t make enough for that.... So I can&amp;#39;t get an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have worked and quit and worked and quit and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now My goal is to save up $30,000 and invest it in Bitcoin. That means if Bitcoin becomes 500K then I&amp;#39;ll have $300,000... And I can retire with that in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can theoretically save $15000 in a year working while living in my car so I plan on investing ALL of it in Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
