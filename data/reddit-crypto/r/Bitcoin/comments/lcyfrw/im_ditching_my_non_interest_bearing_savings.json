The macro-economic climate we are living in is unprecedented with the lowest interest rates we have seen in years and the endless supply of helicopter money. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve have struggled to save money in past, and now I understand why. Since December I’ve been saving in BTC instead of cash, whilst maintaining a small emergency fund in cash. Saving has never been easier. I don’t have any urges to spend money, in hindsight can be explained by the fact that I don’t want to let go of any of my precious sats. It’s obvious to me that Bitcoin is the hardest money invented. I want to save in a money (or asset) that is deflationary rather than the continually debased fiat our federal reserve prints. I can’t compete saving just dollars in a zero interest bearing bank account. </p>\n\n<p>I’m at the stage of life that I’m earning a decent living (not earning mega bucks by any stretch of the imagination), but can save around $1,000USD/month. </p>\n\n<p>My goal is not a lambo, or any other silly luxury, but is to have financial independence. One of my medium to long term goals is to be able to secure a future for myself, be able to live in a modest but comfortable home. I want to be able to put a decent deposit on a home in 4 years’ time. </p>\n\n<p>I’m recently debt free (followed Dave Ramsey’s plan to obliterate my student loan debt), and now, it’s time to build my life financially. </p>\n\n<p>So, for one year, I am going to continue this experiment. Every dollar allocated in savings is going into Bitcoin. It will likely continue for many more years. But for now, New Year’s Day - 2022, I will update you all with my progress. </p>\n\n<p>See you next year 😁</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
