  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>We know that institutional investors are buying and buying large into bitcoin lately.  It has been well documented.</p>\n\n<p>The &#39;little man&#39; was the first in the space over the past decade.  In fact, this is one of Peter Schiff&#39;s arguments <strong><em>against</em></strong> bitcoin.  To paraphrase, no major asset was ever jump-started by the uninitiated.  In his views, only the smartest and most edjamacated amongst the wheelers and dealers ever get in on the ground floor of &quot;next big things&quot;.  Bitcoin enabled kids (&quot;stupid&quot; kids of all things!) to buy in and get rich early.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, as the price rises, everyone has this instinctive feeling in their gut that this is &quot;the top&quot;, or that bitcoin is &quot;over bought&quot;.  These feelings are, of course, based on nothing tangible.  And everyone knows this deep down if they&#39;re seriously only engaging the rational portions of their brains.  But that irrational part hits.  That greedy part takes over.  That &quot;I can trade this into more bitcoin&quot; part wins out.  </p>\n\n<p>And people sell.</p>\n\n<p>And now, they are selling to the already rich.</p>\n\n<p>And in just a year or two, the bemoaning will begin in earnest.  Folks will complain about how only the 1% (or the .1%) own any significant amounts of bitcoin anymore.  How the &#39;little man&#39; got pushed out of the market.  Capitalism will be blamed.  Greed will be blamed.  Everything <strong><em>else</em></strong> will be blamed.</p>\n\n<p>But you know, don&#39;t you?  You know deep down whose fault it is.  Satoshi came up with a brilliant method for initial distribution of bitcoin to the masses: mining.  And, for the first decade+, anyone could jump in and claim their stake.  Sadly, that train is now leaving the station.  </p>\n\n<p>Never to return.</p>\n\n<p>So the fault lies with us.  All of us.  All of us who sell not because we have to (to meet current financial obligations -- who could fault that choice?), but because we <strong><em>want</em></strong> to.  We want to game the system.  And we&#39;re gonna fuck that system up doing so.</p>\n\n<p>HODL.  Not for your personal gain, but to keep this priceless resource out of the hands of those that already don&#39;t need it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
