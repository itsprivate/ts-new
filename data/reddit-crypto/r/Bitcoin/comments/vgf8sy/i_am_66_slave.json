There are also implicit taxes that affect me in ways that are a bit more difficult to quantify like inflation (an invisible tax that diminishes the purchasing power for the dollars I keep) and corporate taxes (revenue that could have all or in part gone into employee salaries). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Months prior I listened to a podcast with Robert Breedlove where he discussed the idea that one’s effective tax rate is a representation of how much a slave one is to the state. A statement I felt was bold, but the argument was interesting: what is slavery if not a 100% tax on your time and energy? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to take the challenge and determine how much a &amp;quot;slave&amp;quot; I really am. I reviewed my paycheck, my property tax bill, my monthly purchases and my state tax rate. The result surprised me to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the numbers represented as a percentage of my gross income: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Federal Income Tax: 26.16% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;State Income Tax: 10.66% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Medicare Tax: 2.16% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Disability Tax: 1.64% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Social Security Tax: 9.25% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Property Tax: 4.94% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monthly Expense Sales Tax (@ 7.75% rate): 2.71% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Tax: 57.52%&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that’s just explicit taxes. The latest Consumer Price Inflation print for June 2022 was 8.6%. Simply adding the CPI figure into the sum puts me at a 66.12% total tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For every 3 hours of work, the value created by 2 is taken from me and given to the government. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am 66% slave. How about you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
