So let&#39;s wait, 3, 5, 7 years, and then call me out. Just like I have done in the last 8 years. Guess what? They never show up.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, not only have we been right about this for the last decade, it&#39;s the &quot;spot on, how the fuck did you know that would happen?&quot; kind of right. I myself have gone on national TV a couple of times here in my home country saying Bitcoin is a hedge for the shit show that is going on in the world and that it&#39;s market cap will go to 1 trillion ** way back in 2016.** How embarrasing would it have been if we were wrong?</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not that we know we are right, but it&#39;s because we are not afraid to be wrong, even if a lot of us has put more skin in the game than required. Starting Bitcoin businesses, publicly supporting and talking about Bitcoin in the face of ridicule (talking about Bitcoin in a startup conference or fintech conference in 2014 will get you a few odd looks and dismissive laughs.), and putting what some might consider an irresponsible percentage of our net worth in the asset because we truly believe in its potential.</p>\n\n<p>So to those saying &quot;Who&#39;s gonna buy your Bitcoin at $100K?&quot; I say this: First, I am not selling at $100K, lol. Second, talk to me in 4 or 5 years, feel free to make fun of me if I am wrong <em>this time</em>. The funny thing is, back then when Bitcoin was small, our conviction was already big. What makes you think that will change today?</p>\n\n<p>The Bitcoin network will outlast all of us, this I am sure of. Whether you believe in its potential of you think it&#39;s one big ponzi scheme, when you take your last breath on your deathbed in 30, 40, or 50 years, the Bitcoin network will still be chugging along, making new blocks to add to the chain, as long as the telecommunications and internet networks exist and free people all over the world desire a monetary system that is free from politics and human intervention.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/opacity/bitcoin-1537e616a074\">In the words of Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>: <em>&quot;Bitcoin will go through hick-ups (hiccups). It may fail; but then it will be easily reinvented as we now know how it works. In its present state, it may not be convenient for transactions, not good enough to buy your decaffeinated expresso macchiato at your local virtue-signaling coffee chain. It may be too volatile to be a currency, for now. But it is the first organic currency.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>But its mere existence is an insurance policy that will remind governments that the last object establishment could control, namely, the currency, is no longer their monopoly. This gives us, the crowd, an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.&quot;</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
