Didn&amp;#39;t have much savings, but wanted as much bitcoin as possible. Was reading the early retirement blogs like Mr. money mustache etc. so already was kinda committed to being frugal and saving/investing every month. Started to buy bitcoin every month as much as possible, with the goal of 1 million euro stack and a big fuck you to my boss. Been on that plan ever since. Started to document the progress in this blog. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-24-july-2022/\"&gt;https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-24-july-2022/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
