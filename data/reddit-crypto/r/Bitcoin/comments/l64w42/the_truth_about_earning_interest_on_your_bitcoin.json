So if you think that by holding your Bitcoin in an exchange savings account you are doing your job as a holder, think again. It is quite obvious when you think about It, your Bitcoin is being actively used by short sellers to short Bitcoin, in the best case scenario you are just making their loans cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>So If you are a true Bitcoin maximalist and believer, you will take all your Bitcoin out of any exchange or lending platform.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
