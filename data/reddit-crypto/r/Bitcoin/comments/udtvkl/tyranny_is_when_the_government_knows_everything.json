Government spending, donations, foreign aid can be tracked on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, citizens now enjoy more financial freedom, and can have a good level of pricacy using the Lightning Network.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The government isn&amp;#39;t going to be able to track millions of average people&amp;#39;s transactions on Lightning. This offers a level of privacy comparable to cash. But millions of people can now have their eyes on their government, who&amp;#39;s not going to be able to move millions around unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More privacy for the individuals, more transparency for governments. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I chose that title because it is a well known quote. I do not support coercive governments, elected or not, but if we&amp;#39;re going to have governments I&amp;#39;d rather have the balance of power tilted more towards people and I think Bitcoin will do just that. &amp;quot;Democracy&amp;quot; definitely isn&amp;#39;t the end game for freedom as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
