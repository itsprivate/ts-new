  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Prior to money, we had a loose system of bartering where you would exchange your goods/services for other goods/services. The problem with this system is that if you work harder or smarter than your neighbor, it was a waste because you can only go to the market and trade for the things you need. So even if you had a product that others wanted, they would in turn need to also have the products that you need. But if you had a placeholder to store that extra production, labor, ingenuity, creativity, etc... then you could freely sell as much of your product that the market will bear. This placeholder is a storage of your labor/production which equates to value. That agreed upon storage of value is called money (could be stones, metals, paper notes, or literally anything that the consensus agrees upon). So when you add more money to the supply that is not backed up by this storage of labor/production, it is public debt that either needs to be filled by new growth or it will dilute the existing supply of money (also known as inflation).</p>\n\n<p>For a long time gold was the ultimate, agreed upon storage of value medium. It held this position for over 5 thousand years. In modern times, up until the 1970s, the US and the rest of the world were still using the gold standard (This meant dollars were a paper representation of the gold they could be redeemed for.) Countries would even settle debts directly with each other via gold. However, this system was replaced by a true fiat monetary system when Nixon took the US off the gold standard completely in 1973. It is important to note here that the world has experimented with fiat money starting in the 7th century. I will spare you the history lesson, but every single fiat monetary system has ended in a collapse; only for the world to revert back to gold or some other scare material as a base collateral that the fiat money is then pegged to. </p>\n\n<p>This is why the comparison between Bitcoin and Gold keeps getting made. As you could have a system where Bitcoin is the base layer that other currencies could be pegged to. This way each entity could use their own local currency to deploy their fiscal planning and collect taxes.  Bitcoin is perfect for this right now, which is why I don’t believe people will ever use Bitcoin to pay for trivial things. Bitcoin should be used to store your excess wealth and preserve it. This also protects Bitcoin from being a target for governments, as they would still get their tax cut by people using the local currency. Remember, the only true way to become wealthy is to leverage your skills to provide a good or service that people want. For people who invested in Bitcoin early, they provided the world with a much needed upgrade to our SOV medium, and as such, are being rewarded for helping to grow the network. The value, represented by the price of Bitcoin is of course going to fluctuate over time as the markets dictate. This is because people are going to transfer that stored value placeholder for other goods and services that they need and want; Then others will backfill that supply with their excess value that they want to persevere. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Remember Bitcoin doesn’t make you rich; you make yourself rich by your choices, skills, knowledge, work ethic, luck, etc... Bitcoin just provides the ability to store that value and preserve it for a later date. </p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor. But if I was one, I would definitely tell you not to invest in Bitcoin - but only because I have to send you to an exchange and then I lose my fee.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
