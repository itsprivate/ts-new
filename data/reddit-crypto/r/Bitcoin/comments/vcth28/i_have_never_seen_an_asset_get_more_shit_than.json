In what world are people that obsessed with an asset that they don&amp;#39;t even own? Not to mention that the ENTIRE macro market is in a pullback right now, not just crypto. Yet you don&amp;#39;t see gold, the s&amp;amp;p 500 ect getting anywhere near this amount of shit, it&amp;#39;s only crypto. I&amp;#39;ll never understand it. You don&amp;#39;t want to own it, don&amp;#39;t own it. But who obsesses so much about an asset that doesn&amp;#39;t affect their lives at all is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
