About two weeks ago I recently won a little bit of money gambling and couldn’t transfer it to my bank, I could however withdraw it in BTC and was just going to set up an account on Coinbase and withdraw it when it hit. I didn’t know anything about BTC or crypto (and I still know very little) and after this price drop I started panicking a teeny bit and was confused. I found the subreddit  and started browsing it and I realized, Bitcoin isn’t about making a profit or a quick buck, it’s a slap in the face to the government and banks who think they can control every aspect of our life. It’s a slap in the face to people like Trudeau who thinks they can freeze our accounts because we don’t comply to their every demand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for showing me the real meaning behind crypto and BTC. Going to invest a little more and get a cold wallet soon. F the Gov n F the greedy ass banks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
