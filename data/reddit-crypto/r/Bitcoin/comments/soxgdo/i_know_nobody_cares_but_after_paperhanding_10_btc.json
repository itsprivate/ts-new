In hindsight they weren&amp;#39;t modest at all. I was buying .5 or entire bitcoins every month. Over the next 2 years, I accumulated (and spent) anywhere between 6-12 btc. I wasn&amp;#39;t super detailed with my records at the time, and I spent a bunch of it frivolously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up buying a house in 2016, and I sold the rest of my stack for the down payment, just before the 2017 run up to 20k, so I missed out on all those gainz. Over the next 2 years I didn&amp;#39;t buy anything, but I still watched the market. In 2019 I started buying again. It has taken over 2 years, but I have successfully joined the &amp;quot;10 millionth club&amp;quot; (2.1btc is a 10 millionth of the entire bitcoin economy). To think I had a realistic shot at 21btc if I&amp;#39;d just stuck with it. Ah well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point of this post is to say keep stacking and hodling. We are still early, even though we always feel late. Pretty weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr&lt;/strong&gt; i just dca&amp;#39;d for 2 years and now I have 2.1 btc&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
