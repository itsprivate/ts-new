I know $100 is really small, however, it&#39;s all I can afford right now.  I remember back when BTC was $350 a coin years ago, I almost bought in, and then again a couple years back when it was ~7k, but decided against it both times. Quite a bummer times two, seeing how it turned out, but rather than kicking myself about it, I&#39;m not gonna ignore my instincts a third time.  Better late than never!
