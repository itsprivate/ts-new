If anyone is more uniquely qualified for this task, it is none other than Gary Gensler.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler sees no problem with Bitcoin. Bitcoin did not launch as an ICO, Bitcoin is fully decentralized and has no figurehead behind it so to him, Bitcoin is clean. However, he  wants to make the exchanges comply with existing regulation and be responsible for the tokens listed on their platform and bring consumer protections to users. There are so many scams, fraud and abuse in this industry, he wants to help hold people accountable for them. There are so many altcoins being listed with centralized founders who control most of the supply, they often resemble unregistered securities that just happen to run on blockchain. Those coin founders currently get all the benefits of not legally calling themselves a company, while at the same time get all the practical benefits of being a company. Gary Gensler says you can&#39;t have it both ways, and wants to bring transparency to the industry by demanding transparency behind the actions of  these coin founders and exchanges.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
