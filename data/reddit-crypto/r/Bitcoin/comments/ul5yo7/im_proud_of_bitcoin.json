Look at every other time bitcoin peaked , and then it went down after . This is just the same . However if our low this time is 35k , or even 30k , or even 20k .... how high do you think this thing is going to shoot up to if that&amp;#39;s what we start from ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take it from me , i&amp;#39;m at a major loss . Just be patient . Well done BTC , i&amp;#39;m proud of you . Thank you for teaching me life lessons via this ride .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
