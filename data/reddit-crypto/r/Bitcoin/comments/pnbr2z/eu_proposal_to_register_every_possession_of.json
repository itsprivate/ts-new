The growing governments will take as long as we let them and this is only the first step of registration of everything to in a later stage have the possibility to tax more or be able to make a more fair distribution of wealth if they see needed.</p>\n\n<p>Slowly every freedom and every part of privacy is taken away.</p>\n\n<p>History has shown us every single government will abuse their powers, whether it is money printing, taxing or straight out confiscation, if the right circumstances come along or the wrong person comes to power.</p>\n\n<p>Once privacy and freedom is given away there are no means left to escape a government turning against their population or against any parasitic behavior, it could be called socialism or whatever it always comes down to the fact money will be found somewhere to redistribute.</p>\n\n<p>Let your voice be heard.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
