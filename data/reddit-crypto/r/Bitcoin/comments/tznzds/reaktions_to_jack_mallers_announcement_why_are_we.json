  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was very surprised but also disappointed to see the very mixed to even negative reactions to the announcement of strike / Jack Mallers at Bitcoin 2022. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strike partnered with NCR (NCR), the world’s largest point-of-sale (POS) supplier, and with Shopify to allow payments through lightning. Since this company supplies the &amp;quot;credit cards terminals&amp;quot;, they can add lightning functionality independently from the payment processor (or the seller) just as a general feature. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The customer can spend either USD or Bitcoin and while the seller could technically receive Bitcoin they are likely going to opt for receiving dollars with Strike handling the exchange (as to my understanding after watching the announcement). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Implications are: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin can be spent through lightning network. Likely at various major companies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sellers can save payment provider / credit card fees&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lightning network will be established for (probably mostly) USD to USD transactions and is therefore here to stay. Even if companies do not yet want Bitcoin on their balance sheet this is a      major step towards understanding the merits of the trust in Bitcoin.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this community and the cryptocurrency community in general have nothing better to do than being smart asses labeling reports as &amp;quot;misleading&amp;quot; since Bitcoin doesn&amp;#39;t end up on corporate&amp;#39;s balance sheets. Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People calling it a non-event for Bitcoin. Is that a joke?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People arguably rightfully criticizing Jack Mallers aggressive and unadaped rhetoric. Yes, but that&amp;#39;s really not the big news. He will grow into being on the main stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every other community is proud of achievements and promotes their cause with upvotes for greater visibility.&lt;/strong&gt; We are foolishly discrediting ourselves, bathing in self righteousness. Buttcoin couldn&amp;#39;t have done a better job, even though they are the saltiest community around for missing out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
