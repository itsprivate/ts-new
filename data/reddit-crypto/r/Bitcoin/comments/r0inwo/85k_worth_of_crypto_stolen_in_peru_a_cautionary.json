I&#39;ll keep the story as short as I   can.</p>\n\n<p>I was recently in Peru for a  few weeks traveling  around on vacation. It was an amazing 2.5 weeks  until the last 2 days.  On Thursday, Nov 11th I decided to spend the  last couple days of my trip  exploring Miraflores district in Lima,  Peru. Upon landing at the  airport I got a taxi cab from the airport  kiosk and started making my  way to Miraflores. No more than 2 miles  from the airport, in  bumper-to-bumper traffic, I was on my iPhone  (looking up restaurants in  the area - Lima is a foodie paradise) with  the window rolled down when  all of the sudden ... snatch. Someone  walked up behind me in traffic and  stole my iPhone right out of my  hands through the window.</p>\n\n<p>This is  when the nightmare scenario begins. I was initially annoyed just due to  the  fact my iPhone was stolen, and I assumed the perp was likely just  going  to try and sell it. Now I have to go through that whole mess from  Peru, and get home without a phone etc. All of the sudden it hit me ...  he  grabbed my phone while I was on it, meaning if he was able to keep  it unlocked he has access to my email, 2FA etc. By the time I had the  taxi  driver turn around and get back to the airport, approximately  30-45 mins had passed before I could get back into a wifi zone. Luckily I  had my  iPad (no data just wifi iPad), so I immediately reported my  phone as  stolen and FaceTimed a buddy to help me start closing  accounts, that&#39;s  when I saw it ... an email confirmation from Coinbase  saying &quot;transaction successful.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>HE  WAS IN MY CRYPTO ACCOUNTS, converting some of my holdings and  transferring them to his address. Not just that, but  as he was doing  this he was deleting my email confirmations so I could  not see what he  was doing (even going into my trash folder and perm  deleting them).  Panic set it, but it was too late. Coinbase, Binance,  and Trust wallet  (primarily Trust wallet so I don&#39;t hold much on  exchanges) all drained  and sent to his address. <strong>$85,000</strong>  in  holdings gone in 30 mins. He obviously knew what he was doing. This  was no joe-schmo and he was likely working with someone else. I  couldn&#39;t  believe it - an absolute gut punch. I&#39;m a relatively  tech-savvy person  (moreso than the avg person) and always implement  security measures. I have a metamask as well that he luckily did not go  for or get into, but  he probably could have if he wanted. This guy (or  multiple people) was a  pro, he knew he only had so much time. Didn&#39;t go  for my stocks or bank  accounts, only crypto, and afterwards shut the  phone down and likely  threw it in a river. I&#39;ve played the scenario out  in my head a thousand  times and it&#39;s obvious they stake out that  specific area / targeting  tourists in taxi&#39;s etc. A million things had  to go right for them to  pull this off as fast and efficiently as they  did.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally,  just so  everyone knows, he had my email and Google Authenticator 2FA  (which  were both obviously on my phone) so he was able to act as me.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m devastated. Years and years of saving and investing.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m   not letting this take away from my crypto investing, I&#39;m going to get   back into it but this situation really took the wind out of my sails  and  drained me of most of my money. With that said, any method I can  follow  to try and recoup? Coinbase has been absolutely no help up to  this point. Trust Wallet has been very slow to look at my case, and same  with  Binance US. Is there any other way of reporting this in hopes I  can get at least some of my investment back? Any former Navy Seal  mercenaries or drone ops for hire?</p>\n\n<p>Any  help  would be much appreciated and I will answer any questions to  provide further clarity if need be. Thanks, sers - can&#39;t do much but  pick myself up and get back in the saddle.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR  - phone got stolen in Peru and worst case scenario happened. My wallets  and accounts got drained. Use lots of passwords and don&#39;t stay logged  in to accounts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
