According to Mallers, the service would be available to anybody in the world who has a Lightning Network-enabled wallet, which includes more than 70 million CashApp users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The announcement demonstrates the Lightning Network&amp;#39;s growing popularity. Robinhood announced intentions to integrate the solution into its technological stack earlier today, joining companies such as cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, Twitter, and Block. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lightning Labs, a California-based developer of the Lightning Network, announced a new protocol on Tuesday that it hopes would allow the Lightning Network to accept assets other than bitcoin, such as other household names like Ethereum and the new ones like $Darc, stablecoins and fiat currencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
