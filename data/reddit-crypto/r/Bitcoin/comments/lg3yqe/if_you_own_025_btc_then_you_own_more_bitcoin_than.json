They would just say, sorry not true or give little scenarios that didn’t disprove what I said at all. So before you jump down in the comments to tell me I’m wrong, read carefully. </p>\n\n<p>This is not opinion. It is mathematical fact. There is really no way around it as long as we make two assumptions. </p>\n\n<p>1.) There will be a maximum of 21,000,000 BTC ever. If there is less (which there is) this only proves my point further. \n2.) The population of earth stays at 7,700,000,000 or increases. If the population were to decrease then my numbers would be off a little but it will still hold true. </p>\n\n<p>With those assumptions, the fact is that if you own 0.25 BTC now or in the future... that you own more Bitcoin than 99% of the world. </p>\n\n<p>This is not arguable. There are a maximum of 21,000,000 coins so let’s pretend they are all available. None are lost or in Satoshi’s wallets.</p>\n\n<p>21,000,000 / 0.25 BTC = 84,000,000</p>\n\n<p>That means there are 84,000,000 segments of 0.25 BTC available. </p>\n\n<p>84,000,000 / 7,700,000,000 = 0.010901</p>\n\n<p>So as long as you own 0.25 BTC you own more bitcoin than 99% of the world. You are in the top 1%!</p>\n\n<p>And in reality, we know that only 18.5m have been released. And 1m is in Satoshi’s wallets and they say 3m has been lost. If that’s the case then lower the 21,000,000 to 14.5 million and you would only need own 0.20 BTC to have more than 99% of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Again, there is no getting around this. It is fact. It doesn’t matter if 1 person had the other 20,999,999.75 bitcoins. Your 0.25 BTC means you own more than 99% of the world. You would not necessarily be in the top 1% of bitcoin holders. You simply own more than 99% of the world. It is impossible for you to fall out of that number if you have a quarter bitcoin. </p>\n\n<p>0.25 and HODL.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
