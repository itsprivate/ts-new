I have been researching bitcoin a bit and must say this is above my pay grade. It looks like a roller coaster ride, though profitable in the long term. Would any of you wonderful geniuses out there offer a suggestion? And how does accessing the funds internationally work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you all so much. Totally blown away by how helpful y&amp;#39;all are. Should have mentioned, this is an owner carry sale, so the total sale price stays the same, the lost down payment is made up in higher monthly payments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
