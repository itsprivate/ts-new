I hate how the government takes and takes while it almost impossible to get by with the cost of living and inflation.  I hate how much red tape their is in this space with such high risk and the government benefits by lining the public workers fat pensions. Just had to rant. I do not reccomend people in this space pay their taxes. Reporting is exhaustive, expensive and a WASTE OF TIME.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
