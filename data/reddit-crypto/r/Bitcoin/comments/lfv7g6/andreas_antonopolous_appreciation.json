They deserve the spotlight.</p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to take some time to show appreciation for andreas antonopolous. The average person will never know about him, and the mainstream media will never mention his name. But he has played such a big role in making so many people understand what bitcoin really is. In my humble opinion, we wouldn&#39;t be where we are today without him. </p>\n\n<p>A smart, humble, patient individual with a rare ability to deconstruct and make sense of the most complex of subjects. A true visionary who doesnt care about the financial gains that may come along with bitcoin, but about the potential for this technology to better people&#39;s lives.</p>\n\n<p>If it wasn&#39;t for him, I would have dismissed bitcoin as hype couple years ago. He was the only one who made things click. Thanks to him I saw the light.</p>\n\n<p>So thank you Andreas for all your hard work and passion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
