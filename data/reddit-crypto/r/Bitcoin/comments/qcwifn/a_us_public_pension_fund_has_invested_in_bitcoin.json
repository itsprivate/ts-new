NYDIG has set up a private fund, which it will manage, to acquire and custody the assets on behalf of HFRRF.</p>\n\n<p>“I see this as another tool to manage my risk,” Ajit Singh, the chief investment officer for the fund, told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “It has a positive expected return and it manages my risk. It has a low correlation to every other asset class.”</p>\n\n<p>HFRRF plans to nourish the partnership with NYDIG going forward to allow its over 6,600 benefactors to leverage the suite of bitcoin-focused services provided by NYDIG&#39;s full-stack platform. HFRRF benefactors include active and retired firefighters and survivors of firefighters.</p>\n\n<p>The purchase marks the first-ever bitcoin investment by a public pension in the U.S., which has the potential to benefit HFRRF members significantly over the long run if BTC continues to appreciate against the dollar as it has for the entirety of its lifetime.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
