It was some hell of what felt like an endless stream of FUD that they spread on Apple, which as you may know is only the most valuable company in the world today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here&#39;s a tweet pointing out the early Apple stock FUD days:</strong>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1365671526612221955?s=09\"><strong>https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1365671526612221955?s=09</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>They scared my poor immigrant dad who came to this country with nothing and started investing in his youth, out of his Apple stock in the &#39;97 for a small $40k profit with their endless stream of FUD news lies. That news stopped him from ever investing back into the market.</p>\n\n<p>And that stock he was scared into selling would be worth millions today. I can only imagine how many other people they scared out of that stock and others like it, who could have greatly improved their lives and the lives of their families with those internet tech stock assets.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that experience, I&#39;m never letting them scare me out of selling my Bitcoin. HODL&#39;r and diligent DCA&#39;r for over a decade now, and I will HODL and DCA until my kids can inherit my fortune and become HODL&#39;rs and DCA&#39;rs themselves</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
