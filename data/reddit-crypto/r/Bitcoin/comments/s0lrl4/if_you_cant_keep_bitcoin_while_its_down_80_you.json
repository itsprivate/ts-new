Thanks for the responses, no matter showing criticism or support. I don&amp;#39;t really know why people are comparing this situation to being in a toxic relationship, so I will provide another analogy for the quotes: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have a partner who you have been together for years. Although financially, he/she might not be doing very good, but you know that he/she is TRYING! That&amp;#39;s the main point, there&amp;#39;ll be a great future if u guys stay together. Leaving your partner who is struggling and when they are down is bad...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one more here, you&amp;#39;re supporting a football club and you know, they can&amp;#39;t win all the games. If you leave your club and go on supporting other clubs when your old club is in a bad form, then don&amp;#39;t come back when they start winning because you simply don&amp;#39;t like the club true heartedly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I admit it doesn&amp;#39;t feel good when bitcoin dips, but if u paper-handed, then u wont even have the chance to celebrate the highs. So why not have some hopium!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
