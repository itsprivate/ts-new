I have no college education. A VERY modest income. No help from any loved ones or parents to financially help me through a trade school or something like that. And due to unfortunate circumstances and bad decisions i made when i was a teenager I have a lengthy criminal history which doesnt help with finding ways to land a decent job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would bite the bullet and just take student loans from the government but at this point I genuinely dont see the point, id 100% rather put my faith in Bitcoin and just take a small loan as we venture further down and keep DCA until I have a few coins to my name. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can’t be the only one who’s been thinking this way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this sounds depressing to most but if diminishing returns proves to be true this could be my last chance to actually own something that could be a safety net for me when im older. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My 26th is coming soon,l have many worries about my financial future. I really wish i had a mentor for times like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: \nThanks for all the encouraging words, and also the criticisms! we can all learn something from each other. i know i have learned from all of you. best of luck to everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
