Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Is Bitcoin scarce? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Does Bitcoin continue to improve? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Can a person tell much by looking at price changes over a relatively short period of time? No.</p>\n\n<p>Is Bitcoin&#39;s price volatile? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Does Bitcoin&#39;s price volatility matter to long-term, buy-and-hold investors/owners? No.</p>\n\n<p>Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works? No.</p>\n\n<p>Do many people understand fiat money? Fractional reserve banking? Central banking? No.</p>\n\n<p>Is the current global financial system still based entirely upon fiat currencies? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Is fiat money backed by anything? No, not since 1971.</p>\n\n<p>Is fiat money created from thin air by central bankers? Yes, by the trillions.</p>\n\n<p>Is excessive &quot;money printing&quot; a form of theft? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Do fiat currencies always devalue to zero? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>What about today&#39;s fiat currencies? They are well on their ways to zero.</p>\n\n<p>Did criminal bankers get bailouts about ten years ago? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis? No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.</p>\n\n<p>Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9. No. In fact, today&#39;s situation is even worse than then.</p>\n\n<p>Are banker bailouts still happening? Apparently: recent Fed repo activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity is insolvent. Stay tuned.</p>\n\n<p>Is the economy doing well? For the top one-tenth of one percent, yes. For the rest, the bottom 99.9% - with few exceptions, no.</p>\n\n<p>Are there asset bubbles due to central bank activities? Yes, in stocks, bonds, real estate, fine art, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Do asset bubbles always pop? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Is there negative interest rate debt? Yes. Many trillions, and growing.</p>\n\n<p>In all recorded history, have there ever been negative interest rates? No, not until very recently.</p>\n\n<p>Are negative interest rates a strong warning signal. Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Is Bitcoin better than fiat money? For getting paid and buying groceries, not yet. For long-term, buy-and-hold investing, yes.</p>\n\n<p>Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than stocks? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Is Bitcoin better than bonds? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than real estate? Until the current bubbles pop, certainly. For all time? Yes, because real estate has significant holding costs, real estate can be confiscated, real estate is a sitting duck for high taxes.</p>\n\n<p>Is Bitcoin better than gold? In many ways, yes. Overall, for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Should people panic and sell their Bitcoin holdings because of a sudden change in price? That&#39;s not for me to decide. Still, I learned a long time ago not to panic.</p>\n\n<p>Has Bitcoin seen sudden and significant price changes in the past? Yes, both up and down.</p>\n\n<p>What is Bitcoin&#39;s long-term ROI? More than 100% per year, on average.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any reason to believe the long-term ROI trend will continue? Read this post again, from the top...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
