Well here is your opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see many comments such as &amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t catch a falling knife&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s still dropping, and could drop to $10k or $5k, so wait until then&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t be a fool buying now&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Take your losses and run&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Come back in later&amp;#39;, etc. However, purchase small amounts often (or stack free satoshis from sites now offering more as the price drops), ignore the noise &amp;amp; FUD, and stick to your &lt;strong&gt;long term&lt;/strong&gt; plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will you regret buying small amounts often in 10 or 20 years time when you look back to this year and see how many sats you stashed up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If Bitcoin goes to zero, it&amp;#39;s not the end of the world and shouldn&amp;#39;t be the end of your investments (diversify), and don&amp;#39;t invest money you can&amp;#39;t afford to lose.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If Bitcoin goes to $100k, $500k, or more in the next 10 years, you won&amp;#39;t regret it, and obtaining one bitcoin/BTC will become only obtainable by millionaires.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember most of us didn&amp;#39;t get in early, but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean you have missed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy Down 69 from 69 day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
