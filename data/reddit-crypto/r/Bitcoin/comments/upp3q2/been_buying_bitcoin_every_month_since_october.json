Was really bummed I found it so late and it was too late to have any sizeable amount of bitcoin anymore. Decided to buy as much as possible and tightened the budget to buy maximum amount every month. Been doing that for 56 months and gonna continue until my stack gives me freedom/security enough to quit the fiat hamster wheel. Decided to document my journey in a blog. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-22-may-2022/\"&gt;https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-22-may-2022/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
