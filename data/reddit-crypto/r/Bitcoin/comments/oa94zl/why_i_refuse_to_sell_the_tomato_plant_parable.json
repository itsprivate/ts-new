I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll even have the energy to make the trip home to see my family. </p>\n\n<p>My plant has a few small tomatoes on it, barely edible. They would maybe get me through a couple weeks or a month, but I know I&#39;d be better off waiting until they&#39;ve reached maturity before eating them. If I can wait that long, their sustenance will keep me going for much longer. </p>\n\n<p>My plant has a few small leaves on it, should I eat them to tide me over? Skim a little off the top? No.  That would hinder my plant&#39;s ability to fully ripen, and the nourishment I&#39;d get from its leaves isn&#39;t anywhere near that of a fully grown tomato plant. </p>\n\n<p>So I will be patient and wait until my plant has fat, red tomatoes before harvesting. And even then I&#39;ll save some of its seeds to plant each spring, giving me a bigger and bigger harvest each year. I might be late in making a trip back home to be with family, but at least I&#39;ll show up nourished from patient endurance and not emaciated from unripened opportunity. </p>\n\n<p>F</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
