Most bitcoiners said to stay away from other coins, that they weren’t decentralized and safe. At the begging I didn’t understand, even believed that other coin could be better. But as the years passed and learned more about bitcoin, it made more sense (bought E.T.H only once for $40, sold for 45$ lol). Unfortunately, these past few days are a catastrophic example that many people are learning the hard way why you shouldn’t put considerable money on shitcoins. But that’s the free market, nobody is going to bail you out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, thanks to all the bitcoiners that taught me to stay away from other coins, stay safe and stacks sats!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
