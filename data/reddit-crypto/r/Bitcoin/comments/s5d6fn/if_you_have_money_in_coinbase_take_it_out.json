The hacker somehow was able to change my phone number for two-factor authentication therefore I am unable to access the account or even freeze or close the account. When calling Coinbase help, I cannot reach a human for help. Numerous emails result in automated responses pointing me to self-help pages and FAQs. This is unacceptable! How can Coinbase be a publicly-traded company?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I simply want to regain access to my account and have no way to do so. Looking over at ethscan, it looks like my account is being used for incoming and outgoing transactions without my consent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Coinbase wants to be a leader in Crypto, then it needs to demonstrate solid customer support. Right now there is less than zero support. It’s dangerous and too risky to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
