Learned a valuable lesson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you watch your portfolio drop past 50 percent it has an affect on you. I&amp;#39;m at the stage where I&amp;#39;ve accepted that this was meant to happen as a learning experience but it also solidified my determination for long term savings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it&amp;#39;s a good thing because I would have spent the money on bullshit had I sold my gains before the crash. I&amp;#39;m now taking a 10 year view on this technology. I hope to god that I&amp;#39;ll not need any of it in the near to mid future - that&amp;#39;s the only thing I worry about on occasion but at the same time I&amp;#39;ve always worried about retirement and having nothing in the bank when I&amp;#39;m too old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See you guys on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
