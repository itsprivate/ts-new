Bitcoin fixes all of these because they are completely irrelevant on a Bitcoin system. In economics 101 they teach you that the definition of an efficient market is one where &lt;strong&gt;all information is transmitted perfectly, completely, instantly, and for no cost&lt;/strong&gt;. Bitcoin dramatically increases efficiency in banking and will inevitably become the standard medium of storing money/value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food for thought:&lt;/strong&gt; Customers will often ask for their pay checks to deposited as cash. If we can tell the check is legit or if we&amp;#39;re familiar with the person(kyc) we&amp;#39;ll deposit it as cash even though the check is from another institution, meaning in reality the receiving bank isn&amp;#39;t getting anything besides a piece of paper and a promise that the account on the check is good for the funds. Verifying those funds takes a business day or more, but meanwhile the funds get poofed into the persons account at the click of a button. Also as many of you know, since March 2020, deposit institutions are now required to keep 0% of their total deposit accounts in cash reserves. Zero percent! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s why when I hear someone say that Bitcoin isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;backed&amp;quot; by anything, my question is what the hell is a dollar backed by besides dirty green rectangles with some old guy&amp;#39;s signature?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
