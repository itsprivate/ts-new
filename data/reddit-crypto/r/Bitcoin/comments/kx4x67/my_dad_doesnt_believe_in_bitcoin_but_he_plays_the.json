It would make him worried that I have some money in cryptocurrencies (even though it&#39;s an amount I&#39;m okay to invest or even lose). I could say lottery is his &quot;péché mignon&quot;. But as long as you don&#39;t win anything, in a rational point of view, it&#39;s not as good as btc. Sorry if I expressed myself incorrectly, I love my dad !</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
