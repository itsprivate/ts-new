His sizable business runs on global online payments via legacy rails. We lost regular contact the past year or so but recently we started talking again and bonding over bitcoin. He got spooked by banking and by inflation and has converted 90% of his (significant) fiat wealth to bitcoin. We talk bitcoin a lot now and as a former aeronautical engineer, he gets it. Very interesting to see a guy as successful and intelligent as him make the switch to a bitcoin standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we talked more about bitcoin, I started bringing up the Lightning Network. He had no idea what it was. I texted him and said: “download Muun wallet, go to lightning.store and buy something with satoshi’s from your Muun wallet.” He texted me 4 minutes later and his text just read: “Game over.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a man who knows and has used legacy / fiat payment systems to build a multi-million dollar online tutorial business. He is very familiar with what exists and it’s limitations. He immediately understood why Lightning is a game changer from one use. I felt it was an extremely promising moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
