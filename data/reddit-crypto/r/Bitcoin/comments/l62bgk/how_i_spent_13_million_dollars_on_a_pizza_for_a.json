So here you go when Bitcoin was just over a dollar, ($1.13)\nI played an Online game With a friend who lived in Norway, the game was EVE online. We had been playing that game since 2004, and one day me and my roommate who also played EVE ordered pizza one day after work, and our Friend, will Call Him &quot;Griff&quot; he Wanted one too. So me and my roommate pitched in to buy him a pizza as we just got paid and felt generous, but it was hard to do a currency exchange with no fees and without waiting, so I found a website that sold Bitcoin, but minimum was 100, a total of 113$,  and then convert BTC into viking bucks, then into intercontinental space pizza 🍕... And it ended up costing around 43 Bitcoins to accomplish that.. so in total.\n43btc x $32.000 = $1,376,000 😅😅 </p>\n\n<p>But Here is the kick in the teeth for the one time use of the bitcoin purchase.. \nI never used the other 67 Bitcoin ... that&#39;s sitting in a wallet on some website or email or hard drive that may or may not exist anymore and have no idea where or how to get access to it.. 🤷 \nThanks for reading, I&#39;m still sad.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
