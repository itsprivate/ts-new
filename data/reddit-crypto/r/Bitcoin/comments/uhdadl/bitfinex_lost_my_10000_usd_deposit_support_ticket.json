I have been in constant contact with Bitfinex support and my personal bank. The former keep giving me opaque excuses as to why my funds have not been credited to my account. Before they ‘couldn’t locate my funds’, now they claim to be able to see the funds but their bank ‘isn’t replying’. They literally couldn’t care less about me and my funds. My bank have exhausted every option to attempt to recover my funds - they say that the receiving bank have been uncooperative. I have a letter from my personal bank confirming that the funds were successfully sent, and I have an ‘official’ letter from Adrian Capron at Deltec Bank &amp;amp; Trust claiming that they have not received my funds (even though Bitfinex have since said they can see the funds).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a warning to all - &lt;strong&gt;stay away from Bitfinex, Tether, Deltec&lt;/strong&gt;. It is also a call for help - does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can rectify this situation? Has this happened to anyone else recently? &lt;strong&gt;Any cross-community reposts would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/strong&gt; I have seen similar cases where publicity has resulted in a resolution. I will not stop until I have my money back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since my funds vanished, I have looked into Bitfinex, Tether, and Deltec, it seems that Bitfinex have previously lost client funds, as their off-shore bank accounts were frozen by authorities for corporate fraud. Apparently Bitfinex kept client funds all in one commingled account. Then ensued cases of clients not being able to withdraw funds - Bitfinex&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;denied&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;this claim. I knew tether was not fully legit, but I wasn’t aware of really how fraudulent the organisations were.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
