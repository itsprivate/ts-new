This was attributed to blackouts that have been instituted in China. As we know, Chinese miners control the overwhelming amount of Bitcoin hashrate (a concern I have raised in the past). Of course, a collapse in hashpower not only creates FUD about network security but it also means that transactions slow to a crawl</p>\n\n<p>2️⃣  Rumours (or FUD) that the US Treasury would be charging financial institutions for using cryptocurrencies for money laundering. So far, these are unconfirmed and I can&#39;t see any official sources. Either way, it spooked some weak hands who then may have dumped. </p>\n\n<p>3️⃣  Massively overleveraged longs. Highly leveraged positions can lead to a cascading impact of further liquidations. That is because when an exchange liquidates a losing position, they have to sell the underlying cryptocurrencies and convert into USDT. This selling pressure itself leads to further falls in the price and hence liquidations. </p>\n\n<p>So, from my read of the situation, it appears to be because of FUD that leads to a small correction which is exacerbated by the leverage in the market. </p>\n\n<p>I think this should further illustrate the risks that come from trading with leverage. It is often shilled as a method to easily multiply your crypto gains whereas the reality is often quite different. </p>\n\n<p>Anywhoo, that&#39;s a bit of a market update. I am not too phased by it if I’m honest.😉</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<p>Hashrate Fall 👉 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1383687732082348032\">https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1383687732082348032</a>\nMiners Collapsing 👉 <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china\">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china</a>\nChinese Miner Control 👉 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qctnB6DHMLA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qctnB6DHMLA</a>\nRumous of Treasury 👉 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fxhedgers/status/1383611847144730626\">https://twitter.com/Fxhedgers/status/1383611847144730626</a>\nLeverage Being Rekt 👉  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1383757303099232263\">https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1383757303099232263</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
