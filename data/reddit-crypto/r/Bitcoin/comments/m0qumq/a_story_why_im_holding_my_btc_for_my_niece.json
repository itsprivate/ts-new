I’ve been stacking 100 a month for her for when she’s a grown up for over a year now! My plan is to use the Bitcoin to give her a decent education, or a house deposit. That way she will never have to worry about homelessness and can avoid the life I had. Every time I deposit, I think of her and the life me and sis never had. I’ll keep going until she’s old enough, and I’ll surprise her (if it’s not spent on her education) with a large amount of electronic gold. I’ve not told any friends nor my sister about this, and I feel like a cunning evil mastermind. Thanks for reading.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
