So much so that I try to take concentrated pullbacks and stop myself from just nodding my head and agreeing with everything he says. Otherwise, I find myself falling into confirmation bias.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are the best legitimate criticisms of Michael Saylor that you know of? Stuff that would make you pause and perhaps rethink how optimistic he is or reframe him as what he is...just a guy?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
