  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been buying Bitcoin every month since late 2017. Nearly always with the same amount, few exceptions when I got a bonus from work etc. Basically, I wanted to go all-in but didn&amp;#39;t have any savings, so decided to buy with max amount that I can, every month from the salary. I kinda had the idea of stacking my way to a million dollars (or euros), however long it would take. Because the way I see Bitcoin, I have no doubt it&amp;#39;s gonna happen. Sooner if I stack more, and later if stack less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw stacking sats become a meme and people posting screenshots on Twitter. But I felt like the bigger picture was missing. How much can you achieve by simply stacking sats all the time? This is my idea of a blueprint. I stack with certain amount and have been doing it for a certain while. You can take a look at the progress and get and idea how it would work for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, its gonna take time. And its gonna require patience and nerves. Bitcoin is gonna test you, and there&amp;#39;s no shortcuts to success. My advice: start stacking, keep stacking! Promise yourself to stack at least 4 years before you even think about giving up. I document my journey here in the blog. Enjoy reading and I hope you have great success stacking sats!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-19-ferbuary-2022/\"&gt;https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-19-ferbuary-2022/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
