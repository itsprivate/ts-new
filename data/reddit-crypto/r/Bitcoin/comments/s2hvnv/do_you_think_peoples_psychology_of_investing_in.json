But if the price was being presented and talked about in terms of Satoshis would a lot more people be willing to invest? Would we get more of the shitcoin investors willing to buy into bitcoin? I know the math is all the same, but the psychology of investing $100 and getting 0.0022727273 of something (btc) doesn&amp;#39;t seem as appealing as investing $100 and getting 227,272.73 of something (sats) does. And I think a lot of people who invest in shitcoins like that they can own thousands or millions of something and hope the price rises. If people looked at the price of 1 sat (0.00044) would they be more or less willing to invest? Curious what people think about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
