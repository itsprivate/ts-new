I’m asking for peoples opinions if it’s a good idea to do what I’m doing. I understand the fundamentals and systems behind Bitcoin, but I’m still learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t probably the type of post you see everyday, but I just wanted to ask others opinions on my idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I already know how private/public keys work, (I use SSH and PGP keys) and I know pretty much all about the fundamentals of how bitcoin works. I also have 3 hardware wallets, two ledgers (S plus and X) and a Trezor model T. (Don’t ask why I have so many)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided that I’m going to start stacking my coins in BTC, and save them for my future. I’m also wondering what other people’s thoughts are on this, personally I think it’s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: Scammers, don’t DM me, you just make yourself look like a dumbass and entertain me in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Thanks for the awards!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
