We put our money into Bitcoin to have strength in the face of a financial downturn, but if you are holding Bitcoin right now, it&amp;#39;s hard to find other investments that have been hit harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess this is my whiny panic post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
