We are not planning on shutting down <a href=\"/r/AskReddit\">r/AskReddit</a>, as other subreddits have been doing, because we think that continuing to provide a forum for discussion is valuable.  We hope that the admins will be more forthcoming with information about the situation - we&#39;re currently as in the dark as everybody else is.</p>\n\n<p>We do want to note that while we are not shutting down or removing mentions of Aimee Challenor, our normal rules <strong>still apply and will be enforced</strong>.  Posts or comments about the situation are allowed so long as they don&#39;t violate the rules, but using the situation as an excuse to farm karma, spew transphobic rhetoric, or doxx people will not be tolerated and will result in removals and bans, as always.  Our normal rules also apply to posts that are not asking open-ended discussion questions.  We have removed several posts today because they were not questions, or were yes/no questions.  Please read over the rules before posting so as to ensure your post follows them.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Please see an update from the site administrators <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/\">here</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
