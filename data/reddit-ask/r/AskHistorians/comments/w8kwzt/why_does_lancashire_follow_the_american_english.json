For what the rest of the UK would designate as pants, we just use the term underpants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This raises several questions from me. Why is there this one seemingly specific exception to the rule? And why/when did the area using the exception align with North America on this? The words pants comes from the French pantaloon (aka trousers), so I would assume that most of the UK would have used this term originally for that purpose. So when did that switch happen, and why did Lancashire hold out? And why was it only the Lancashire version that was imported to America (assuming the switch happened before NA migration)? Is it because of the prevalence of Liverpool as a trading port in the 19th Century?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trousers seems to have originated from a Celtic word so would logically be the originla term, so why would Lancashire diverge?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
