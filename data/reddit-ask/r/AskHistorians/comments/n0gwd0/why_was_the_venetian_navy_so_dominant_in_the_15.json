The Ottoman Empire had more than 100 times the landmass and more than 100 times the population of Venice.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/mzydj1/the_ottoman_empire_in_1593_gregorian_oc/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/mzydj1/the_ottoman_empire_in_1593_gregorian_oc/</a></p>\n\n<p>And if the Ottomans were not wealthier than the Venetians.  They were definitely not poor as they controlled all trade between Europe and Asia.  My point with all this.  Is that the Ottomans should have had the resources to take Venice.  </p>\n\n<p>Sure, the Ottomans were more experienced with land warfare.  But I am just not understanding this.  Why was the Empire never able to take the city of Venice? </p>\n\n<p>Were the Venetians just unbeatable on the water?  Did the Ottomans not wish to take out the Venetian Republic?  Were the Ottomans genuinely unable to build a naval force to rival Venice?  Were Venice&#39;s allies so powerful that the Ottomans could never hope to approach the city?  </p>\n\n<p>Please help me understand this, I would also appreciate recommendations on good books from the era.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
