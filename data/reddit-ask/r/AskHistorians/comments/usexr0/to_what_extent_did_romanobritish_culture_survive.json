  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in the fate of the Romano-Britons and the vestiges of Roman culture on the island of Great Britain in the period following the departure of Roman authorities and during the formative years of Anglo-Saxon settlement. My rough understanding drawn from media such as The Last Kingdom and other fictional depictions of the period was that the future Welsh/Cornish peoples held onto a sense of their Roman-influenced heritage long into the period of Germanic occupation. Indeed, the consensus appears to be that most famous Welsh folk legend, that of King Arthur, seems to be widely held to be a corruption of legends surrounding the lives of post-Roman Britonnic leaders fighting the investing Anglo-Saxons. However, the &lt;a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Roman.Britain.Romanisation.jpg\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; heading the Wikipedia article on Romano-British culture seems to indicate that the future Wales and Cornwall were among the least romanized regions of Roman Britain. Later in the same article is another &lt;a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Britonia6hcentury.png\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; showing that the Britons has already lost control of the most romanized areas of the island by the 6th century and we’re beginning to be restricted to Wales, Devon, Cornwall, the Lake District, and Galloway. This leads me to a few questions. If the areas where Brittonic language and culture survived after Anglo-Saxon settlement were the least romanized areas of former Roman Britain, then to what extent was there any influence of Roman culture on the medieval Britons? And, what happened to the Britons in those more Romanized areas which were settled by Anglo-Saxons? Did they move west and north to join their brethren, or were they subsumed by the Germanic newcomers? And, given that Christianity (brought to the island by the Romans) survived amongst the medieval Britons but did not make substantial inroads into the Anglo-Saxons until the Gregorian Mission, did Christianity itself carry cultural connotations of “Roman-ness” to the Britons who practiced it in the early medieval period? I’m generally interested in anything and everything related to this topic, so if you have something to add about it even if I didn’t explicitly ask, please enlighten me anyways!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
