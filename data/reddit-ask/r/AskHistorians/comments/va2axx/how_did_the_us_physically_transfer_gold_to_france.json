For example, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase\"&gt;the Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; about it currently states that the US &amp;quot;shipped the gold to France&amp;quot; as if that was as simple a matter as heading down to your local UPS Store. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How exactly was this accomplished, specifically when things like a $3m lump sum down payment gets mentioned? It seems quite risky security wise for a young nation to transport that amount of gold to a ship, then trust the ship to transport it across the ocean, and then transport it from the ship to the French government, not to mention the risk of the ship sinking or getting lost at sea. It seems like the mechanics of this would be quite interesting and potentially have interesting stories around it, but anything I can find just attaches a handwavy footnote at best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This question could apply to pretty much any historical event before the era of modern technology where a large sum was paid by one entity to some other entity far off, but the Louisiana Purchase was what specifically triggered this question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
