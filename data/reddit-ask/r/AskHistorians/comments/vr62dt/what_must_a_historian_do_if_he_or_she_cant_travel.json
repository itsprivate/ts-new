My question is: What do you do? Is research and writing impossible for some places? Are historians disadvantaged by a lack of travel in some ways? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in a bit of a pickle myself - I want to write and do further study about Russia, Ukraine &amp;amp; Belarus (especially about Orthodox Christianity) but there&amp;#39;s no way I can travel there under these circumstances! I&amp;#39;ve never been there, too. As I&amp;#39;m quite young, there&amp;#39;s a concern I&amp;#39;ll be taken less seriously compared to those who travel. The good news is that I have broad, similar interests, such as countries in the Caucaus mountains as well as the Byzantine / Ottoman empires. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
