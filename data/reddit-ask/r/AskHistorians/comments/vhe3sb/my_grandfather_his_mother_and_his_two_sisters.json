Here’s the story I got and I was wondering if this makes sense because I haven’t heard of Germans being in work camps before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was young when WW2 was going on and apparently him, his mother and his two sisters ended up being in a work camp for like 4-5 years. They were Germans and not any of the groups that I associate with going to camps when I think of WW2. My mom told me that they had some parts of these camps where they would keep German families together and this would be like the public facing part of camps where much worse stuff was likely happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this sound right? Were Germans put into work camps as well?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
