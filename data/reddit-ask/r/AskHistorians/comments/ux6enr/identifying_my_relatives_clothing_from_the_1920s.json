The family was from Louisiana, and these photos are taken there in the 1920s.  The woman is my great grand mother (the man on the other side of the photo is her brother)  and the third photo is her wedding day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are these pretty standard dresses for the time period or are they something more traditional?  And if they are traditional of some kind, what culture would they likely be stemming from? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for your insight!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: her brother is in some kind of a military uniform--that I do know&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/KKJtrPx\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/KKJtrPx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
