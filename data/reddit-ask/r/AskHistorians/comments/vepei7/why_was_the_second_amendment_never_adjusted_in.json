  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second amendment says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s my understanding that the primary, original purpose of this amendment was to ensure that the federal government would not infringe upon the rights of the individual states to maintain and arm their own respective state militias.  It is also my understanding that the second amendment does not directly address private gun ownership by individual citizens; the second amendment pertains to private gun ownership only implicitly to the extent that militiamen were traditionally and legally expected to be armed via their own private purchases of firearms.  As has been asserted in Supreme Court opinions such as those of &lt;em&gt;Nunn v Georgia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;US v Miller&lt;/em&gt;, the right of private gun ownership served the ultimate purpose of being conducive to the raising and maintaining of a well-regulated militia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the Militia Act of 1903 essentially dissolved the institution of the civilian militia which had existed from the beginnings of American history.  The Act formally established the National Guard as the official substitute of the civilian militia, permanently relieving ordinary civilians of the militia conscription and militia duty long-established by the Militia Act of 1792.  The Militia Act of 1903 thus appeared to have essentially orphaned the second amendment.  The second amendment was now a statute about the civilian militia in a world without the civilian militia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, despite this &amp;quot;orphaned&amp;quot; status, the second amendment still exists and thrives.  It has never been altered, repealed, or amended.  Interestingly, in the &lt;em&gt;US v Miller&lt;/em&gt; Supreme Court ruling, which took place in 1939 -- well after the Militia Act of 1903 -- Justice McReynolds upheld the original purpose of the second amendment when he defended the National Firearms Act:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Court cannot take judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches long has today any reasonable relation to &lt;strong&gt;the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia&lt;/strong&gt;, and therefore cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees to the citizen the right to keep and bear such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a &amp;quot;shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length&amp;quot; at this time has some reasonable relationship to &lt;strong&gt;the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia&lt;/strong&gt;, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary &lt;strong&gt;military equipment&lt;/strong&gt;, or that its use could contribute to the &lt;strong&gt;common defense&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it strange that the judges in &lt;em&gt;US v Miller&lt;/em&gt; would come to this ruling, which pertains to the militia, when the militia was no longer in existence.  It was almost as if the judges were in denial or delusional, interpreting the law based on a dead institution.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is essentially this: Why was the second amendment -- whose purpose revolved around the civilian militia system -- never adjusted in any way after the Militia Act of 1903?  Why was it never altered, repealed, or amended in light of the reality of a militia-less world which undermined the fundamental purpose of the second amendment?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
