  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi there,</p>\n\n<p>I found a really interesting piece of dialogue in a Chinese drama I&#39;m currently watching, and since all the search results were related to concubinage/the Imperial harem, I was hoping I could get some clarification here. I do of course know that dramas aren&#39;t always the most accurate about history, but in a drama meant to showcase traditional Chinese arts and history, I&#39;d be pretty surprised if this detail was entirely made up and made it through censorship. </p>\n\n<p>The drama takes place during the Qing Dynasty, but the practice seems to be antiquated or at least uncommon at this time. The family involved in this practice is led by a wealthy and powerful government official.</p>\n\n<p>You can see <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?t=2285&amp;v=nJ9cAFxu4Hc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">the clip here</a> with both Chinese and English subs (turn on CC). It&#39;s a very short conversation at the 38 minute mark, ends around 39:40 (major spoilers for the drama after 40:20) The most relevant parts of the conversation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Matriarch: My daughter was born when my husband became an imperial scholar. She&#39;s been spoiled from a young age, but now she&#39;s of age for marriage. I don&#39;t want to exaggerate, but she&#39;s never left her bed.</p>\n\n<p>Merchant: Women of Jiangnan are praised for not touching the ground, it&#39;s been a long time since I met a girl like that. I&#39;m surprised she still follows the Admonitions. </p>\n\n<p>[.....]</p>\n\n<p>Child: I wish I could stay in this bed forever.</p>\n\n<p>Matriarch: When you get married, the bed will go with you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If anybody has any information or can identify a name for the practice from the Chinese dialogue, I would really appreciate it.</p>\n\n<p>Also, while I&#39;m here, I would love some good recommendations for further reading on women in Chinese history — I&#39;m interested in both famous/powerful women, as well as information on what daily life was like.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much for reading!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
