Obviously Solomon himself is a legendary figure and the historicity of all these wives should be taken with a grain of salt, but the fact remains that the writers assigned some special significance to having a lot of concubines in addition to all the wives. However, in other cultures where a ruler could have hundreds of wives the distinction between &amp;quot;wife&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;concubine&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t so distinct. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I suppose the true question is-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was such extravagant polygamy an accepted practice among ancient Israelite rulers? (Obviously &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why distinguish wives from concubines when there are already hundreds of wives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The taking of foreign wives is seen as a flaw of Solomon&amp;#39;s, so is the taking of so many wives and the taking of concubines meant to be seen as a flaw too?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
