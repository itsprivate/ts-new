This is often presented as a clear cut case of assassination as how could a person possibly shoot themselves twice &quot;in the back of the head&quot; as the situation is popularly summarized.  I have no problem seeing the CIA doing horrible things to remove a threat but once the story was already out and Webb famous it also seems that doing something as brazen as killing him seems unpragmatic.  </p>\n\n<p>Are the medical reports clearly convenient lies?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
