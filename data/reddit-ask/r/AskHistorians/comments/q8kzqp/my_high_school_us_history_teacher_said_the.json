She said there was little in the way of societal pressure or persecution for the Puritans in Britain.  Instead what they faced was a country which simply didn&#39;t care for their way of life and resumed a secular life.  This persecution complex eventually led to the Puritans seeking to found Plymouth and spread from there where they could finally be in power again and be free to fully persecute anyone who refuses to adhere to their lifestyle.  My question I suppose is two-part, how accurate was my teacher&#39;s portrayal of the broad generalizations that led post-Restoration Puritans to flee to the New World?  The second part has this perceived persecution, or persecution complex, traveled from those early Puritan settlers through all the great eras of American history?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
