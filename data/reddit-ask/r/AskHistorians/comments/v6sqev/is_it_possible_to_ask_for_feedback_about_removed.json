No notification ever appeared and if I go to the comments in my profile I can still see it in the thread. About the answers itself: I&amp;#39;ve reread them and I understood why the majority of them were deleted but I still think that a couple of my submissions are in line with this sub rules&amp;#39;.\nI&amp;#39;m not pretending that I didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong but I would like to know which rules did I break  , in order not to repeat the same mistake in the future. \nMy question is : is there a way to improve this situation? I understand that mods cannot justify every single action but is there a way to at least notify people when their comments are deleted? And is it acceptable to message the mods and ask why your answer was rejected?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
