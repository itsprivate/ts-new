According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.thechristianleftblog.org/blog-home/the-bible-tells-us-when-a-fetus-becomes-a-living-being?fbclid=IwAR1Uwof9d-xJ-2uybDcQRlSMac-xqDVpAacTY2tk9GgvU7YOGqt9ZyrIZLY\"&gt;this article,&lt;/a&gt; the bible only mentions a human soul entering their body when the child draws its first breath, which would suggest that babies weren&amp;#39;t even fully considered human until they were born. It also mentions verses where a woman is explicitly given an abortion remedy, which is framed as a good thing. As well, &lt;a href=\"https://origins.osu.edu/history-news/abortion-history-and-beginning-life?language_content_entity=en\"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; talks about how Christians in medieval times had complex and fluid views on abortion, but never considered it to be murder, exactly, with some venerated saints even having supposedly performed miraculous abortions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware that until a few decades ago, the question of abortion was called the &amp;quot;Catholic problem,&amp;quot; as protestants didn&amp;#39;t really have firm views on it even then, but my question, I guess, is when did even the Catholics start preaching against abortion, and when did they propose the idea of life beginning at conception, and with what evidence and/or reason?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
