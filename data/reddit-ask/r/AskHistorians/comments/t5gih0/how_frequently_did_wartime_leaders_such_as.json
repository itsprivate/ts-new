Who covered for them in that time? Or did they really work 7 days per week for the entire war? If so, how did they cope? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Answers don`t have to be limited to just World War II and I would be happy to read answers about leaders in other conflicts. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
