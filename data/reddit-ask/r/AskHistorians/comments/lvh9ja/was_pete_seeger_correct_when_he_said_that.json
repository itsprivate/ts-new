If I am recalling correctly he gave examples such as singing on family car rides, drinking songs, and religious events. I guess one could add camp songs to that as well. While obviously singing in church remains a vibrant affair in some traditions, in many others it is not (at my own church growing up hymns were strictly perfunctory). And I can&#39;t remember any bar I ever went to having an atmosphere welcoming to big drunken singing group, including probably one of the few honest-to-God community pubs that exists west of the Mississippi.</p>\n\n<p>Is Pete Seeger correct in his estimation that Americans used to sing together much more than they do today?
