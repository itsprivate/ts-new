Suddenly, the National Convention announces that Robespierre is, himself, a traitor, he&amp;#39;s arrested and guillotined, and his policy of terror is outlawed. It seemed like he had their full support until he gave his speech on 8 Thermidor. What am I missing? What actually happened to make Robespierre fall so suddenly and dramatically? Was it really because of one speech, or was there something else happening behind the scenes?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
