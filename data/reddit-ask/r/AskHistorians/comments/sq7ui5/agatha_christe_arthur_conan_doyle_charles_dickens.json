How common was this? I know anti-Asian sentiment was common, often portraying Asians as exotic and inscrutable, sometimes with otherworldly intuition or as clever criminals. Were these stories perpetuating those stereotypes, or was there something to the opium den phenomenon, or both? Finally, what are some good sources on understanding anti-Asian bias in fiction, especially golden age detective fiction?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
