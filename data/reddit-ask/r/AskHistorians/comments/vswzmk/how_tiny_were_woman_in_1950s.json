I work out and eat healthy and what prevented me from fitting in these dresses was my ribs! Did woman just have smaller waists and ribs in proportion to their bodies back then? Or am I actually considered plus size in 1950s fashion? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To clarify: I am asking due to curiosity not because I feel the need to fit these dresses or lose weight. I just was shocked haha!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
