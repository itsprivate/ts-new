Usually it’s part of a list of flawed or outdated ideas and there isn’t a specific explanation of what the flaws are. Could someone provide an explanation of why this is a flawed way of looking at things?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, would it be better to teach the same stuff then do a little critical thinking exercise looking at the potential flaws, or should I throw it out entirely and use a different framework. Remember this all has to be squeezed into about three 45 minute periods!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
