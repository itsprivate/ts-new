Augustine spends a lot of time (Ch. 16-28) in the first book arguing that women who were raped during the Fall of Rome should not commit suicide. It feels like an excessive amount of argument for an obvious point. But when something in a classic seems obvious, maybe we should read the history of philosophy backwards and try to figure out what society was like that made it necessary to argue this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did Augustine invent rape?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The act of rape clearly predates Augustine. I&amp;#39;m referring to the idea of rape, as something morally distinct from adultery. The way we understand rape is: If someone does not consent, then rape does not impact their virtue. They are blameless, just as virtuous as they were before, and should not be punished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one of the several supporting arguments, Augustine cites some Roman poets talking about the rape of Lucretia: &amp;quot;There were two, but the adultery was only committed by one.&amp;quot; Lucretia then committed suicide because of her shame. This is part of the idea of rape: she is considered blameless. But I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the entire idea: her virtue/honor is tainted by the rape and the poets celebrate her suicide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was Augustine the first person to articulate our understanding of rape?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[I also asked this in &lt;a href=\"/r/askphilosophy\"&gt;r/askphilosophy&lt;/a&gt; and they suggested I post it here.]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
