Even as a youngster, while an interesting read, it seemed like there was a fair bit of speculation going and opinionated, rather than really being a academic work informed by the latest research. After reading it and looking for input on the book, it seemed the academic consensus was the book clearly had some inaccuracies, and should not be considered &amp;quot;very scholarly&amp;quot; even at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am curious if the folks here at AskHistorians would have any recommend books for interested, but causal, readers for a archeological, anthropological, and sociological informed walk-through of the bible as a historical text. This is something that has been on my list to revisit for a while, but being honest, not something I am looking to dive into with a dense academic text (at least currently).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this isn&amp;#39;t so much a direct question on history, but rather a question about recommended references or sources and potentially a bit off-topic for the subreddit, but any suggestions, input, or general thoughts on any of the above would be greatly appreciated! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: What pop-history book would you recommend as an update to Issac Asimov&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Guide to the Bible&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers,\nRabbits&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: If this is too far off-topic for this subreddit and there is a better place to ask such questions, please just let me know!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
