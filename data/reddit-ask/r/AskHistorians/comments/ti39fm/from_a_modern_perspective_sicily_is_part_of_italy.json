Now Sicily is the biggest island in the Mediterranean and as the crossroads of a bunch of cultural zones. Byzantines, Arabs, Berbers, Normans, Germans (HRE), even the French all ruled for decently long periods on the island, some leaving deeper marks than others. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did the Normans, from my understanding just a small ruling class, consider the island to be? it was Muslim Arabic before them, but Greek even before that. And what did the wider world consider the Norman Kingdom to be? was it considered Latin-Christian despite the obvious adoption of Arab and greek cultural practices? Did they differentiate the culture of the rulers and the place of the island itself? were there different narratives for where the normans and the island belonged to between the different peoples? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;sorry for stacking so many questions on other questions, there is just so much to ask about this topic&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
