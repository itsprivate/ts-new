Buried pirate gold, El Dorado and others have all been searched for by many different people. Of course plenty of historical artefacts have been found before, but nearly all of these seem to have been found by chance, by accident or by excavation of already known locations. My question is, has there ever been a successful treasure hunt? A treasure hunt of the stereotypical/cliché kind, where the exact location of the treasure is unknown and people have to search for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
