In my homeland roman-era structures have withstood earthquakes and volcano eruptions and 2000 years of wars and history. Whilst in Bergen, the rainiest city in Europe so not the most flammable I assume, there has been an average of a fire every 20 years that burnt the city to the ground, the last big one in 1955. Similar stories are found in many norwegian cities I have been to and traces of their past have been entirely destroyed by fires, but in the little I have seen of swedish and danish cities this is not always the case, I&amp;#39;ve seen castles and housing from at least the renaissance. Instead in Norway, cities that would be as old as many french, british and german cities look modern-ish because of the choice of materials their past erased entirely. I thought it could be poverty, but Bergen was a center of trade and a fairly large city for the time I seem to understand, it was even the capital at some point and they say even then that the main stone structure (Haakon&amp;#39;s Hallen) was built on initiative of a danish princess. Guides say that working with stones was expensive, but most of these cities are close to mountains, I&amp;#39;m no geologist but rocks don&amp;#39;t appear to be scarce. What crucial resource was missing?  Or is it just a matter of preference? Because I imagine that having a whole city burn down to be quite a hassle, especially 2-3 times in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
