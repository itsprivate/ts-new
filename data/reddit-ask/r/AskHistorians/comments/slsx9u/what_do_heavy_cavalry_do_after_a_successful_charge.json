Shouldn&amp;#39;t targeting and dropping the horses in the front of the horse successfully dissipate the onslaught (the horse behind would topple over the horses at front, thus creating a domino effect)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
