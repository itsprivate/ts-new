He says that “The Anglo-Saxon lecturer was candid about his subject: it was, he said, a language of purely linguistic interest, and hardly a line of Anglo-Saxon poetry extant possessed the slightest literary merit. I disagreed. I thought of Beowulf lying wrapped in a blanket among his platoon of drunken thanes in the Gothland billet; Judith going for a &lt;em&gt;promenade&lt;/em&gt; to Holofernes’s stuff-tent; and &lt;em&gt;Brunanburgh&lt;/em&gt; with its bayonet-and-cosh fighting-all this came far closer to most of us that the drawing-room and deer-park atmosphere of the eighteenth century.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize this is before Tolkien started teaching at Oxford, and before he started pointing out the value of early works like &lt;em&gt;Beowulf.&lt;/em&gt; My question is: What was the pre-Tolkien view of poetry that Graves (and the young Tolkien) would have been taught? What was “literary merit” at this point, and why did Anglo-Saxon poetry not have it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
