Abortions were not completely safe procedures and I imagine raising the child might be costly in both resource and opportunity cost for someone in this line of work. So my questions are: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- What kind of methods did women in this line of work use to avoid being constantly pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- How often would one of these workers get pregnant?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- How was that child dealt with if born?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagine many cultures in many different times had enough different practices to fill a room, so Im more interested in the context of Western Europe in the middle ages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
