But I would think the warm climate and coastal parts of Africa, as well as their own islands, would make for some good resort areas. Yet you rarely see people take trips or honeymoons to these West African countries with the frequency of which trips are taken to the Caribbean. Is it mainly a proximity thing or due to the “reputation”?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
