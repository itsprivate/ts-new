I don’t think I’ve actually heard this in any comedy though, where does the concept of a short drum sequence in association with a joke come from? Were there many formats of it, and if so why is the ba dum tsss sequence the “joke” drum instead of some other drum phrase? Was this common enough in some timeframe that it’s now part of the conception of a joke? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, is there any tradition of similar kinds of musical accompaniment to spoken comedy (filling the same sort of niches as the joke drum sting, wah-wah trumpets, etc, not really comedic lyrical songs) before contemporary history?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
