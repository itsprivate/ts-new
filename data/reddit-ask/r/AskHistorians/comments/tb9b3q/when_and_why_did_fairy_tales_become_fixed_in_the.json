Were they originally told in the Middle Ages with contemporary imagery, and then the stories just stayed the same while the world around them developed? Or was there a point in the 18th and 19th centuries where people decided that stories set in the medieval era were better than stories set in their &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; eras?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
