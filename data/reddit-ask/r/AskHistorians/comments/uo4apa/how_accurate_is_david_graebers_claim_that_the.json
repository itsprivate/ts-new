In the book, they make an interesting claim: that the European Enlightenment was, in many ways, started by Native American philosophers criticizing European customs. They bring up the example of Kondiaronk, a Native Chief, who conducted a series of interviews in which he laid out his view on white customs and society. This apparently was widely read in Europe and inspired people like Rousseau. He also brings up several passages written by European missionaries, in which Natives bring up points that seem eerily reminiscent of later Enlightenment thinkers.  This is an interesting take on the Enlightenment. How much weight does it hold? Also, could you recommend any further reading on this subject?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
