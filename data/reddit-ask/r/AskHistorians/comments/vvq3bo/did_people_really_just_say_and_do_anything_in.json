The servants may have their own dramas but what they don&amp;#39;t do is go across the street to Mrs. Fancy&amp;#39;s house to tell their friends who work for Mrs. Fancy that Mrs. Snooty called Mrs. Fancy a ho and said her dress looked cheap and oh yeah Mr. Snooty pees in the parlour palm when he comes home drunk and he has a big gambling debt and a sidepiece and he and Mrs. Snooty have been fighting about it. Or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I get that if you got caught gossiping about your employer you&amp;#39;d get fired and not have a reference which could easily lead to a life of desperate poverty, but wouldn&amp;#39;t Mrs. Snooty still have some reservations about  the risk? Or just be embarrassed to be crying about Mr. Snooty&amp;#39;s sidepiece in front of the butler? Did employers just see servants as ambulatory furniture while simultaneously servants had some insane sense of loyalty to their employers? Because that sounds crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any historical examples of servants causing trouble (or even preventing trouble) by not keeping their employer&amp;#39;s secrets?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
