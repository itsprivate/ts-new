But he swears it was France and that the crowd was swearing in French etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is, did this really happen?  And if so, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; were the French civilians angry at the Americans?  AND, if it &lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; French civilians, then who was it? And why were &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; throwing rotten vegetables at a train full of American soldiers?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
