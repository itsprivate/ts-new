I’ve heard it all Nikephoros, Tzimisces, belisarius, Basil etc.</p>\n\n<p>I want to know what Constantinople was like in detail, I want to know what the everyday people of the Muslim world, the nobles even the caliphs themselves thought of Byzantium, it’s culture, it’s cities and structures, it’s legacy and most of all its military, especially during the 850-1050 era,  were there superstitions the common people of the caliphate had about the Byzantines? What did Muslim soldiers think before fighting them or what did they say it was like fighting them? Did the Caliphs/Emirs to some extent their might as the only nation to majorly ground their unstoppable conquests to a halt?? </p>\n\n<p>Anyone who could answer these questions and/or guide me to sources to learn more myself would be great</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
