Winters is &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/joT50wd7TrA\"&gt;being interviewed&lt;/a&gt; by Maj. Gen. Chapman of the 13th Airborne Div. for a potential transfer to the Pacific. While recalling his experiences, Winters mentions that he never fired his weapon again after being promoted to battalion XO. The conversation goes like this (~ 1:30 in the linked video):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;W: &amp;quot;I fired my last shots there [Holland].&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C (amazed): &amp;quot;For the whole damn war?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;W: &amp;quot;Yes, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: &amp;quot;You got through Bastogne without having to fire your weapon?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;W: &amp;quot;That is correct, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: &amp;quot;And you were on the line the whole time?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;W: &amp;quot;Yes, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: &amp;quot;Can&amp;#39;t imagine a tougher test for a leader. Having to sit through a siege like that -- under those conditions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;W: &amp;quot;We got through it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The general&amp;#39;s reaction has always intrigued me. Was he amazed because of its sheer improbability? Or, as the dialogue suggests, there was a belief that someone of Winters&amp;#39;s rank not firing his weapon indicated a higher degree of discipline or skill?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
