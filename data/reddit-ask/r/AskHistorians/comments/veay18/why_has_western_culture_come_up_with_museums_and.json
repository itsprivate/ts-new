I’m just puzzled by how in the 19th century, for example, European egyptologists “discovered” all sorts of ancient remains and artefacts that had actually been lying there all along. People were partially aware of them but they did not seem to have the same attitude of Europeans. So what does this attitude consist of? Where does it stem from?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example is the colosseum, whose stones have been used for centuries as building material. The arena itself was inhabited by different people. So why has the colosseum been considered for centuries as nothing more special than any other abandoned monument? What changed then?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
