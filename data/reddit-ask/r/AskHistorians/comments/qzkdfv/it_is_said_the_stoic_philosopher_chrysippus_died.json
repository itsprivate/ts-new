  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Chrysippus was a stoic philosopher known for his good humour. Here&#39;s how Wikipedia has his death:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He died during the 143rd <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad\">Olympiad</a> (208–204 BC) at the age of 73.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus#cite_note-dorandi1-4\">[4]</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_La%C3%ABrtius\">Diogenes Laërtius</a> gives two different accounts of his death.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus#cite_note-laertius185-18\">[18]</a> In the first account, Chrysippus was seized with dizziness having drunk undiluted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece_and_wine\">wine</a> at a feast, and died soon after. In the second account, he was watching a donkey eat some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_fig\">figs</a> and cried out: &quot;Now give the donkey a drink of pure wine to wash down the figs&quot;, whereupon he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_from_laughter\">died in a fit of laughter</a>. His nephew <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocreon\">Aristocreon</a> erected a statue in his honour in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerameikos\">Kerameikos</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus#cite_note-19\">[19]</a> Chrysippus was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by his pupil <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Tarsus\">Zeno of Tarsus</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, I suppose Diogenes Laertius would think either the image, or the joke Chrysippus made, was at least a little funny. Why? Is it because eating figs and drinking is a human activity? Is it because the donkey was already associated with human stupidity (and Chrysippis laughter has anything to do with observing human folly)? Is it related with the undiluted wine? What&#39;s the deal with donkey food?</p>\n\n<p>PS: I hope I could add a non-specific question as an extra. Chrysippus was known for being funny, but no works of him have lasted. Are there mentions of Chrysippus&#39; arguments or shenanigans which are humourous?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
