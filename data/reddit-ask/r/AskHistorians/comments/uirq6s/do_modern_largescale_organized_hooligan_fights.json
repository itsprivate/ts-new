  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve all seen film depictions of medieval or ancient battles where everyone gets chaotically intermingled after the first charge and start fighting with absolutely no cohesion, much less a battle line. It never makes much sense, except maybe to show how heroically badass the main character is. But what do historians say these battles *really* looked like and how do they come to those conclusions? Obviously contemporary accounts written after battles exist but these are pretty limited for a lot of reasons so it seemed worth wondering what other ways we could get insight into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how many of you are aware of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-FJWFH-QdQ&amp;amp;list=PL1666786A54648A90&amp;amp;index=93\"&gt;youtube subgenre of hool fights&lt;/a&gt; but they were fairly popular some 10-15 years ago during the heyday of the European &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hooligan_firms\"&gt;hooligan firms&lt;/a&gt; and hooliganism in general. Basically hooligan firms are organized groups of young, typically male, supporters of a particular football/soccer club who routinely get in fights with the firms of rival teams. These fights are often pretty well planned with the firms pre-coordinating on the number of participants on each side, location, colors worn, even rules to an extent such as allowing downed individuals to tap out to exit the fight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway... some of these larger fights (around a 50 vs 50 person count and above) kind of seem like they play out a lot like battles fought centuries ago. The fighters on both sides keep pretty tight with their comrades, a major goal is to avoid having someone run up and hit you from behind, there&amp;#39;s even a clear &amp;quot;line of battle&amp;quot;. Sure there are no deadly weapons, missiles, etc. but there&amp;#39;s still lots of stuff you might expect if you transported yourself back to watch two semi-organized societies go at it back in the day. You even see how battles were won, with one side gradually giving ground until the participants decide they&amp;#39;ve had enough and make a run for it. Pretty interesting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so all of that&amp;#39;s just a long winded way of asking if serious historians ever study these types of fights to get a clearer understanding of what battles were like and how they were fought. Thanks for reading and please enjoy a few more videos that I think are good representatives of these types of fights. And if anyone has a link to one particular fight where the blue shirted side absolutely crushes and rolls up the flank of the orange shirted side then I&amp;#39;ll give you some god damn reddit gold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the most famous video, it&amp;#39;s found under many (often incorrect) title descriptions around the web: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqIAWcTLKx8&amp;amp;list=PL1666786A54648A90&amp;amp;index=35&amp;amp;t=26s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqIAWcTLKx8&amp;amp;list=PL1666786A54648A90&amp;amp;index=35&amp;amp;t=26s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one isn&amp;#39;t as organized but DOES show the pulse effect: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWzc1R6pRE&amp;amp;list=PL1666786A54648A90&amp;amp;index=40\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWzc1R6pRE&amp;amp;list=PL1666786A54648A90&amp;amp;index=40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A smaller scale example, maybe 25 vs 25, but many of the same principles are shown: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItKm6EdZaWU&amp;amp;list=PL1666786A54648A90&amp;amp;index=24\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItKm6EdZaWU&amp;amp;list=PL1666786A54648A90&amp;amp;index=24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
