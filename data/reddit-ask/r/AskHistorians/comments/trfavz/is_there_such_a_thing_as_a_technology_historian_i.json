I understand the basic principle of “device driver” software components, but it’s just boggling my mind how it was possible for software to run with acceptable and even sometimes impressive performance with things like coprocessors and expansion boards before the invention of modern “threading” tech - or was that concept actually in place all along and just not discussed in the same terms?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like this may be more of a “tech” question than a classic “history” question in the spirit of this subreddit, though, so I would be happy if someone could just point me to the right place to ask this question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
