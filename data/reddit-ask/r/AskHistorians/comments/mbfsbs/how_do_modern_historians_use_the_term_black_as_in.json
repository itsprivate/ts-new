Even in modern times, the term means different things in different places – a person who&#39;s considered black in the US may instead be identified as mixed in Brazil or Arab in Sudan. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the term &quot;black&quot; seems to be designed for an American context (perhaps due to the one-drop rule). After all, a person from Ethiopia doesn&#39;t have much in common with a Nigerian when it comes to culture, language, and customs. It doesn&#39;t make sense to group them, yet most people, at least outside of Africa, would still consider both people as black. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen other terms used instead: Sub-Saharan Africa(ns) for example. But that seems to play into the old stereotype of &quot;merging&quot; North Africa more together with Europe and/or Asia and downplaying its connections with the rest of the continent. </p>\n\n<p>I feel like whatever term you use is inherently flawed. Let&#39;s say I would like to study the history of black people (both on the African continent and in the international diaspora): is there a way to accurately describe this? Is it more &quot;correct&quot; to say &quot;I would like to study the history of black people&quot; or are you better suited to say &quot;I would like to study the history of sub-Saharan Africa and its diaspora&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>The more I think about it the more confused I get.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
