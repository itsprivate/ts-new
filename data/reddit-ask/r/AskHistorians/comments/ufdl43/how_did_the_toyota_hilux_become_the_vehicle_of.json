Did they run an ad campaign for guerrilla warfare? Why don&amp;#39;t we see Nissans or Fords or other makes in these same environments? Was the Toyota Hilux the only game in town? Or did the Toyota reputation for reliability help shoot it to the top of the technical game?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
