Did they have to take exams? What facilities did a university provide their students with? What were job prospects like after graduation? What did the students do outside of learning?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you have any interesting literature regarding the topic that gives a good overview you can recommend them to me too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
