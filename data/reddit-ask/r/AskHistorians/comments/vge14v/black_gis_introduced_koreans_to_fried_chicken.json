Kristen Kish said something about how Korea has the best fried chicken in the world and Alton Brown made the comment that it is because African American GIs taught Koreans how to make fried chicken during the Korean War.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was curious about this so I attempted my own research and found nothing to really corroborate what Alton Brown was saying. It seems like this is perhaps just an apocryphal story, but I am curious as to where it came from or why Alton Brown said it with such authority. I&amp;#39;m not specifically trying debunk this, but I am curious about a historians perspective on the likeliness of this exchange taking place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
