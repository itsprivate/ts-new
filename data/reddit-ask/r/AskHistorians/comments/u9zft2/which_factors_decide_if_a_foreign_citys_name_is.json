Sometimes that is not needed as the translated name is the same or almost the same as the dutch name. An example is Amsterdam. Or the name can&amp;#39;t be translated as the name doesn&amp;#39;t have a known meaning such as Groningen. \nThere are however a few cities with names that could be translated but aren&amp;#39;t. An example of this is the city named Den Bosch which can be translated into The Forest but almost never is. \nSo my question is: Why are some city names translated when spoken about in English and others not?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
