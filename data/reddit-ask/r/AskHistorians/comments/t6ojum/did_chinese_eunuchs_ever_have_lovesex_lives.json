I know there are lots of stories about them being corrupt or bad, but I&amp;#39;m also curious about the more human side of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I was going to lose my penis and testicles, I know that how it would affect my love life would be one of the first things on my mind. The thing is I know sexuality is very malleable and I figure losing those parts wouldn&amp;#39;t mean you would completely lose your sense of desire and pleasure, especially knowing there are other erogenous zones on the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course that is just the sexual side of things, there is also the romantic and emotional aspect of love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So did eunuchs take lovers? Did they ever write romantic poems or anything like that? Did they express any of those feelings, or was there an expectation that emasculation meant a total loss of those things? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a bunch, have a nice day everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
