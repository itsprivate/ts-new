All other rules also apply—no bigotry, current events, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For this round, let’s look at:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Disability&lt;/strong&gt;! Not only is there no one definition of what it means to have a disability, what&amp;#39;s a disability in one community, may not be in a different one. This week is about the complexities of what it means to have a disability (or people who are perceived as having, or self-identify as having, a disability) at all points in time and all places around the world. (Note: we do ask that if you&amp;#39;re going to describe a historical figure using modern language of disability or diagnose someone with a specific illness, we ask that you&amp;#39;re considerate with your language and that you consider the impact on readers.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
