With detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can guess some of these - the pissers, the suckers, the (bodice) rippers - but googling the others has led to difficulty.  &amp;quot;Fulders&amp;quot; mostly brings up surnames, for instance, while &amp;quot;Athanasians&amp;quot; gives me the Athanasian Creed.  And obviously adding &amp;quot;sex&amp;quot; to the end mostly gets me unrelated porn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, friends with more knowledge of the Restoration than I: Are these real terms from the time? And what kinds of kinks or fetishes do they imply?  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
