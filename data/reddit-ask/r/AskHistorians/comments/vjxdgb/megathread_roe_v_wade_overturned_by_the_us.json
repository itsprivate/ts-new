  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many of you are likely already well aware, this morning the Supreme Court of the United States released a decision overturning &lt;em&gt;Roe v Wade&lt;/em&gt;, the 1973 decision that recognized a constitutional right to abortion in the US. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AskHistorians is not a place to discuss current events, argue over modern politics, or post hot takes. There are plenty of other spaces to do that! We do, however, realize that this moment has a lot of history leading up to it, and will be a focus of a lot of questions and discussions on AskHistorians and elsewhere. Therefore, we are creating this megathread to serve as a hub for all of your &lt;strong&gt;historically-based&lt;/strong&gt; questions about abortion in America, Roe v Wade, historic attitudes towards abortion, the politics of reproductive rights, and other relevant topics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our rules still apply here, especially our rules about civility and the 20 Year Rule. We will remove comments that break these rules.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to learn more, we have a lot of answers already available on the subreddit, including&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous megathread on &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uhh2j1/megathread_abortion_in_america/\"&gt;Abortion in America&lt;/a&gt; with a detailed writeup by &lt;a href=\"/u/EdHIstory101\"&gt;u/EdHIstory101&lt;/a&gt; with some further follow-ups &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uk1p8d/a_recent_slate_article_claims_that_to_colonial/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8tr7p/were_coat_hangers_ever_really_used_for_athome/htlz42x/\"&gt;Were coat hanger ever really used for at-home abortions?&lt;/a&gt; also answered by &lt;a href=\"/u/EdHistory101\"&gt;u/EdHistory101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cuf2t3/why_did_american_evangelicals_reverse_their/\"&gt;Why did American Evangelicals reverse their position on abortion?&lt;/a&gt; with answers by &lt;a href=\"/u/sunagainstgold\"&gt;u/sunagainstgold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/u/key_lime_pie\"&gt;u/key_lime_pie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/phjax6/i_once_heard_us_republicans_chose_to_emphasize/hbkg56m/\"&gt;I once heard US Republicans chose to emphasize the abortion issue partly because judges who consistently ruled against civil rights also tended to rule against abortion rights. Is there a reliable source that connects these dots?&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/u/therewasamoocow\"&gt;u/therewasamoocow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/brdb9e/i_keep_hearing_prochoice_people_say_harsh/eoizi3n/\"&gt;I keep hearing Pro-choice People say harsh abortion laws will “take us back to the Dark ages”.
