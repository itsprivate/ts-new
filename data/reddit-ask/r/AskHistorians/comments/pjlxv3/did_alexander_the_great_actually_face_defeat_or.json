These battles took place in modern-day Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, respectively. They were all decisive victories for the Macedonians. And it was also my understanding that the diverse provinces of the Persian Empire acquiesced to Alexander rather quickly. By defeating Darius, Alexander was accepted as the inheritor of the empire. Of course, Alexander went beyond the borders of the Persian Empire and invaded India, but even there, he was only limited by his soldiers&#39; willingness to go further, and not material defeat. So did the ancient province of Bactria, which mostly corresponds to modern-day Afghanistan, actually give Alexander any defeats or troubles?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
