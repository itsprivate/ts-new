Evidence for this route is provided by the many hillforts that sprung up along the way as trading posts.

Amber, yes. Coral, not really. So who was sending coral all the way to Britain? Was this common? What kinds of coral artifacts were found in the hillforts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
