Qatar has a burgundyish color and Sri Lanka has a maroon bit but I’d argue that is more red than purple. Was it an unattractive color to people? It’s one of the three secondary (subtractive) colors and you see plenty of orange and green but no eggplant purple. The only country flag I can think of with significant purple is the flag of The Second Spanish Republic which is no longer used to my knowledge (except by Hispanophiles like me) . To be clear, I’m referring to a general color theme, not minor details of a flag such as a small section of a country seal present on a flag.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
