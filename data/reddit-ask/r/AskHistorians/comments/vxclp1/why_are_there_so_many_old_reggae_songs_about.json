Some examples below.  Were a bunch of trains recently built in Jamaica in the 50s and 60s?  I know a lot of old American folk music was about train hopping but not sure if there is a similar thread on the island.  At first glance it seems more spiritual than just a bunch of hobo stories. I can think of a lot of metaphors that fit the general aesthetic but figure there is some historical connection that will be better than speculation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/JnQTGNcNpI4\"&gt;Stop that Train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvF6zDAEDCs\"&gt;Skinhead Train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fJQ9DYL0k\"&gt;Train to Skaville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qHuKR0EqL4\"&gt;This Train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7hwTXTZxGU\"&gt;Hallelujah Train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
