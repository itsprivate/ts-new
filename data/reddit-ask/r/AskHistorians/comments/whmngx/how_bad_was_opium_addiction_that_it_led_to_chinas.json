So I&amp;#39;ve always been somewhat sceptical of the official (i.e. CCP-approved) version of the Opium Wars and how they led to China&amp;#39;s downfall. Considering everything that&amp;#39;s been written about opioid addiction from a modern, clinical perspective, it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine something as relatively mild as opium weakening China to such an extent that it led to mass narco-mania and the Century of Humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any reliable reports or data on how bad opium addiction was in 18th-early 20th century China, versus merely casual use (not everyone who takes opium will slip into a dysfunctional spiral)? How much of China&amp;#39;s problems can be directly pinned on corruption and foreign meddling, consequences of the opium &lt;em&gt;trade&lt;/em&gt;, versus the effects of opium itself? Could it be said the Opium Wars were really about other interests (i.e. the British wanted to get in China for trade/empire, the Chinese wouldn&amp;#39;t let them) but telling this horrible story of addiction was an easier way to rile up the masses?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
