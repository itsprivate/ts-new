It seems that it is making some kind of joke at the expense of the Germans in WWI. It looks old but I am not sure if it is actually from WWI or a reprint. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Google Translation of the Text: Debacle! Hindenburg: Me taking the offensive? Impossible...I&amp;#39;m nailed by ours and screwed by the Russians. Wilhelm: And me! I&amp;#39;m stuck in the Aisne, unscrewed in the Rhine and linked to the Katrepathes [Carpathians?]. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From some internet research, I am pretty sure this is a reference to the tense relationship between Paul von Hindenburg and Emperor Wilhelm II, and to various actions during WWI, such as the German invasion of Russia and a German offensive in the Carpathians. But correct me if I am wrong! Also it seems to be giving the general impression that both Hindenburg and Wilhelm are not succeeding in their war efforts. However, if anyone has additional context that can explain the specifics (and why French people might find this specific image and text funny), I would really appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
