The best I&amp;#39;ve been able to find is that there was some pretty vicious racism in Montana at the turn of the century, which drove out all the black residents, but I have difficulty believing that that was unique to Montana.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would anyone happen to know anything further about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
