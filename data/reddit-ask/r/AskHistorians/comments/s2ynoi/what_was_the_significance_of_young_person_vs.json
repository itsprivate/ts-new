Was it a class thing? That only higher class or respectable women were “ladies” (in the same way that higher class men were “gentlemen”) and that lower class or morally questionable women shouldn’t be addressed as such? If so, why person specifically? I feel like I should know this since I did my MA in Modern English Lit but I’ve never seen it explicitly addressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
