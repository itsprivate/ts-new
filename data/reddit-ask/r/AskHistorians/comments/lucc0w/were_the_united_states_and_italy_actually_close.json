After the 11 Italian-Americans were lynched relations between the U.S. and Italy got much worse, with the nations withdrawing their ambassadors. After Italian demands to arrest the lynchers were refused, some sources say that Italy even considered going to war with the U.S. This wasn&#39;t described in much detail, and the couple sources I found online mentioned that the President placated Italy by paying reparations and declaring a &quot;Columbus Day&quot; holiday in 1892, and the tensions eased.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially: Was war ever actually considered as an option to respond to the incident, or is it just exaggerated rumors? If it was actually considered, did each side actually have a war plan for a U.S.-Italian War, or would the two sides have just sat on opposite sides of the Atlantic until making peace?</p>\n\n<p>Sources making the claim of war fears or a &quot;war scare&quot;: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_14,_1891_New_Orleans_lynchings#Political_repercussions\">The Wikipedia article on the incident</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.peterlang.com/view/title/55205%5D(A%20summary%20of%20a%20book%20I%20cannot%20find%20online\">A summary of a book I cannot find online</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://law.jrank.org/pages/2694/New-Orleans-Mafia-Trial-1891-First-Best-Even-Most-Law-Abiding.html\">Another article</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
