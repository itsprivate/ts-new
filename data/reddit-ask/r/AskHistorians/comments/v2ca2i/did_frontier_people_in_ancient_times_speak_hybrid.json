The first thing I thought was: &amp;quot;is this historically accurate, did they talk like that?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m Spanish and in the very South where Spain and Morocco really intertwine, it&amp;#39;s not rare that both communities use words from both Spanish and Arabic, especially when they talk to one another. Also especially among the youngsters it&amp;#39;s like &amp;#39;cool&amp;#39; to use words from other languages, especially those that have like a &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; reputation to say so, therefore they mix in a lot of foreign words when they speak. I&amp;#39;ve heard that it&amp;#39;s very similar or even stronger in areas of the Southern border of the United States today, with Spanish and English.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to know if I this happened in border areas of the past, especially in those that were really mixed. I think of places like medieval Spain with all the Christian and Islamic kingdoms and the borders changing every now and then, or Holy Land during the Crusades, or Mexico during the Spanish conquest. I know that Spanish language is very influenced by Arabic and also we have lots of words from Nahuatl and other Native American languages, so I guess the Spaniards adopted lots of vocabulary from those languages. Maybe they used to talk in a hybrid way? Was it something cool or colloquial like it is today? Do we know anything at all? Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
