How did they make their foods flavorful. Are there any pre Colombian recipes for how exactly they used to prepare their food and what sorts of seasoning and herbs they used to make it taste good? Quite a few of them were sedentary and had taken up agriculture so surely they had elaborate ways of preparing foods&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
