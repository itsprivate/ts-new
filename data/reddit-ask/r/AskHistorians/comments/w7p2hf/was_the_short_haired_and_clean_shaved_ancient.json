The Germanic tribes are described by Romans as having long hair that they only cut when they lost a battle. The ancient Greeks, most of them seem to have had bushy beards (notable exception being Alexander the Great). Whereas Caesar, Octavian, Scipio, Marc Anthony, Trajan are all clean shaven and have short haircuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later on, Huns, Mongols, Turks have either long hair or those thin long mustaches. Even people Europeans met later, like Native Americans or Polinesians are also depicted as having long hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, were the Romans peculiar in this regard or is there a bias involved? Maybe only those images stuck in my head and there are other depictions I&amp;#39;m not thinking of. Maybe they didn&amp;#39;t wear their hair like that, but were depicted as such by Europeans because long hair = barbarian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, a sort of follow up question if my previous assumption is correct. Is this why nowadays a short haircut and a clean shave is considered &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; and long hair and beards are considered &amp;quot;unkempt&amp;quot;? Is this a vestige of Roman civilisation unconsciously transmitted to this day?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
