Did nobles live at court or did they have their own homes near by maybe? Were they there all day just chillin and walking the halls talking shit? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also why was gossiping allowed?! Is court not a castle? Is it not where the king and queen lived? Or did they live somewhere else? Because they just let people walk around their homes talking shit about them all day, gossiping? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also was court a public place or just for VIPs like nobles? Could common people go to court? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or do I have it all wrong? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also do courts exist today and when was the last one?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
