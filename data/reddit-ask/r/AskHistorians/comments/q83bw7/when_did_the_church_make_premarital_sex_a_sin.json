Both of Jacob&#39;s wives, Rachel and Leah, gave their respective female slaves to Jacob to have sex with in order to beget heirs (Genesis 30:1-13).  Judah once picked up a woman he presumed to be a prostitute, and then begat two of his sons through this fornication (Genesis 38:11-30).  Samson once had sex with a prostitute, and then immediately afterwards defeated his enemies through the power of God (Judges 16:1-3).  The Bible doesn&#39;t seem to have a big problem with premarital sex as a general rule.</p>\n\n<p>Nor does the Bible, as a rule, require people to remain a virgin until marriage.  Young women at the time were generally expected to be virgins before marriage, but this appears to only be customary within the context of a culture which practiced arranged marriages.  In this system, virgin brides were highly prized by potential grooms and fetched a premium bride-price for the woman&#39;s family.  The biblical inclination towards virgin brides appears to have only social and economic significance, yet it would seem that Christians have reappropriated the concept for a different purpose.  Instead of having social and monetary value, remaining chaste until marriage has been given religious and spiritual value.  Christians believe that God is pleased with those who keep their virginity and save sex for marriage, and that to do otherwise is a sin.  Also, even though it was really only the women who were expected to remain chaste for their husbands, and not the other way around, Christians now expect men to also remain virgins until marriage.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: when did this happen?  At what point in church history did they adopt the ideas that premarital sex was a sin and that remaining celibate until marriage was a virtue?  And <em>why</em> did the Church do this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
