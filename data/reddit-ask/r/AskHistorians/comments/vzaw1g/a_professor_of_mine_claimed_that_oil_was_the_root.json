However, Serbia did not wish for Austria-Hungary to gain even more influence over them and fought against the railroad being built. To suppress Serbia, Franz Ferdinand would be sent there (unbeknownst to him) and killed, sparking a &amp;quot;regional war&amp;quot; where Serbia would lose and the railroad could be built. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How factual is this claim? I always saw it as a complex web of nationalistic attitudes rather a resource grab. Am I wrong?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
