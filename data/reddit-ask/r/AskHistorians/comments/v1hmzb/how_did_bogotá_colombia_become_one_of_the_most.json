How did this land-locked city remain in contact with Spain? How did Bogota post-Columbian independence survive as the nation’s capitol, and why wasn’t a coastal city chosen instead [like other major South American cities, such as Caracas, Lima, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro (pre Brasília), etc.]?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
