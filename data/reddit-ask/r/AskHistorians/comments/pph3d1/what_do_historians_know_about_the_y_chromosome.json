Unfortunately, I don&#39;t completely understand the article.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, in many parts of the world, between 7000 and 5000 years ago, only one male in twenty (give or take) actually reproduced.</p>\n\n<p>Do historians have any evidence that helps us understand what really happened? As I imagine it, it seems like bands or armies of closely related males would invade and dominate a certain region, monopolize all the women, possibly in some harem-like system, and then enslave, castrate or kill the local males. The sons and grandsons of the dominant males would then go on to father subsequent generations of children.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m guessing the invaders couldn&#39;t kill all the non-dominant males because they would be needed for farming and herding, to produce enough food for the women, children and invading males. However, I&#39;m only guessing. Do historians have any evidence that sheds light on this?</p>\n\n<p>The article I cited above, explains why this system disappeared about 5000 years ago, but the explanation is hard to understand. Can historians clarify it?</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if the system disappeared entirely. Are more recent systems of severe restriction of female sexual freedom, harems, eunuchs, and male slaves or peasants, modern remnants of this ancient phenomenon?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
