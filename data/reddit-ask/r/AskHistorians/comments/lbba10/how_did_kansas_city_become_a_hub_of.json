Many great African-American musical innovators like Charlie Parker, Lester Young, Charlie Christian  and Count Basie made their reputations there.

But when I ask Black friends who live there today, they do not see it as a culturally Black city. What happened to make KC a center of Black culture then, and how did that decline?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
