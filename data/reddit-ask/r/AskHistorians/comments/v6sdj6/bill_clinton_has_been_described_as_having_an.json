  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw a Reddit comment last night that was a reply to someone saying their wife saw Bill Clinton on a commercial flight and the comment was joking &amp;quot;Be glad she didn&amp;#39;t leave you. I&amp;#39;ve been in his presence once, and I don&amp;#39;t have the words to describe it.&amp;quot; and it got me thinking: Clinton, Kennedy, and Reagan are seen as the big three charismatic presidents such as in &lt;a href=\"https://deadpresidents.tumblr.com/post/9338919263/other-than-lbj-and-nixon-are-there-any-other\"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; comparing their ability to communicate (the same blogger explains &lt;a href=\"https://deadpresidents.tumblr.com/post/25036568044/rebloggable-by-request-presidential-charisma-and\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; why he doesn&amp;#39;t include Obama) but unlike Clinton, Kennedy and Reagan died before Reddit/social media as we know it today existed. Did people say they had an indescribable pull, such as in letters or articles? What about even older charismatic presidents such as FDR?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
