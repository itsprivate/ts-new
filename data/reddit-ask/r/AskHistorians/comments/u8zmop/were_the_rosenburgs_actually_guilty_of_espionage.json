They were executed in a time of high paranoia in the USA, and the books somewhat leave the impression that their conviction and execution might have more a product of the hysteria as opposed to them being actual Soviet spies and seems to imply that their execution was a miscarriage of justice. So, how guilty were the Rosenburgs? Was their trial more of kangaroo court or was their conviction legally sound?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose my question comes in two parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the historical consensus of the investigation/trial as it took place. By the standards of the time period, where they found guilty in proper court of law with proper evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt? Did the state respect their legal rights as per the law in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the seventy or so years since their trial, how much more do we know to support or refute what those in the 1950s knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
