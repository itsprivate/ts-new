Homosexuality was slightly more acceptable than in previous decades. Women could work. Jazz and Petting Parties were all the rage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas  when you look at the Popular Culture of the 1950s, it seems as though  all of that progress had seemingly reversed. The nuclear family was the pinnacle of life. Women went back to dressing more modestly, were discouraged from working, and going to college. Homosexual behavior was  condemned and could get you institutionalized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While on the other hand, the 1950s saw the beginnings of the US Civil Rights movement with Rosa Parks, MLK Jr, and the backlash against racism in general after the horrific Emmet Till incident. Anti-Miscegenation Laws began to be overturned in some states as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, is this simply my overlooking more progressive aspects of the 50s, or is there some truth to my entirely subjective observation?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
