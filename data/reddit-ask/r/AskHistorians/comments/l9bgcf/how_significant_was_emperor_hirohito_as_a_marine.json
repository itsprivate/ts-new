However, it also implies that he did make scientifically important discoveries. (Source: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/oceansciencehistory.com/2015/08/15/emperor-hirohito-the-marine-biologist-who-ruled-japan/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/oceansciencehistory.com/2015/08/15/emperor-hirohito-the-marine-biologist-who-ruled-japan/amp/</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d therefore like to ask two questions:\n1. Did Emperor Hirohito ever publish any research or make any discoveries that were significant to the field of marine biology (or his speciality within it)?\n2. How widely known was his status as a marine biologist prior and during WW2, and how would that have contributed to the public&#39;s perception of him? (for both Japanese and non-Japanese audiences)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this, and have a good week!</p>\n\n<p>Note: sorry for poor formatting, am on mobile web version of Reddit!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
