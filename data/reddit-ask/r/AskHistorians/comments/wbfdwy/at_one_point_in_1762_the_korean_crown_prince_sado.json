The killing was recognized as a problem by other members of his household, but basically brushed off until it seemed that he threatened to kill the king himself.  Do we have any other contemporary sources that tell us how many people he killed total, and whether there were any repercussions for this?  Would it have been news in Korea that the prince is killing scores of people in the palace?  Were there any calls from the public or charges from the victim&amp;#39;s families, or was the royal family so powerful in Korean culture at that time that nobody could even talk about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
