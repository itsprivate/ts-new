So sorry for that in the first place haha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ottoman empire basically surrounded the city of Constantinople years before the conquest. Now I am asking myself on how they got their food supplies or did they do any trade with other external countries? Did they simply barricade themselves and didn&amp;#39;t open the gates of Constantinople for several years?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such a scenario is extremely unique in my opinion. One city in the center, being kept unconquered for several years while all north, east, west, south lands got conquered by the enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assume that back then it was not necessary to do any trade to survive?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
