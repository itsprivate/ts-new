  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously the most famous Onion Knight in popular culture today, especially in the west, is Ser Davos Seaworth from George R.R. Martin&amp;#39;s fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire, as well as its HBO adaption. That character, at least within the context of the story, got his name after being knighted for smuggling a boatload of onions into a castle under siege.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s interesting though is that this isn&amp;#39;t the first time the term onion knight showed up in pop culture. Eight years before Ser Davos first appeared in 1998&amp;#39;s A Clash of Kings, there was a job class called Onion Knight (&amp;quot;Tamanegi Kenshi&amp;quot; in Japanese, more or less a literal translation as far as I can tell) in the SquareSoft JRPG Final Fantasy III. Other Japanese fantasy games have them as well, most notably Dark Souls, but those may well be direct nods to Final Fantasy&amp;#39;s use of the term. I can&amp;#39;t see any such connection to Martin&amp;#39;s work though. I doubt he had played the game when he created Ser Davos, especially since Final Fantasy III was only officially released in the west in 2006, and even the first fully playable fan translation post-dates ACoK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now Onion Knight is a pretty weird term, so I was wondering whether the developers at SquareSoft and George R.R. Martin really came up with it independently, or whether they could both be referencing an earlier use of the term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
