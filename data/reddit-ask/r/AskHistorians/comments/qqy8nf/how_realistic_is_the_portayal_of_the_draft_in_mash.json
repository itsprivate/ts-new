I am wondering how realistic the portrayal of conscription during the Korean war is. In particular the length of time the conscripts would be expected to serve.</p>\n\n<p>Capt. &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce is a board certified thorasic surgeon. He is already at the 4077 MASH in the summer of 1950 and remains stationed there until the last day of the war, July 17, 1953. </p>\n\n<p>Cpl Klinger, a draftee Corpsman, is also there for the entire length of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Lt. Col Blake is the CO of the 4077 from summer of 1950 until probably late August 1952, when he has &quot;earned enough rotation points to go home&quot;. (He dies when his plane home is shot down). (Blake might be a reservist-- he talks a lot about being pulled away from his civilian practice but never says he is drafted. Can we assume he wasn&#39;t based on his rank?)</p>\n\n<p>In the first week of Sept 1952, Capt &quot;Trapper&quot; John MacInytre gets his discharge orders. They are evidentally a bit of a surprise-- Hawkeye left on a week&#39;s R&amp;R not knowing he would return to find his friend gone. Wouldn&#39;t his release from service have been scheduled months in advance?</p>\n\n<p>On Sept 12 1952 BJ Hunnicutt arrives in Korea. He has been drafted &quot;fresh out of surgical residency&quot; with a two-month old baby at home (would this not warrant a deferral?) . He remains at the 4077 until the last day of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Maj. Winchester is a thorasic surgeon who was drafted and  assigned to a hospital in Tokyo until he was transferred to the 4077 sometime in autumn 1952. He remains there until the end of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Cpl &quot;Radar&quot; O&#39;Reilly, a clerk, is also there at the beginning of the series. He is sent home in late 1952 on a &quot;hardship discharge&quot; after his uncle passes away, leaving his mother unable to manage the family farm alone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
