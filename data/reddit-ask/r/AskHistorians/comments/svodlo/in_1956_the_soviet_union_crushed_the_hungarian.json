Yet about 30,000 Soviet troops and KGB agents were able to suppress the revolt, inflicting massive casualties (over 3,000). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia was a Bloc-wide affair, with up to 500,000 total troops (250,000 of which came from the USSR), despite it being a &amp;quot;softer&amp;quot; situation: Czechoslovakia only wanted internal reforms rather than to fully depart the Bloc, revolutionaries didn&amp;#39;t overthrow the government, Czechoslovakian troops didn&amp;#39;t formally engage the invaders, and about 150 people died - 5% as few as the amount of casualties in Hungary in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did the Soviet Union manage to crush Hungary with so much fewer troops; or, conversely, why did they use such an overwhelming force on comparatively tiny Czechoslovakia in 1968? Was it a show of force, either to other Warsaw Pact members (unity against dissent) or to the Western powers against the backdrop of the Cold War and a potential conflict in Western Europe? Was it an attempt to use overwhelming force projection to stop a more active Hungary-style revolution before it started? Is the higher troop number causally linked with a lower number of casualties compared to Hungary due to the above deterrent effect?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
