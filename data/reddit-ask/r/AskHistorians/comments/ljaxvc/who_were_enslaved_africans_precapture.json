Were some part of larger West African society, in cities and such? What would often occur for these groups of Africans to end up captured and sold? Why would they have been conquered if they were tribal? Who would they have been really.</p>\n\n<p>I’d love to know anything about this part of history I feel isn’t really talked about much, or at least isn’t seen as important enough in comparison to what happened to their enslaved descendants, thanks to anyone who could help me understand 👍🏼</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
