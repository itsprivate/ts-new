West Point taught French and officers were encouraged to read and study French manuals and French history, and even apart from bayonet fencing, French fencing manuals were very common in American fencing culture, of which West Point was a part.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was this due to a connection that traced its way back to the Revolutionary War? Was it an ideological connection due to the French Revolution? Was it just that the U.S. Army looked up to French culture and organization, in the way that Peter I modelled his army on the Prussians? None of the above?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
