He was then sent to a Sibirian prison. (This prison has to be older than the Gulags from the Second World War) He spent 7 years there but because he learned to swim as a kid he somehow managed to flee this camp through a river nearby. It is said that it took him 3 days and 3 nights of swimming and diving to get out of sight from his persecutors. He then continued his way back via China, Buchara, India and Iran. His 3 year long journey ended when he reached the Ottoman Empire.  I&amp;#39;m wondering where he was imprisoned and wanted to ask if any of you might know of some camps &amp;quot;near&amp;quot; China with access to a river. We don&amp;#39;t know how long it took him to get to China but I guess he took the shortest route he found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this is the right subreddit to ask, I browsed through some other subs but found this suitable. Sorry if it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
