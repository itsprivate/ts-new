Movie theaters were closed and repurposed as mosques. Celebration of the Western and Iranian New Year was forbidden. Taking photographs and displaying pictures or portraits was forbidden, as it was considered by the Taliban as a form of idolatry. Women were banned from working, girls were forbidden to attend schools or universities, were requested to observe purdah and to be accompanied outside their households by male relatives; those who violated these restrictions were punished. Men were forbidden to shave their beards and required to let them grow and keep them long according to the Taliban&#39;s liking, and to wear turbans outside their households.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Banning everything from pet-ownership and sport to nearly every form of art and performance seems like it would make the life of an ordinary person immensely boring.</p>\n\n<p>How widely were these policies enforced? </p>\n\n<p>And if they were enforced, what did ordinary Afghans living under the Taliban do in their free time?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
