One of the lawyers for Roe was an SBC member. They passed pro-Choice resolutions in 1971, 1974 and 1976. How did the SBC become pro-Life?",

According to polls conducted by baptist organziations, most baptist pastors were in favor of allowin abortions in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 1970, a poll conducted by the Baptist Sunday School Board found that 70 percent of Southern Baptist pastors supported abortion to protect the mental or physical health of the mother, 64 percent supported abortion in cases of fetal deformity and 71 percent in cases of rape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three years later, a poll conducted by the Baptist Standard newsjournal found that 90 percent of Texas Baptists believed their state’s abortion laws were too restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 1971 resolution on abortions stated:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“We call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got this from the Baptist Press, which is the SBCs news service&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/how-southern-baptists-became-pro-life/\"&gt;https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/how-southern-baptists-became-pro-life/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is what happened to prompt thsi shift? The article linked explains it was a grassroots movememnt within the SBC that eventually led it in more pro-Life direction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can any historians comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
