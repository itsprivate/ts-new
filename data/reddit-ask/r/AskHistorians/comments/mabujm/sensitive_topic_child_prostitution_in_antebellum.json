Or does he mean he&#39;ll keep her until she&#39;s older then do it?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Obviously I know that sexual slavery was widespread in the South. And I know that the institution of slavery would allow someone to abuse children as they saw fit. But was prostituting pre-pubescent children something that happened (and something that a man like the trader would admit to) in the antebellum South with &quot;reasonable&quot; frequency?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
