This was obviously an effect of the revolutionary war, which was fought mostly by volunteer armies. It makes sense all those people kept using guns after the war, and that they taught their children to use guns&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However none of those old relatives owns a gun today, and neither does anyone else I know. To buy a gun you have to go to the one gun store in the country, which is owned by the army, and you have to pass all their tests which I&amp;#39;m told are quite strict, and even then they&amp;#39;ll only sell you a revolver or a hunting rifle&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly Mexico went through a very radical change in gun culture, but no one can tell me when it happened nor how&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked my grandparents when and why did people stop buying guns, or when did people start selling them, and they are not sure. I&amp;#39;ve asked them when did the law change to make gun ownership more regulated, but again they don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m baffled. How did Mexico change so much in regards to gun ownership?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
