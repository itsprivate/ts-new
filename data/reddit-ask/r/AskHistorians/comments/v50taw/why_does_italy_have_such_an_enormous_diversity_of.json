Italian pasta often has you buying &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; flour like 00. Even within pasta there are so many different kinds of dough that infuse different ingredients, use different kinds of flours, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it appears (also let me know if I&amp;#39;m just ignorant) that other cuisine that uses pasta has a comparably small amount of variety. Maybe long thin noodles and dumplings. Maybe a flour dough a rice base. But it seems like we&amp;#39;re comparing hundreds to a dozen or less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this?
