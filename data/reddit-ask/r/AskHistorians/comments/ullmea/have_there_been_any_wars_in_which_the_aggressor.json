There seem to be several wars such as the world wars in which, while hardly universal, there is nonetheless often considered to be ‘good guys’ and ‘bad guys’ by modern western media and perception. As far as I can think of though, it’s always been the country that invaded another country that is the ‘bad guy’ in these portrayals, and those that defend the invaded country the ‘good guys’ (Germany in the world wars would be an example, although it’s fair to say to was more than aggression that caused that portrayal in the second!). Likewise, it is the wars the west was involved in where they were the aggressors that seem to be the ones that have aged the worst in popular perception (although outside of the purview of the sub and subject to other factors, Iraq would probably be a good example). Are there any wars that break this trend - ie that the west is inclined to think the faction that invaded another was the ‘good guy’ in the exchange?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(The point of this question isn’t to determine who &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be the ‘good guys’ in the conflict, it is to give cases when they are already seen as such, regardless of the validity of that view)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
