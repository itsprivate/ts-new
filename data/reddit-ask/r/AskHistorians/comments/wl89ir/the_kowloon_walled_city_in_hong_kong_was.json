  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demolition of the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City\"&gt;Kowloon Walled City&lt;/a&gt; was decided at the beginning of 1987. By the middle of 1992, the city was (forcibly) deserted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Walled City, the world&amp;#39;s biggest slum at the time, was inhabited by more than 33.000 people. It formed its own, almost isolated community without any jurisdictional supervision (except for a few drug raids). The inhabitants were employed by illegal businesses: manufactures, restaurants, and healthcare services that would have been absolutely illegal anywhere else. Famously, a lot of dentists and doctors were operating there without a license - people who learned the know-how from their parents, mentors, or elsehow. Manufacturers that did not have to comply with any safety and hygiene regulations provided cheap supplies for restaurants, and fake counterfeits for shops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This documentary shows a very good glimpse of the businesses there: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=S-rj8m7Ssow\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=S-rj8m7Ssow&lt;/a&gt;. It is evident that these businesses could not function anywhere with jurisdiction in such conditions. It is also implied that many of the inhabitants were outlaws, people who for whatever reason could not legally be in Hong Kong, were under warrant, or even born outside of the system and having no legal identity whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is as follows: when the city was decided to be demolished, all these people had to relocate. This included all the illegal businesses. All the obviously very poor 33.000 inhabitants, who surely couldn&amp;#39;t afford to buy a flat elsewhere. And these people were employed by the illegal businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened to these businesses? What did their owners do once they were evicted? Surely, the unlicensed dentists could not operate outside the Walled City, and most business owners didn&amp;#39;t have finds to set up a legal shop. How did they earn a living afterward?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what about their employees? This eviction must have caused a surge of close to 33.000 unemployed people. People who have been employed by these illegal businesses, and most probably did not have any legal permit for the job they were doing. Especially the unlicensed dentists and doctors: how were they able to earn a living afterwards? Were there any official support from the government targeted to people who lacked licenses for their jobs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what about the situation with the outlaws? People who were illegally in Hong Kong, were wanted, or did not even exist in the eyes of the government? were they granted a kind of blanket amnesty and/or citizenship?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; How did Hong Kong deal with the 33.000 very poor homeless and jobless people in a mere 5 years without causing a humanitarian catastrophe? Where did the illegal businesses go, including their equipment? Were there any government support related to this? How was the situation of illegalness and unemployedness handled? What happened to the outlaw people there?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
