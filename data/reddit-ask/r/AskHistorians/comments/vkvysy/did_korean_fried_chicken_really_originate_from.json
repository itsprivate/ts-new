The story goes that the troops showed Koreans fried chicken and Koreans fell in love with it and started doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I cant find any primary sources to cite and every article I see written cites another article rather than a primary source or a secondary source from a historian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it very hard to believe that the concept of frying a chicken in Korea was invented in the 20th century when a chicken has been around since 2000BC. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wiki (Yes, i know its unreliable) says that Koreans have been frying chicken since the 15th century and mentions nothing about US troops introducing fried chicken during the Korean war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help????&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
