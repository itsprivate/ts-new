Yet for those of us involved in helping run AskHistorians, the moment seemed opportune to make the case for the advantages of digital platforms. The whole project, after all, is predicated on the notion that high-quality history has an audience beyond academia. As such, we set out to organise a conference that broke the mould, not just in terms of format, but also in terms of who gets to attend and participate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the generous support of you all, we’ve since hosted &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qcod0w/megathread_day_three_final_day_of_the/\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iugiah/megathread_its_the_final_day_of_the_askhistorians/\"&gt;digital&lt;/a&gt; conferences, and you can still &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/AskHistoriansPod\"&gt;watch the talks&lt;/a&gt; and read the AMAs from the amazing scholars who joined us. But we also wanted to share our intentions and lessons with other historians, and help shape what history conferences will look like in a post-pandemic world. As such, in late 2020, three of us (myself, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Historiagrephour\"&gt;u/Historiagrephour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Soviet_Ghosts\"&gt;u/Soviet_Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;) pitched an article to a special issue of &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt; on digital public history. Over the course of 2021, we received peer reviews, made revisions, and waited. And, at last, our article ‘Out of the Ivory Tower, into the Digital World? Democratising Scholarly Exchange’ has now been published and is available here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-229X.13259\"&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-229X.13259&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to an agreement with my own employer, the University of Sheffield, the article is completely open access, and can be viewed for free in perpetuity. We are very grateful for this, as breaking down barriers to knowledge was such an important part of our motivation to begin with, and we’re very excited that everyone here will be able to read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re all immensely proud to have been part of the AskHistorians Digital Conferences, and to be able to represent this community in a journal such as &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt;. We hope you enjoy the read!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
