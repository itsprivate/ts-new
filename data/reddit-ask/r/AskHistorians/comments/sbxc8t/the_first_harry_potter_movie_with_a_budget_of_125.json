To be clear, I&amp;#39;m not looking for a literary analysis (I&amp;#39;m sure the content helped, but great books get missed all the time).

Did some media giant pick up the series early and decide &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re going to market the hell out of this&amp;quot;? Was there a lull in children&amp;#39;s fiction at the time that led to a huge demand? Did the english-speaking world just decide that 1997 was the year to read to their kids a lot more than they used to?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
