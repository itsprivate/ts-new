Initially, all I came across was praise - looking into him, he apparently is an author and a professor of history. But today, I was on twitter and, in the comments responding to his inclusion into the Royal Historical Society - there were several people who were dismayed. I couldn’t find any specific critiques, but I assume the reason would be that his work isn’t considered strictly accurate. Is this the case? Is there any other reason that Felton would earn this contingent of detractors?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
