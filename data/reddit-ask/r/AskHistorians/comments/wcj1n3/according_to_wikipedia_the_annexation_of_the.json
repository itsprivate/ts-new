Even most of Israel&amp;#39;s allies do not recognise the annexation of the Golan Heights, with only 1 country other than Israel recognising it (namely the USA).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If international law refuses to acknowledge land gained by either defensive or offensive wars, where is the cut-off date for this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does this mean that Russia/USSR annexing Kaliningrad after World War II (a defensive war for them) is also considered illegal? Why/why not?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does this mean that the PRC annexing Tibet in 1951 (an offensive war for them) is also considered illegal? Why/why not?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does this mean that India annexing Goa in 1961 (an offensive war for them) is also considered illegal? Why/why not?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Before anyone says &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;the world recognises Russian, Chinese and Indian conquests because they have nukes&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Israel has nukes too&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As an Australian citizen, while our nation exists on Indigenous land, our nation&amp;#39;s existence is recognised worldwide despite our lack of nukes. Does our record of injustice against Indigenous people jeopardise our continued international recognition?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Turkey&amp;#39;s annexation of Northern Cyprus in 1974 is recognised by Turkey and no other nations. Does this mean that the cut-off date for the legality of land annexation is somewhere between 1961 and 1974?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
