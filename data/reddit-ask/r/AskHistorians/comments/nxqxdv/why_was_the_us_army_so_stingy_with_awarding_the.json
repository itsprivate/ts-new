After Washington, the highest army position (Commanding General/Chief of Staff) was held by Brigadier, Major, and Lieutenant generals until Grant, who was only promoted after the Civil War. The two successors to Grant were also four-star generals but then the Army went back to being headed by Major and Lieutenant Generals until WW1. Even during WW1 era, Chiefs of Staff Tasker Bliss and Peyton March were only temporarily made a full Generals and reverted back to Major Generals at the end of their appointments as Chief of Staff.</p>\n\n<p>It seems European nations had plenty of full Generals and even Field Marshals above them. I understand the US Army was smaller at the time, but during the Civil war, the Army did become very large but was still commanded by Major and Lieutenant generals. </p>\n\n<p>There is little cost to promoting someone to the rank and &quot;General&quot; without any modifiers (i.e. &quot;Brigadier&quot;/&quot;Major&quot;/&quot;Lieutenant&quot;) is the obvious rank for person in charge. For example, even small police departments are generally headed by a (full) police Chief, not an Assistant Chief, Deputy Chief or something else lower and I don&#39;t know of any small organizations that decided for fairness to larger organizations they should be headed by a &quot;Vice President&quot; because they were too small to warrant a (full) &quot;President&quot;. What was the downside of making its Army leaders full generals? Why was the US so stingy to its military leaders including war heroes like Washington in this regard?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
