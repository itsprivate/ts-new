This did not happen, and he was taken to the gulags.</p>\n\n<p>However, I&#39;m wondering whether it was common during WWII for Freemasons on opposing sides to believe that the bond of being a Mason would transcend the Axis/Ally boundary. Was there a lot of internationalist rhetoric among Masons during this period, whether German or otherwise? And if so, was this just an empty ideal (as it was for my g-g-grandfather), or did it ever actually happen that being a Mason protected people during the war or led to bonding between people on opposing sides? Or was it the case that most Masons were so patriotic as to value their allegiances in the war over any potential links with Masons from other countries?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
