This is also in plenty of movies. </p>\n\n<p>Most people then could get by on a bowl of broth, bread and meat, but there will be an entire table filled with giant mounds of fruits, vegetables, freshly cooked meats like an entire pig, and more. For the poorer classes, a single pig would cost an entire year of hard labor.</p>\n\n<p>In the shows I named, these mountains of food are usually just for 2-3 people and they might eat a small plate. Is there any accuracy in popular media to how much food these people ate? Was it just commonplace for rulers to have more food than they could ever eat realistically? Perhaps just as a centerpiece or to show off their wealth?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, what did they do with surplus food, was it ever donated to the poor? I realize I am talking about a 2000 year period from Rome to 20th century Europe, but I&#39;d love to know how this evolved over time. Perhaps they eventually realized how wasteful it was.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
