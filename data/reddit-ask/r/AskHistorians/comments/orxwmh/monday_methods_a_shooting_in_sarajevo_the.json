The War to End All Wars.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>In popular history narratives of the conflict with those names, it is not uncommon for writers or documentary-makers to utilise cliche metaphors or dramatic phrases to underscore the sheer scale, brutality, and impact of the fighting between 1914 - 1918. Indeed, it is perhaps <em>the</em> event which laid the foundations for the conflicts, revolutions, and transformations which characterised the “short 20th century”, to borrow a phrase from Eric Hobsbawm. It is no surprise then, that even before the Treaty of Versailles had been signed to formally end the war, people were asking a duo of questions which continues to generate debate to this day: </p>\n\n<p><strong>How did the war start? Why did it start?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Yet in attempting to answer those questions, postwar academics and politicians inevitably began to write with the mood of their times. In Weimar Germany, historians seeking to exonerate the previous German Empire for the blame that the <em>Diktat von Versailles</em> had supposedly attached to them were generously funded by the government and given unprecedented access to the archives; so long as their ‘findings’ showed that Germany was not to blame. In the fledgling Soviet Union, the revolutionary government made public any archival material which ‘revealed’ the bellicose and aggressive decisions taken by the Tsarist government which collapsed during the war. In attempting to answer <em>how</em> the war had started, these writers were all haunted by the question which their theses, source selection, and areas of focus directly implied: <strong><em>who</em></strong> started it? </p>\n\n<p>Ever since Fritz Fischer’s seminal work in the 1960s, the historiography on the origins of  World War I have evolved ever further still, with practices and areas of focus constantly shifting as more primary sources are brought to light. This Monday Methods post will therefore identify and explain those shifts both in terms of methodological approaches to the question(s) and key ‘battlegrounds’, so to speak, when it comes to writing about the beginning of the First World War. Firstly however, are two sections with the bare-bones facts and figures we must be aware of when studying a historiographical landscape as vast and varied as this one. </p>\n\n<h1><strong>Key Dates</strong></h1>\n\n<p>To even begin to understand the origins of the First World War, it is essential that we have a firm grasp of the key sequence of events which unfolded during the <strong>July Crisis</strong> in 1914. Of course, to <em>confine</em> our understanding of key dates and ‘steps’ to the Crisis is to go against the norm in historiography; as historians from the late 1990s onwards have normalised (and indeed emphasise) investigating the longer-term developments which created Europe’s geopolitical and diplomatic situation in 1914. However, the bulk of analyses still centers around the decisions made between the <strong>28th of June</strong> and the <strong>4th of August</strong>, so that is the timeline I have stuck to below. Note that this is <em>far</em> from a comprehensive timeline, and it certainly simplifies many of the complex decision-making processes to their final outcome. </p>\n\n<p>It goes without saying that this timeline also omits mentions of those “minor powers” who would later join the war: Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire, as well as three other “major” powers: Japan, the United States, and Italy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>28 June:</strong> Gavrilo Princip assassinates Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Duchess Sophie in Sarajevo, he and six fellow conspirators are arrested and their connection to Serbian nationalist groups is identified. </p>\n\n<p><strong>28 June - 4 July:</strong> The Austro-Hungarian foreign ministry and imperial government discuss what actions to take against Serbia. The prevailing preference is for a policy of immediate and direct aggression, but Hungarian Prime Minister Tisza fiercely opposes such a course. Despite this internal discourse, it is clear to all in Vienna that Austria-Hungary must secure the support of Germany before proceeding any further.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4 July:</strong> Count Hoyos is dispatched to Berlin by night train with two documents: a signed letter from Emperor Franz Joseph to his counterpart Wilhelm II, and a post-assassination amended version of the Matscheko memorandum. </p>\n\n<p><strong>5 July:</strong> Hoyos meets with Arthur Zimmerman, under-secretary of the Foreign Office, whilst ambassador Szogyenyi meets with Wilhelm II to discuss Germany’s support for Austria-Hungary. That evening the Kaiser meets with Zimmerman, adjutant General Plessen, War Minister Falkenhayn, and Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg to discuss their initial thoughts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6 July:</strong> Bethmann-Hollweg receives Hoyos and Szogyenyi to notify them of the official response. The infamous “Blank Cheque” is issued during this meeting, and German support for Austro-Hungarian action against Serbia is secured. </p>\n\n<p>In Vienna, Chief of Staff Count Hotzendorff informs the government that the Army will not be ready for immediate deployment against Serbia, as troops in key regions are still on harvest leave until July 25th. </p>\n\n<p>In London, German ambassador Lichnowsky reports to Foreign Secretary Grey that Berlin is supporting Austria-Hungary in her aggressive stance against Serbia, and hints that if events lead to war with Russia, it would be better now than later. </p>\n\n<p><strong>7 July - 14 July:</strong> The Austro-Hungarian decision makers agree to draft an ultimatum to present to Serbia, and that failure to satisfy their demands will lead to a declaration of war. Two key dates are decided upon: the ultimatum’s draft is to be checked and approved by the Council of Ministers on 19 July, and presented to Belgrade on 23 July.</p>\n\n<p><strong>15 July:</strong> French President Poincare, Prime Minister Vivani, and political director at the Foreign Ministry Pierre de Margerie depart for St. Petersburg for key talks with Tsar Nicholas II and his ministers. They arrive on 20 July.</p>\n\n<p><strong>23 July:</strong> As the French statesmen depart St. Petersburg - having reassured the Russian government of their commitment to the Russo-Franco Alliance - the Austro-Hungarian government presents their ultimatum to Belgrade. They are given 48 hours to respond. The German foreign office under von Jagow have already viewed the ultimatum, and express approval of its terms. </p>\n\n<p>Lichnowsky telegrams Berlin to inform them that Britain will back the Austro-Hungarian demands only if they are “moderate” and “reconcilable with the independence of Serbia”. Berlin responds that it will not interfere in the affairs of Vienna.</p>\n\n<p><strong>24 July</strong>: Sazonov hints that Russian intervention in a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia is likely, raising further concern in Berlin. Grey proposes to Lichnowsky that a “conference of the ambassadors” take place to mediate the crisis, but critically leaves Russia out of the countries to be involved in such a conference.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian Council of Ministers asks Tsar Nicholas II to agree “in principle” to a partial mobilization against only Austria-Hungary, despite warnings from German ambassador Pourtales that the matter should be left to Vienna and Belgrade, without further intervention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>25 July:</strong> At 01:16, Berlin receives notification of Grey’s suggestion from Lichnowsky. They delay forwarding this news to Vienna until 16:00, by which point the deadline on the ultimatum has already expired. </p>\n\n<p>At a meeting with Grey, Lichnowsky suggests that the great powers mediate between Austria-Hungary and Russia instead, as Vienna will likely refuse the previous mediation offer. Grey accepts these suggestions, and Berlin is hurriedly informed of this new option for preventing war. </p>\n\n<p>Having received assurance of Russian support from Foreign Minister Sazonov the previous day, the Serbians respond to the Austrian ultimatum. They accept most of the terms, request clarification on some, any outrightly reject one. Serbian mobilization is announced.</p>\n\n<p>In St. Petersburg, Nicholas II announces the “Period Preparatory to War”, and the Council of Ministers secure his approval for partial mobilization against only Austria-Hungary. The Period regulations will go into effect the next day. </p>\n\n<p><strong>26 July:</strong> Grey once again proposes a conference of ambassadors from Britain, Italy, Germany, and France to mediate between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Russia is also contacted for its input.</p>\n\n<p>France learns of German precautionary measures and begins to do the same. Officers are recalled to barracks, railway lines are garrisoned, and draft animals purchased in both countries. Paris also requests that Vivani and Poincare, who are still sailing in the Baltic, to cancel all subsequent stops and return immediately.</p>\n\n<p><strong>27 July:</strong> Responses to Grey’s proposal are received in London. Italy accepts with some reservations, Russia wishes to wait for news from Vienna regarding their proposals for mediation, and Germany rejects the idea. At a cabinet meeting, Grey’s suggestion that Britain may need to intervene is met with opposition from an overwhelming majority of ministers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>28 July</strong>: Franz Joseph signs the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia, and a localized state of war between the two countries officially begins. The Russian government publicly announces a partial mobilization in response to the Austro-Serbian state of war; it into effect the following day.</p>\n\n<p>Austria-Hungary firmly rejects both the Russian attempts at direct talks and the British one for mediation. In response to the declaration of war, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill orders the Royal Navy to battle stations. </p>\n\n<p><strong>30 July:</strong> The Russian government orders a general mobilization, the first among the Great Powers in 1914. </p>\n\n<p><strong>31 July:</strong> The Austro-Hungarian government issues its order for general mobilization, to go into effect the following day. In Berlin, the German government decides to declare the <em>Kriegsgefahrzustand,</em> or State of Imminent Danger of War, making immediate preparations for a general mobilization. </p>\n\n<p><strong>1 August:</strong> A general mobilization is declared in Germany, and the Kaiser declares war on Russia. In line with the Schlieffen Plan, German troops begin to invade Luxembourg at 7:00pm. The French declare their general mobilization in response to the Germans and to honour the Franco-Russian Alliance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2 August:</strong> The German government delivers an ultimatum to the Belgian leadership: allow German troops to pass the country in order to launch an invasion of France. King Albert I and his ministers reject the ultimatum, and news of their decision reaches Berlin, Paris, and London the following morning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3 August:</strong> After receiving news of the Belgian rejection, the German government declares war on France first.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4 August:</strong> German troops invade Belgium, and in response to this violation of neutrality (amongst other reasons), the British government declares war on Germany. Thus ends the July Crisis, and so begins the First World War. </p>\n\n<h1><strong>Key Figures</strong></h1>\n\n<p>When it comes to understanding the outbreak of the First World War as a result of the “July Crisis” of 1914, one must inevitably turn some part of their analysis to focus on those statesmen who staffed and served the governments of the to-be belligerents. Yet in approaching the July Crisis as such, historians must be careful not to fall into yet another reductionist trap: Great Man Theory. Although these statesmen had key roles and chose paths of policy which critically contributed to the “long march” or “dominoes falling”, they were in turn influenced by historical precedents, governmental prejudices, and personal biases which may have spawned from previous crises. To pin the blame solely on one, or even a group, of these men is to suggest that their decisions were the ones that caused the war - a claim which falls apart instantly when one considers just how interlocking and dependent those decisions were.</p>\n\n<p>What follows is a list of the individuals whose names have been mentioned and whose decisions have been analysed by the more recent historical writings on the matter - that is, those books and articles which were published between 1990 to the current day. This is by no means an exhaustive introduction to all those men who served in a position of power from 1900 to 1914, but rather those whose policies and actions have been scrutinized for their part in shifting the geopolitical and diplomatic balance of Europe in the leadup to war. The more recent shift in approaches and focuses of historiography have spent plenty of time investigating the influence (or lack thereof) of ambassadors which each of the major powers sent to all the other major powers up until the outbreak of war. The ones included on this list are marked with a (*) at the end of their name, though once again this is by no means a complete list.</p>\n\n<p>The persons are organised in chronological order based on the years in which they held their most well-known (and usually most analysed) position: </p>\n\n<h3>Austria-Hungary:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Franz Joseph I (1830 - 1916) - Monarch (1848 - 1916)</li>\n<li>Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1863 - 1914) - Heir Presumptive (1896 - 1914) </li>\n<li>Count István Imre Lajos Pál Tisza de Borosjenő et Szeged (1861 - 1918) - Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Hungary (1903 - 1905, 1913 - 1917)</li>\n<li>Alois Leopold Johann Baptist Graf Lexa von Aehrenthal (1854 - 1912) - Foreign Minister (1906 - 1912)</li>\n<li>Franz Xaver Josef Conrad von Hötzendorf (1852 - 1925) - Chief of the General Staff of the Army and Navy (1906 -1917)</li>\n<li>Leopold Anton Johann Sigismund Josef Korsinus Ferdinand Graf Berchtold von und zu Ungarschitz, Frättling und Püllütz (1863 - 1942) - Joint Foreign Minister (1912 - 1915) More commonly referred to as Count Berchtold</li>\n<li>Ludwig Alexander Georg Graf von Hoyos, Freiherr zu Stichsenstein (1876 - 1937) - Chef de cabinet of the Imperial Foreign Minister (1912 - 1917)</li>\n<li>Ritter Alexander von Krobatin (1849 - 1933) - Imperial Minister of War (1912 - 1917) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>French Third Republic</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Émile François Loubet (1838 - 1929) - Prime Minister (1892 - 1892) and President (1899 - 1906)</li>\n<li>Théophile Delcassé (1852 - 1923) - Foreign Minister (1898 - 1905)</li>\n<li>Pierre Paul Cambon* (1843 - 1924) - Ambassador to Great Britain (1898 - 1920)</li>\n<li>Jules-Martin Cambon* (1845 - 1935) - Ambassador to Germany (1907 - 1914)</li>\n<li>Adople Marie Messimy (1869 - 1935) - Minister of War (1911 - 1912, 1914-1914)</li>\n<li>Joseph Joffre (1852 - 1931) - Chief of the Army Staff (1911 - 1914)</li>\n<li>Raymond Nicolas Landry Poincaré (1860 - 1934) - Prime Minister (1912 - 1913) and President (1913 - 1920)</li>\n<li>Maurice Paléologue* (1859 - 1944) - Ambassador to Russia (1914 - 1917)</li>\n<li>Rene Vivani (1863 - 1925) - Prime Minister (1914 - 1915)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Great Britain:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury (1830 - 1903) - Prime Minister (1895 - 1902) and Foreign Secretary (1895 - 1900)</li>\n<li>Edward VII (1841 - 1910) - King (1901 - 1910)</li>\n<li>Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour (1848 - 1930) - Prime Minister (1902 - 1905)</li>\n<li>Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst* (1858 - 1944) - Ambassador to Russia (1904 - 1906)</li>\n<li>Francis Leveson Bertie, 1st Viscount Bertie of Thame* (1844 - 1919) - Ambassador to France (1905 - 1918)</li>\n<li>Sir William Edward Goschen, 1st Baronet* (1847 - 1924) - Ambassador to Austria-Hungary (1905 - 1908) and Germany (1908 - 1914)</li>\n<li>Sir Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon (1862 - 1933) - Foreign Secretary (1905 - 1916)</li>\n<li>Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane (1856 - 1928) - Secretary of State for War (1905 - 1912)</li>\n<li>Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock* (1849 - 1928) - Ambassador to Russia (1906 - 1910)</li>\n<li>Herbert Henry Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith (1852 - 1928) - Prime Minister (1908 - 1916)</li>\n<li>David Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor (1863 - 1945) - Chancellor of the Exchequer (1908 - 1915)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>German Empire:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Otto von Bismarck (1815 - 1898) - Chancellor (1871 - 1890)</li>\n<li>Georg Leo Graf von Caprivi de Caprera de Montecuccoli (1831 - 1899) - Chancellor (1890 - 1894)</li>\n<li>Friedrich August Karl Ferdinand Julius von Holstein (1837 - 1909) - Head of the Political Department of the Foreign Office (1876?

Following the debate on Fischer’s thesis in the 1960s, historians have begun looking beyond the events of June - August 1914 in order to understand why the assassination of an archduke was <em>the</em> ‘spark’ which lit the powderkeg of the continent. </p>\n\n<p>1914 was not a “<strong>critical year</strong>” where tensions were at their highest in the century. Plenty of other crises had occurred beforehand, namely the two Moroccan crises of 1905-06 and 1911, the Bosnian Crisis of 1908-09, and <em>two</em> Balkan Wars in 1912-13. Why did Europe not go to war as a result of any of these crises? What made the events of 1914 unique, both in the conditions present across the continent, and within the governments themselves, that ultimately led to the outbreak of war?</p>\n\n<p>Even within popular history narratives, these events have slowly but surely been integrated into the larger picture of the leadup to 1914. Even a cursory analysis of these crises reveals several interesting notes: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Entente Powers, not the Triple Alliance, were the ones who tended to first utilise military diplomacy/deterrence, and often to a greater degree. </li>\n<li>Mediation by other ‘concerned powers’ was, more often than not, a viable and indeed desirable outcome which those nations directly involved in the crises accepted without delay.</li>\n<li>The strength of the alliance systems with mutual defense clauses, namely the Triple Alliance and the Franco-Russian Alliance, were shaky at best during these crises. France discounted Russian support against Germany in both Moroccan crises for example, and Germany constantly urged restraint to Vienna in its Balkan policy (particularly towards Serbia). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even beyond the diplomatic history of these crises, historians have also analysed the impact of <strong>other aspects</strong> in the years preceding 1914. William Mulligan, for example, argues that the economic conditions in those years generated heightened tensions as the great powers competed for dwindling markets and industries. Plenty of recent journal articles have outlined the growth of nationalist fervour and irredentist movements in the Balkans, and public opinion has begun to re-occupy a place in such investigations - though not, we must stress, with quite the same weight that it once carried in the historiography.</p>\n\n<p>Yet perhaps the most often-written about aspect of the years prior to 1914 links directly with another key focus in the current historiography: <strong>militarization</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Militarization</h2>\n\n<p>In the historiography of the First World War, militarization is a rather large elephant in the room. Perhaps the most famous work with this focus is A.J.P Taylor’s <em>War by Timetable: How the First World War Began</em> (1969), though the approach he takes there is perhaps best summarised by another propagator of the ‘mobilization argument’, George Quester: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“World War I broke out as a spasm of <strong>pre-emptive mobilization schedules.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words: Europe was ‘<strong>dragged</strong>’ into a war by the great powers’ heightened state of militarization, and the interlocking series of mobilization plans which, once initiated, could not be stopped. I have written at some length on this argument here, as well as more specific analysis of the Schlieffen-Moltke plan here, but the general consensus in the current historiography is that this argument <strong>is weak</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>To suggest that the mobilization plans and the militarized governments of 1914 created the conditions for an ‘inadvertent war’ is to also suggest that the civilian officials had “<strong>lost control</strong>” of the situation, and that they “capitulated” to the generals on the decision to go to war. Indeed some of the earliest works on the First World War went along with this claim, in no small part because several civilian leaders of 1914 alleged as such in their memoirs published after the war. Albertini’s bold statement about the decision-making within the German government in 1914 notes that: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“At the decisive moment the <strong>military took over the direction of affairs</strong> and imposed their law.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the 1990s, a new batch of secondary literature from historians and political scientists began to contest this long standing claim. They argued that despite the militarization of the great powers and the mobilization plans, the civilian statesmen remained firmly in control of policy, and that the decision to go to war was a conscious one that they made, fully aware of the consequences of such a choice. </p>\n\n<p>The generals were not, as Barbara Tuchmann exaggeratedly wrote, “pounding the table for the signal to move.”. Indeed, in Vienna the generals were doing quite the opposite: early in the July Crisis Chief of the General Staff Conrad von Hotzendorf remarked to Foreign Minister Berchtold that the army would only be able to commence operations against Serbia on August 12, and that they would not even be able to mobilise until after the harvest leave finished on July 25. </p>\n\n<p>These rebuttals of the “inadvertent war” thesis have proven to be better substantiated and more persuasive, thus the current norm in historiography has shifted to look further within the halls of power in 1914. That is, the analyses have shifted to look beyond the generals, mobilization plans, and military staff; and instead towards the diplomats, ministers, and <strong>decision-makers.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Decision Makers</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Who occupied the halls of power both during the leadup to 1914 and whilst the crisis was unfolding? What decisions did they make and what impact did those actions have on the larger geopolitical/diplomatic situation of their nation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although Europe was very much a continent of monarchs in 1900, those monarchs did not hold supreme power over their respective apparatus of state. Even the most autocratic of the great powers at the time, Russia, possessed a council of ministers which convened at critical moments during the July Crisis to decide on their country’s response to Austro-Hungarian aggression. Contrast that to the most ‘democratic’ country of the great powers, France (in that the Third Republic did not have a monarch), and the confusing enigma that was the foreign ministry - occupying the Quai D’Orsay - and it becomes clear that understanding what motivated and influenced the men (and they were all men) who held/shared the reigns of policy is tantamount to better understanding how events progressed the way they did in 1914.</p>\n\n<p>A good example of just how many <em>dramatis personae</em> have become involved in the current historiography can be found in Margaret Macmillan’s chatty pop-history work, <em>The War that Ended Peace</em> (2014). Her characterizations and side-tracks about such figures as Lord Salisbury, Friedrich von Holstein, and Theophile Delcasse are not out of step with contemporary academic monographs. Entire narratives and investigations have been published about the role of an individual in the leadup to the events of the July Crisis, Mombauer’s <em>Helmuth von Moltke and the Origins of the First World War</em> (2001) or T.G Otte’s <em>Statesman of Europe: A Life of Sir Edward Grey</em> (2020) stand out in this regard. </p>\n\n<p>Not only has the cast become more civilian and larger in the past few decades, but it has also come to recognise the plurality of decision-making during 1914. Historians now stress that disagreements <em>within</em> governments (alongside those between them) are equally important to understand the many voices of European decision-making before as well as during 1914. Naturally, this focus reaches its climax in the days of the July Crisis, where narratives now emphasise in minutiae just how divided the halls of power were. </p>\n\n<p>Alongside these changes in focus with the people who contributed to (or warned against) the decision to go to war, recent narratives have begun to highlight the voices of those who represented their governments abroad; the ambassadors. Likewise, newer historiographical works have re-focused their lenses on <strong>diplomatic history</strong> prior to the war. Within this field, one particular process and area of investigation stands out: the <strong>polarization</strong> of Europe.</p>\n\n<h2>Polarization, or &quot;Big Causes&quot;</h2>\n\n<p>Prior to the developments within First World War historiography from the 1990s onwards, it was not uncommon for historians and politicians - at least in the interwar period - to propagate theses which pinned the war’s origins on factors of “mass demand”: nationalism, militarism, and social Darwinism among them. These biases not only impacted their interpretations of the events building up to 1914, as well as the July Crisis itself, but also imposed an overarching thread; an omnipresent motivator which guided (and at times “forced”) the decision-makers to commit to courses of action which moved the continent one step closer to war.</p>\n\n<p>These overarching theories have since been refuted by historians, and the current historiographical approach emphasises case-specific analyses of each nation’s circumstances, decisions, and impact in both crises and diplomacy. Whilst these investigations have certainly yielded key patterns and preferences within the diplomatic maneuvers of each nation, they sensibly stop short of suggesting that these <em>modus operandi</em> were inflexible to different scenarios, or that they even persisted as the decision-makers came and went. The questions now revolve around <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> the diplomacy of the powers shifted in the years prior to 1914, and how the division of Europe into “two armed camps” </p>\n\n<p>What all of these new focuses imply - indeed what they necessitate - is that historians utilise a <strong>transnational</strong> approach when attempting to explain the origins of the war. Alan Kramer goes so far as to term it the <em>sine qua non</em> (essential condition) in the current historiography; a claim that many historians would be inclined to agree with. Of course, that is not to suggest that a good work must not give more focus to one (or a group) of nations over the others, but works which focus on a single nation’s path to war are rarer than they were prior to this recent shift in focus. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, there we have a general overview of how the focuses of historiography on the First World War have shifted in the past 30 years, and it would perhaps not be too far-fetched to suggest that these focuses may very well change in and of themselves within the next 30 years too. The next section shall deal with how, within these focuses, there are various stances which historians have argued and adopted in their approach to explaining the origins of the First World War.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Battlegrounds:</strong></h1>\n\n<h2><strong>Personalities vs. Precedents</strong></h2>\n\n<p>To suggest that the First World War was the fault of a group of decision-makers is leaning dangerously close to reducing the role that those officials played in the leadup to the conflict - not to mention to dismiss outright those practices and precedents which characterised their country’s policy preferences prior to 1914. There was, as hinted at previously, no dictator at the helm of any of the powers; the plurality of cabinets, imperial ministries, and advisory bodies meant that the personalities of those decision-makers must be analysed in light of their influence on the larger national, and transnational state of affairs. </p>\n\n<p>To then suggest that the “larger forces” of mass demand served as invisible guides on these men is to dismiss the complex and unique set of considerations, fears, and desires which descended upon Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, London, Vienna, and Belgrade in July of 1914. Though these forces may have constituted some of those fears and considerations, they were by no means the powerful structural factors which plagued all the countries during the July Crisis. Holger Herwig sums up this stance well: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The ‘big causes,’ by themselves, did not cause the war. To be sure, the system of secret alliances, militarism, nationalism, imperialism, social Darwinism, and the domestic strains… had all contributed toward forming the <em>mentalite,</em> the assumptions (both spoken and unspoken) of the ‘men of 1914.’[But] it does injustice to the ‘men of 1914’ to suggest that they were all merely agents - willing or unwilling - of some grand, impersonal design… No dark, overpowering, informal, yet irresistible forces brought on what George F. Kennan called ‘<em>the</em> great seminal tragedy of this century.’ It was, in each case, the work of human beings.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have therefore termed this battleground one of “personalities” against “precedents”, because although historians are now quick to dismiss the work of larger forces as crucial in explaining the origins of the war, they are still inclined to analyse the extent to which these forces influenced each body of decision-makers in 1914 (as well as previous crises). Within each nation, indeed within each of the government officials, there were precedents which changed and remained from previous diplomatic crises. Understanding <em>why</em> they changed (or hadn’t), as well as determining how they factored into the decision-making processes, is to move several steps closer to fully grasping the complex developments of July 1914. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Intention vs. Prevention</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Tied directly to the debate over the personalities and their own motivations for acting the way they did is the debate over intention and prevention. To identify the key figures who pressed for war and those who attempted to push for peace is perhaps tantamount to assigning blame in some capacity. Yet historians once again have become more aware of the plurality of decision-making. Moltke and Bethmann-Hollweg may have been pushing for a war with Russia sooner rather than later, but the Kaiser and foreign secretary Jagow preferred a localized war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Likewise, Edward Grey may have desired to uphold Britain’s honour by coming to France’s aid, but until the security of Belgium became a serious concern a vast majority of the House of Commons preferred neutrality or mediation to intervention. </p>\n\n<p>This links back to the focus mentioned earlier about how these decision-makers came to make the decisions they did during the July Crisis. What finally swayed those who had held out for peace to authorise war? Historians now have discarded the notion that the generals and military “took control” of the process at critical stages, so now we must further investigate the shifts in thinking and circumstances which impacted the policy preferences of the “men of 1914”. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the best summary of this battleground and the need to understand how these decision-makers came to make the fateful choices they did is best summarized by Margaret Macmillan: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;There are so many questions and as many answers again. Perhaps the most we can hope for is to understand as best we can those individuals, who had to make the choices between war and peace, and their strengths and weaknesses, their loves, hatreds, and biases. To do that we must also understand their world, with its assumptions. We must remember, as the decision-makers did, what had happened before that last crisis of 1914 and what they had learned from the Moroccan crises, the Bosnian one, or the events of the First Balkan Wars. Europe’s very success in surviving those earlier crises paradoxically led to a dangerous complacency in the summer of 1914 that, yet again, solutions would be found at the last moment and the peace would be maintained.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>Contingency vs. Certainty</strong></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No sovereign or leading statesmen in any of the belligerent countries sought or desired war - certainly not a European war.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above remark by David Llyod George in 1936 reflects a dangerous theme that has been thoroughly discredited in recent historiography: the so-called “slide” thesis. That is, the belief that the war was not a deliberate choice by any of the statesmen of Europe, and that the continent as a whole simply - to use another oft-quoted phrase from Llyod George - “slithered over the brink into the boiling cauldron of war”. The statesmen of Europe were well aware of the consequences of their choices, and explicitly voiced their awareness of the possibility of war at multiple stages of the July Crisis. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, to suggest that there was a collective responsibility for the war - a stance which remained dominant in the immediate postwar writings until the 1960s - is to also neutralize the need to reexamine the choices taken during the July Crisis. If everyone had a part to play, then what difference would it make if Berlin or London or St. Petersburg was the one that first moved towards armed conflict? This argument once again brings up the point of inadvertence as opposed to intention. Despite Christopher Clark’s admirable attempt to suggest that the statesmen were “blind to the reality of the horror they were about to bring into the world”, the evidence put forward <em>en masse</em> by other historians suggest quite the opposite. Herwig remarks once again that this inadvertent “slide” into war was far from the case with the statesmen of 1914: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In each of the countries…, a coterie of no more than about a dozen civilian and military rulers weighed their options, calculated their chances, and then made the decision for war…. Many decision makers knew the risk, knew that wider involvement was probable, yet proceeded to take the next steps. Put differently, fully aware of the likely consequences, they initiated policies that they knew were likely to bring on the catastrophe.”  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the debate now lies with ascertaining at what point during the July Crisis the “window” for a peaceful resolution to the crisis finally closed, and when war (localized or continental) was all but certain. A.J.P Taylor remarked rather aptly that “no war is inevitable until it breaks out”, and determining when exactly the path to peace was rejected by each of the belligerent powers is crucial to that most notorious of tasks when it comes to explaining the causes of World War I: placing blame. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Responsibility</strong></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“After the war, it became apparent in Western Europe generally, and in America as well, that the Germans would never accept a peace settlement based on the notion that they had been responsible for the conflict. If a true peace of reconciliation were to take shape, it required a new theory of the origins of the war, and the easiest thing was to assume that no one had really been responsible for it. The conflict could readily be blamed on great impersonal forces - on the alliance system, on the arms race and on the military system that had evolved before 1914. <strong>On their uncomplaining shoulders the burden of guilt could be safely placed.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea of collective responsibility for the First World War, as described by Marc Trachtenberg above, still carries some weight in the historiography today. Yet it is no longer, as noted previously, the dominant idea amongst historians. Nor, for that matter, is the other ‘extreme’ which Fischer began suggesting in the 1960s: that the burden of guilt, the label of responsibility, and thus the blame, could be placed (or indeed forced) upon the shoulders of a single nation or group of individuals. </p>\n\n<p>The interlocking, multilateral, and dynamic diplomatic relations between the European powers prior to 1914 means that to place the blame on one is to propose that their policies, both in response to and independent of those which the other powers followed, were deliberately and entirely bellicose. The pursuit of these policies, both in the long-term and short-term, then created conditions which during the July Crisis culminated in <em>the</em> fatal decision to declare war. To adopt such a stance in one’s writing is to dangerously assume several considerations that recent historiography has brought to the fore and rightly warned against possessing: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>That the decision-making in each of the capitals was an autocratic process, in which opposition was either insignificant to the key decision-maker or entirely absent,</li>\n<li>That a ‘greater’ force motivated the decision-makers in a particular country, and that the other nations were powerless to influence or ignore the effect of this ‘guiding hand’, </li>\n<li>That any anti-war sentiments or conciliatory diplomatic gestures prior to 1914 (as well as during the July Crisis) were abnormalities; case-specific aberrations from the ‘general’ pro-war pattern,</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As an aside,  the most recent book in both academic and popular circles to attempt such an approach is most likely Sean McMeekin’s <em>The Russian Origins of the First World War</em> (2011), with limited success.  </p>\n\n<p>To conclude, when it comes to the current historiography on the origins of the First World War, the ‘blame game’ which is heavily associated with the literature on the topic has reached at least something resembling a consensus: this was not a war enacted by one nation above all others, nor a war which all the European powers consciously or unconsciously found themselves obliged to join. Contingency, the mindset of decision-makers, and the rapidly changing diplomatic conditions are now the landscapes which academics are analyzing more thoroughly than ever, refusing to paint broad strokes (the “big” forces) and instead attempting to specify, highlight, and differentiate the processes, persons, and prejudices which, in the end, deliberately caused the war to break out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
