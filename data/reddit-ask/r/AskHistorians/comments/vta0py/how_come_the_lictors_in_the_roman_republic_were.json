This creates an interesting question - what made the lictors of the Roman Republic trustworthy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, during the almost 500 years from the founding of the Roman Empire to the Western Roman Empire&amp;#39;s fall, 13 Roman Emperors were murdered by the Praetorian Guard. Yet the Roman Republic existed for a similar (if not longer) amount of time, but not a single consul was murdered by the lictors (or perhaps the documentation is missing?). Even as the Republic grew increasingly corrupted, unstable and dictator-prone, the lictors didn&amp;#39;t kill any of the consuls or dictators. What was the reason they were more loyal than the Praetorian Guard?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, why did the Empire abandon the system of lictors if that system seemed to work better than the Praetorian Guard system they replaced it with?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
