Especially because events like Ling Tong’s impressment (for lack of a better word to describe marching around in shiny armor to impress Shanyue) and the continued native control of Fujian by states like Donghai and Yueyao (if I’m understanding Brindley 2015 correctly) make it seem like control in those areas were more nominal or tributary than vassal (like most of China was pre-Wudi) or directly administrative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to ask some Han specialists. What did this initial migration wave look like, to both settlers and natives? If they were fleeing landlords, why keep their original culture instead of integrating into native mutual support and diplomatic systems, as many European settlers did the early days of American colonization? How did they learn southern farming techniques? What was the mortality rate like given that they were entering a completely new tropical environment? How did both settlers and natives perceive their relationship with the Han central government? Is it possible that it was more like what we now know of early Mesoamerican contact, where natives perceived their “emperors” as more like useful foreign allies? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m coming into this with too many preconceptions from American Indian studies lol, sorry for the long post and thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
