The Vietnam War was never formally declared, for example. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war#Declared_wars_since_1945\"&gt;However, it does seem like Middle-Eastern / African nations still formally declare war - why is that?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did the &amp;quot;formal declaration of war&amp;quot; ever serve a useful purpose?
