With that in mind I don&amp;#39;t want to necessarily limit the question to cuneiform but that&amp;#39;s what I was thinking about when it came to mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For cuneiform tablets though, do they just look through them randomly until they see something interesting to them, like perusing through headlines almost? Or is there more of a system than that? I&amp;#39;m sure the location they were in found plays an important role in that but even within collections found at a single site there must be some sort of process. I assume most tablets have been digitized by this point, are people able to run keyword searches in those databases to find what they&amp;#39;re looking for faster, even if nobody has actually read that text yet, or is that not feasible? Is it likely that there is important or groundbreaking information on a tablet buried somewhere in the collection that just hasn&amp;#39;t been read yet?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
