Within 50 years of the overthrow of the monarchy and annexation of Hawaii, the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States of America into World War 2 happened. I know from some other reading that members of the Royal family bother survived the Annexation and, in fact, are still alive today. Did any members of the Royal Family have any type of official response to the bombing or the US joining the War in general? How did native Hawaiians respond to the bombing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
