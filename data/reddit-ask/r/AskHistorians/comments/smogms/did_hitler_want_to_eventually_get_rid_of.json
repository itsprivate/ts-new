Yesterday I was having an argument with a friend about whether or not the Third Reich was a Christian state. I was arguing that it wasn’t. Hitler just wanted to keep Christianity around for the time being to keep Germany stable during World War II and that had he succeeded he would’ve gotten rid of it later because a religion that preaches that you should be loyal to something other than the state (God) would not be great for an authoritarian like Hitler. My friend on the other hand was arguing that Nazi Germany was “super Christian” and he cited the fact that multiple German Churches and Christian organizations openly sided with Hitler and that most of the Wehrmacht’s uniforms had the phrase “Gott Mit Uns” on them. I argued that the Christian Churches and Organizations were only siding with Hitler so they would not face the same fate as the Jews. I also argued that the phrase “Gott Mit Uns” had been used by Prussia for 240 years at the point and that Hitler wasn’t going to just get rid of it. Anyway we both walked away frustrated because neither of us could convince the other that they were wrong. Can you guys help settle this by telling me who is correct? And please send evidence from credible sources because if I am right then my friend still won’t believe me unless I have credible sources to back up my claim. Thank You.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
