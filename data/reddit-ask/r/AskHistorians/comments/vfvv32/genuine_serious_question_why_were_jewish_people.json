All of these figures bar Potanin, Smolensky and Vinogradov, so 6/9, are of Jewish heritage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same page has a similar list of the most prominent oligarchs of Putin&amp;#39;s era:  Roman Abramovich, Alexander Abramov, Oleg Deripaska, Mikhail Prokhorov, Alisher Usmanov, German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg, Leonid Mikhelson, Vagit Alekperov, Mikhail Fridman, Dmitry Rybolovlev, Vladimir Potanin, Pyotr Aven, and Vitaly Malkin. Of these names, all are of Jewish heritage except Deripaksa, Usmanov, Alekperov, Rybolovlev and Potanin, so 9/14.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would just like to query how and why a group that constituted less than 1% of the population and went through periods of intense discrimination and mass emigration role to have so many influential and wealthy figures after the transition into capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
