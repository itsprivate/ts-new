As we are expecting many questions on the topic today, this Megathread will serve as a one-stop repository.</p>\n\n<p>On behalf of the mods and flaired community, <a href=\"/u/tlumacz\">/u/tlumacz</a> and I have put together an overview of the events surrounding the attacks of 9/11, including the history of relevant people and organizations such as Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda. This isn&#39;t meant to be the exhaustive, final word or a complete history. Instead, we want to provide the AH community with insight into the history and address some common misconceptions and misunderstandings that surround September 11th, 2001.</p>\n\n<p>This is a META thread, so we will be allowing some discussion beyond simple questions, but within limits.  If you are interested primarily in sharing your own experiences from that day, or discussing it with others, <a href=\"/r/history\">/r/history</a> is running a thread this week that is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/pl0vod/have_a_personal_recollection_of_911_that_youd/\">dedicated specifically for those types of comments</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the sources in this post we now have a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/terrorism\">large comprehensive booklist</a> put together by the flairs and mods.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Osama bin Laden and the formation of al-Qaeda</strong></p>\n\n<p>To best contextualize the events of the day, we’re going to start with Osama bin Laden. His father, billionaire Mohammed bin Laden, was one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed made his wealth from a construction empire but died when Osama was only 10, leaving behind 56 children and a massive fortune. The prominence of the family name and wealth are two important factors for understanding Osama&#39;s rise to power.</p>\n\n<p>The bin Ladens were generally Westernized and many members of the family frequently travelled or sought out education outside Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden, however, was upset at Saudi Arabia&#39;s close ties with the West and was more attracted to religious practices. The relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US was established in the 1940s when FDR signed a deal with King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, essentially giving the US primary access to oil in exchange for support and — essential to this history — defense from the US military.</p>\n\n<p>Osama bin Laden went to college at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in the late 70s. After graduating, he traveled to Afghanistan to help the freedom fighters — known as the mujahedeen — in their battle against the Soviets, who had invaded in 1979. Unlike some young men who joined the battles in Afghanistan and took a &quot;summer camp&quot; approach, spending a few months in training before going back to their home countries, Osama was a true believer. He stayed and committed to the fight. He used his leverage as a son of Mohammad bin Laden and his large yearly financial allowance to smooth over initial troubles integrating into the group. (Note: The United States, though the CIA, also were funding the Afghan freedom fighters against the Soviets. The funding didn’t end until 1992, long after Osama bin Laden had left -- the two were not affiliated.)</p>\n\n<p>The group al-Qaeda intended as a more global organization than the mujahideen, was founded in 1988 in order to further Islamic causes, Osama played a role in funding and leading from its inception. The Soviets withdrew the year after, and Osama bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia a hero, having helped bring down a superpower. Potentially rudderless, he was energized in the summer of 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. This event kicked off what is known as the Gulf War. Given Kuwait was adjacent to Saudi Arabia, and the enduring close relationship between the kingdom and the US  — hundreds of thousands of US troops were mobilized and housed in Saudi Arabia, with Saudi Arabia footing most of the bill.</p>\n\n<p>Osama bin Laden tried to pitch the fighters trained up from their years in Afghanistan as being up to the task of defending Kuwait as opposed to calling in the Americans, but his plea was rejected by the Saudi government (Note: to be fair, it is unlikely his force was large enough to handle the Iraqi military, the fourth largest military in the world at the time). This rejection, combined with the fact the US lingered for several years after the Gulf War ended, diverting resources from the Saudi Arabian people directly to the Americans, made an impression on Osama.</p>\n\n<p>He vocally expressed disgust, and given that the Saudi Royal Family did not tolerate dissent, soon left the country for Sudan (which had just had an Islamist coup) in 1991. Even from another country, Osama kept up his public disdain for Saudi Arabia; family members pleaded with him to stop, but he didn’t and eventually, he was kicked out for good: his citizenship was revoked.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, he  kept close contact with various terrorist groups — Sudan was a hub — and used the wealth he still possessed to build farming and construction businesses.</p>\n\n<p>His public resentment for the United States continued, and as he was clearly a power player, the CIA successfully pressured the leadership of Sudan into kicking Osama bin Laden out in 1997; his assets were confiscated and he started anew in Afghanistan, finding safe shelter with the ruling Taliban, a political movement and military force. The Taliban had essentially taken control of the country by 1996, although the civil war was still ongoing. Almost immediately after he arrived, bin Laden made a &quot;declaration of war&quot; against the US. He later explained: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We declare jihad against the United States because the US Government is an unjust, criminal, and abusive government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He objected to the US occupying Islam’s holy places (which included the Gulf War occupation), and had specific grievance with the US&#39;s continued support of Israel and the Saudi royals. For him, it was clearly  not just a religious matter, but also personal and political.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier that same year, the CIA established a special unit, based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, specifically for tracking Osama bin Laden They searched for a reason to bring charges, and finally had a break when Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl (code named &quot;Junior&quot;), one of the first to give allegiance to Osama, approached the Americans. He had stolen $100,000 from Osama and needed protection. In return, he offered details about organizational charts and most  importantly, a way to connect Osama to  the Black Hawk Down incident in Mogadishu in 1993. The CIA was working to gather enough evidence such that if the opportunity presented itself, he could be taken into custody for conspiring to attack the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the CIA worked to raise alarms among the military and intelligence communities. When George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 and first met Clinton at the White House, Clinton said</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think you will find that by far your biggest threat is bin Laden and the al-Qaeda. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some of the events that led to that assessment included the 1996 al-Qaeda-led attempted assassination plot on US President Bill Clinton while he was in Manila. (The Secret Service were  alerted and agents found a bomb under a bridge). In 1998,  al-Qaeda orchestrated attacks on US embassies in Africa that led to the deaths of hundreds. Then in 2000, they were responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole (suicide bombers in a small boat went alongside the destroyer, killing 17 crew members).</p>\n\n<p>By the time the warning about Al-Qaeda was shared with Bush, plans for what would later become known as 9/11 were well underway. The plan was put into motion when, in the summer of 2000, a number of Al-Qaeda members took up flight training in the United States. Final decisions, including target selection, were probably made in July 2001, when the terrorists’ field commander, Mohamed Atta, traveled to Spain for a meeting with his friend and now coordinator: Ramzi bin al-Shibh. The nineteen hijackers were divided into four groups, each with a certified pilot who would be able to guide the airliners into their targets plus three or four enforcers whose job it was to ensure that the terrorist pilot was able to successfully carry out his task. The hijacking itself was easy enough. The terrorists used utility knives and pepper spray to subdue the flight attendants and passengers.</p>\n\n<p>Before we go into the specifics of what happened on September 11, 2001, we want to address the idea of a “20th hijacker.” Tactically, it  makes sense to have equal teams of 5 men. While the identity of the would-be 20th hijacker has never been confirmed (nor has the reason for his dropping out of the operation been established), circumstances indicate he did exist and numerous hypotheses as to who the man was have been proposed. (The most prominent — Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted in federal court of conspiracy to commit terrorism — later said he was supposed to be involved in a different terrorist attack, after September 11th.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>September 11, 2001</strong></p>\n\n<p>Early in the morning of 9/11 four airliners took off from airports in the US East Coast: two Boeing 757s and two Boeing 767s, two of American Airlines and two of United Airlines. All four planes were scheduled to fly to California, on the US West Coast, which meant they carried a  large fuel load. The hijackers knew that once they redirected to their targets, they would still have most of that fuel. The two planes that struck the WTC towers had been in the air for less than an hour.</p>\n\n<p>American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower and United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center, in New York City. Both impacts damaged the utility shaft systems and jet fuel spilled down elevator shafts and ignited, crashing elevators and causing large fires in the lobbies of the buildings. Both buildings collapsed less than two hours later. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), tasked by the US Congress with investigating the cause of the buildings’ collapse, reported portions of the buildings reached 1000 degrees centigrade. (Note: Not only was jet fuel burning, so were desks, curtains, furniture, and other items within the WTC  While some like to point out this is under the &quot;melting point&quot; of steel [1510 centigrade],  this detail is absolutely irrelevant: the steel did not liquify. Consider the work of a blacksmith; they do not need to melt steel in order to bend it into shape. Steel starts to weaken at around 600 centigrade, and 1000 centigrade is sufficient to cause steel to lose 90% strength, so there was enough warping for both buildings to entirely lose their integrity.)</p>\n\n<p>A third, nearby tower was damaged by debris from the collapse of the other towers, causing large fires that compromised the building’s structural integrity. Internally, &quot;Column 79&quot; buckled, followed by Columns 80 and 81, leading to a progressive structural collapse where, as the NIST report puts it, &quot;The exterior façade on the east quarter of the building was just a hollow shell.&quot; This led to the core collapsing, followed by the exterior. (Note: There is a conspiracy theory related to a conversation the real estate developer Larry Silverstein, and owner of the building, had with the fire department commander. He was heard saying, &quot;We&#39;ve had such a terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.&quot; However, this is common firefighter terminology and simply refers to pulling out firefighters from a dangerous environment.)</p>\n\n<p>At 9:37 AM, the terrorist piloting American Airlines Flight 77 struck the Pentagon. The plane first hit the ground, causing one wing to disintegrate and the other to shear off. The body of the plane then hit the first floor, leaving a hole 75 feet wide. Things could have been much worse: the portion of the Pentagon hit was undergoing renovation so had a quarter of the normal number of employees; additionally, while 26 of the columns holding up the second floor were destroyed, it took half an hour before the floor above collapsed. This meant all of the people on the 2nd through 5th floors were able to safely escape. Meanwhile, the Pentagon itself is mostly concrete as it was built during WWII, while steel was being rationed. The steel that was used turned out to be placed in fortuitously beneficial ways. The pillars had been reinforced with steel in a spiral design (as opposed to hoops) and the concrete pillars were reinforced with overlapping steel beams. </p>\n\n<p>Note: There is a conspiracy theory that the Pentagon was struck by a missile rather than a plane. This is absurd for numerous reasons, one being the hundreds who saw the plane as it approached the Pentagon (some observers even recognized the plane’s livery as belonging to American Airlines.) Second, nearly all the passengers from the flight were later identified by DNA testing. Third, one of the first responders, a structural engineer, said</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the stone on one side of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I stood on a pile of debris that we later discovered contained the black box.… I held parts of uniforms from crew members in my hands, including body parts. Okay?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania. The passengers on the plane were able to overwhelm the enforcers and break into the cockpit.  The crash caused no structural damage, and took no lives, on the ground. </p>\n\n<p>We now need to rewind to what was happening immediately following the hijacking of the four planes. Controversy surrounds the immediate response of the US military to the attacks, with questions about why the airliners were not shot down (or, conversely, could they have legally been shot down.) In the end, the military response was stifled by communications chaos and the fact that by and large the terrorists did not leave enough time for a comprehensive reaction. The first fighters, F-15C Eagles from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, were scrambled after the first tower had already been hit. By the time Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy and Major Daniel Nash reached New York, the other WTC tower had been struck. Nash would later recall:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I remember shortly after takeoff you could see the smoke because it was so clear: the smoke from the towers burning. . . . And then we were about 70 miles out when they said, ‘a second aircraft has hit the World Trade Center.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An additional three fighters took to the air from Langley AFB in Virginia, at 0930. With just seven minutes left before American 77 would hit the Pentagon, the Langley jets would have been hard pressed to make it in time to see the impact, let alone to prevent it. In the end, it made no difference that in the initial confusion, they first  flew away from DC. Finally, two F-16s, those of Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney, took off from Andrews Air Force Base at 1042. Their task was  to intercept and destroy any hijacked airliner that might attempt to enter DC airspace. The rapidity of the order, however, meant that the F-16s were sent out unarmed. As a result, both pilots were acutely aware that their orders were, essentially, to commit suicide. They would have had to ram the incoming B757, with Sasseville ordering Penney to strike the tail while he would strike the nose. The chances of a successful ejection would have been minuscule. </p>\n\n<p>Note: modern airliners are very good at staying in the air even when not fully functional and are designed with a potential engine failure in mind. As a result, any plan hinging on “just damage and disable one of the engines” (for example, by striking it with the vertical stabilizer) carried unacceptable risk of failure: the fighter jet would have been destroyed either way, but while the pilot would have a better chance of surviving, Flight 93 could have continued on its way. Therefore, ramming the fuselage was the only method of attack which would have given a near-certainty of the B757 being stopped there and then.</p>\n\n<p>Further reports and inquiries, including the 9/11 Commission, revealed a stupefying degree of chaos and cover-ups at the higher levels of command on the day of the attacks. While “fog of war” was certainly a factor, and the FAA’s failure to communicate with NORAD exacerbated the chaos, the timeline of events later published by NORAD contradicted established facts and existing records and became a paramount example of a government agency trying to avoid blame for their errors throughout the sequence of events described here. Members of the 9/11 Commission identified these contradictions and falsehoods as a leading cause of conspiracy theories regarding the attacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What happened after</strong></p>\n\n<p>The aftermath, which is beyond the scope of this post, was global. Sympathy and unity came from nearly all corners of the world; a response of force was authorized by the US on September 18, 2001:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such  nations, organizations or persons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The joint US-British effort to eliminate the Taliban began on October 7, with France, Germany, Australia, and Canada also pledging support. Ground forces arrived in Afghanistan 12 days later, but most of the fighting happened between the Taliban and the Afghan rebels, who had been fighting against the Taliban all this time. The international support led to a quick sweep over Taliban strongholds in November: Taloqan, Bamiyan, Herat, Kabul, Jalalabad. The Taliban collapsed entirely and surrendered Kandahar on December 9th.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2001, Osama bin Laden was  tracked to caves southeast of Kabul, followed by an extensive firefight against the al-Qaeda led by Afghan forces. He  escaped on December 16, effectively ending the events of 2001.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have entered the third millennium through a gate of fire. If today, after the horror of 11 September, we see better, and we see further — we will realize that humanity is indivisible. New threats make no distinction between races, nations or regions. A new insecurity has entered every mind, regardless of wealth or status. A deeper awareness of the bonds that bind us all — in pain as in prosperity — has gripped young and old.</p>\n\n<p>-- Kofi Annan, seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2001/annan/lecture/\">in his December 2001 Nobel Lecture</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>....</p>\n\n<p>Below are some selected references; a much larger booklist can be found <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/terrorism\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Coll, S.
