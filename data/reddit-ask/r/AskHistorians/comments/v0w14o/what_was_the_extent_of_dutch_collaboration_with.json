  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a Jewish exchange student in the Netherlands, and I have become very curious about the Dutch narrative of the Holocaust/WWII.  My experience during the lead-up to Memorial Day and Liberation Day was that there was a lot of focus on Dutch resistance, and no mention of collaboration.  The Dutch narrative appears to be one of pride due to the very active resistance forces in the region.  I have visited multiple museums and taken tours in many cities, and this has always been the focus.   Throughout all this, my question has become--then why were 90% of the Dutch Jews murdered?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, recently I went on a tour through Amsterdam with a very passionate tour guide who, for the first time, asserted that collaboration between Dutch police in Amsterdam and the Nazis was extremely high, and that this was the reason for the disappearance of the Dutch Jews, and that Dutch people don&amp;#39;t like to discuss this aspect of Dutch history.  I found this very interesting, as the Jewish Museum in Amsterdam had presented a narrative of coexistence and prosperity until the Nazis came along.  So, I guess I&amp;#39;m asking; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is this narrative true?  Were the Netherlands truly a better place to be Jewish than most of the world?  Were Jews as assimilated as I have been told?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is the Dutch pride in resistance and WWII tolerance a &amp;#39;whitewashing&amp;#39; narrative or one that reflects a reality in which the Dutch had less collaboration with the Nazis and greater resistance efforts than most of Europe?  What I mean by collaboration is on the more local level, individuals acting out of hatred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What happened to the surviving Dutch Jews?  Were there any instances of anger or violence such as the Kielce pogrom in Poland?  Did they remain in refugee camps?  After that, where did they go?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As a bonus question: how do the Dutch remember the Jews?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
