Infantry tanks seem to be only a thing the British tried, and it seems like they tried it for a long time, with many of the wholesale British tanks of the war being slow, thickly armored tanks, from the Matilda to the Cromwell to the Churchill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something, or was this just a bad doctrine? Maybe it made since in the interwar and Phoney War phase, where the allies expected a more static, WWI-esque war, but after the war began in earnest, why did the British keep investing in infantry tanks? While the Matilda was a famous part of the desert war, from what I understand it was so slow it couldn&amp;#39;t keep up with the highly maneuverable nature of the North African campaign, and it seems like Shermans were just better in every regard, and is why the British and the French adopted them in such large numbers (in addition to there just being so many). But why did they keep building and designing new bulky, slow infantry tanks, rather than investing earlier in a medium tank with higher speed and bigger guns?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it seems like post-war history also supports the idea that infantry tanks were just a bad bet, because after the war every adopted the American and Soviet medium-tank model, with the &amp;quot;main battle tank&amp;quot; being the, well, main feature of tanks, including the British Centurion and onward. Even Germany&amp;#39;s heavy tank doctrine had its merits, and had a big influence on later tanks, but it really seems like infantry tanks were just a plain old mistake, and no part of tank history onwards made any use of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
