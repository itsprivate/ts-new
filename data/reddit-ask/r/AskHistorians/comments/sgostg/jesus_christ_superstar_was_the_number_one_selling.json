  "title": "\"Jesus Christ Superstar\" was the number one selling album in 1971. It is an anomaly among best-selling albums of that year, and outperformed many progressive rock albums that are better-regarded today. How did this album become a commercial success *before* the premier of the musical?",

  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, it&amp;#39;s a weird album, even for its time. It was the best-selling album of the year, and Billboard&amp;#39;s #1 album; among other hit albums, it&amp;#39;s fairly unique. The Contemporary Christian Music scene hadn&amp;#39;t really taken off yet at that time. Progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and Genesis would release albums around this time that didn&amp;#39;t reach gold until years later; Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, and Deep Purple would have releases with similar sales numbers, that didn&amp;#39;t chart nearly as high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &amp;#39;Jesus Christ Superstar&amp;#39; was considered a long-shot when it was recorded. Weber and Rice released the album because they were unsuccessful in producing it into a stage show. However, the album became a huge success, even before it earned the name-recognition of the popular show. All-in-all, it seems like a real underdog. Why did this particular album see more success than other stylistically similar albums, and how did it become a pop hit from out of the stylistic left-field?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
