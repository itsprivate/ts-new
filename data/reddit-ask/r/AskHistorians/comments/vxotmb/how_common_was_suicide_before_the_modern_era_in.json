I also remember that in the BBC series Rome suicide was a more common occurrence/topic. I am aware that these drama series are not exactly historic sources, but in my laymen historic education I also remember stumbling over suicide multiple times in real historic sources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Christianity suicide is for the most part considered a sin, but it still happened. Is it possible to say if there was a difference in occurrence of suicide between the pre-christian Europe and the christianised one? Was suicide seen as an accepted escape of lifes misery in ancient times? And was it still accepted in Christian lands as an, even if sinfull, still honourable way out? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our modern times the number of conducted suicides by men massively outweighs that of women. Was there a similar gender difference in other time periods?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much did the common people know about suicide? Was it a occurrence that happened in most bigger settlements on a regular basis or did it stay a very rare occurrence? Did people even have a general idea how to end their life effectively if they decided to do so?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember for example one episode in the German history in which young people copied the suicide of the protagonist in Goethe&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;The Sorrows of the Young Werther&amp;#39;. It seems that they were before either not aware of this &amp;#39;possibility&amp;#39; or felt morally justified by copying a loved fictional character.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
