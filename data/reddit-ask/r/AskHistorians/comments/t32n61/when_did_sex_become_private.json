Was it because of shame? How was privacy thought of in early and middle history? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only other contrasting scene coming to mind was the rape/sex in the dothraki tribe in game of thrones which was in public view of others or open space. I know that’s fictional but given other large mammals mate in full view of others, how did humans evolve to have sex in private? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
