The fact that these claims are still taught in modern schools and believed by a significant portion of the US population is quite surprising considering that the USA is viewed as a developed country and has many leading universities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For comparison, in India (which is more religious than the USA), all schools that are recognised by the government have to use a scientifically sound non-religious educational curriculum created by either a state-level or a national-level authority (or the curriculum has to be an international one that is recognised by other Indian educational institutions, like IGCSE or the International Baccalaureate). If an Indian school is run by a religious organisation (most such schools are run by Catholic organisations or Hindu organisations), they can hold daily prayers and other religious activities, but they don&amp;#39;t usually try to guilt people using their religion and they almost never teach anything that contradicts science. Plus, &lt;a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/trust-science-india-pew-research-center/\"&gt;Indians in general have more trust in scientists compared to Americans&lt;/a&gt; though of course &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha_drinking_milk_miracle\"&gt;we have out fair share of religious people who believe in miracles&lt;/a&gt;. So I don&amp;#39;t see why being more religious should make someone not believe in scientific theories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, how did America get a significant Christian population that doesn&amp;#39;t believe in many commonly accepted scientific theories?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
