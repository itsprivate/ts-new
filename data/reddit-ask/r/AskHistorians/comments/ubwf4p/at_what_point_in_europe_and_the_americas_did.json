But a rodent in the house is something that needs to be more or less immediately dealt with, possibly by an expensive professional depending on the severity, local health concerns (my region of the U.S. is home to hantaviruses and the plague), and homeowner&amp;#39;s proclivities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I imagine this wasn&amp;#39;t always the case and one point rodents in the home could be expected as normal part of life, even if never exactly desirable (like how most people don&amp;#39;t freak out or even care if a moth is fluttering around, especially if they don&amp;#39;t have any fur or cashmere clothes). So when did that change? And does it have any relation to public awareness of modern germ theory or were they separate developments?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
