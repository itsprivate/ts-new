Why were they so afraid of being unethical? Surely virtuous actions would serve fellow citizens in a civilized society, but why did they think it mattered if they didn&amp;#39;t believe in an explicitly rewarding/punishing afterlife such as heaven/hell in the midst of reason? Why not then indulge and be unethical if the result is non-existence in death?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
