There are countless gnostic &amp;quot;gospels&amp;quot; and Gnostic belief systems seem to have survived well into the middle ages. The closest thing I can think of to a significant gnostic religion that exists today is Christian Science, but it lacks a historical bond to ancient gnosticism, and doesn&amp;#39;t include many of the same core concepts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it just a quirk of history that Constantine adopted what became &amp;quot;mainstream&amp;quot; Christianity and enforced its message across the Roman Empire? Would it have been plausible for him to have adopted a more gnostic form of Christianity, or had gnosticism already fallen out of favor by then among mainstream Church authorities?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
