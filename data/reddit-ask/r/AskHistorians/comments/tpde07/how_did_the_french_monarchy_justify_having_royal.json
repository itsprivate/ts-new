But it does strike me as odd that they could have Royal Mistresses be officially acknowledged. Once you have royal mistress as an official position it seems to me you are basically keeping a royal harem. How was this officially justified? Did the position of Maîtresse-en-titre involve less scandalous official duties? Did the whole thing ever get condemned by the more religious? Wasn&amp;#39;t it seen as a problem for the King to be living in officially acknowledged sin?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
