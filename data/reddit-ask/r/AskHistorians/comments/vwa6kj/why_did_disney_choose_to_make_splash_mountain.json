The attraction is based off of an old and relatively obscure Disney movie named &amp;quot;Song of the South. The movie is widely considered one of the most racist films Disney has ever released, which is exactly why they are changing Splash Mountain&amp;#39;s name to &amp;quot;Tiana&amp;#39;s Bayou Adventure&amp;quot; in 2024 within the theme parks. However, one is to ask why Splash Mountain was even made in the first place. Ever since the Civil Rights Era, Disney has tried to erase the movie from its history entirely, which is why the movie has no VHS version and hasn&amp;#39;t been released in theaters since 1986, which predated Splash Mountain by 3 years. With this in mind, it is puzzling to me as to why Disney has decided to make an attraction in their theme parks based off of this movie in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this in mind. why did Disney make a theme park attraction based off of a highly controversial movie that they&amp;#39;ve been trying to remove all traces of for the past 60 years?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
