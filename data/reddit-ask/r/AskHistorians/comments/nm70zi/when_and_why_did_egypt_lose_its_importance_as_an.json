As a matter of fact, as I understand it, the land of the Nile started to focus more and more on cash crops like cotton instead of grain.</p>\n\n<p>So why did Egypt lose its preeminence as major exporter of grain? Were other regions productive enough to meet Europe&#39;s market demands, even though they had a shorter growing season (but perhaps very fertile soil)? Was it because Europe&#39;s population boomed throughout this period, and so the arable land of Egypt became relatively small?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
