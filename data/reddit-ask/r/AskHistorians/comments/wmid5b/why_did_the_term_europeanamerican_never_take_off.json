There was a groundswell of support for the term among the Black community, legitimizing it as an acceptable term. Since then, the term has been criticized for various reasons but is still generally accepted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In contrast, European-American never gained traction. The only evidence I could find of the consideration of its usage was a 1995 survey by the Office of Management and Budget that asked self-identified white people which term they prefer. The term “White” won with a majority, and &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111212044012/http://www.bls.census.gov/cps/pub/ethnic_0595.htm\"&gt;only 2.35%&lt;/a&gt; selected “European-American”. I’m not surprised by this result for the general society, but I’m surprised that in the 80s the term didn’t even gain traction within academic or progressive circles. Does anyone know why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
