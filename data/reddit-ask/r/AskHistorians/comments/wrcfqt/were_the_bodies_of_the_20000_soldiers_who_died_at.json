Surely 20,000 bodies can’t have disappeared to the extent that only two have been found? And the sugar thing sounds just too gruesome to be credible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the fact it’s exclusively reported in the Daily Mail rather than, say, somewhere that historians typically publish research makes me question its accuracy, but maybe I’m just being a snob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there any truth to any of this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
