One that I have seen recently stated that\nRussia/Soviet Union invented the first military alliance used not to fight with an enemy but to invade and control its members. The second part of the claim is true - the only military action of the Warsaw Pact was the invasion of Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, the Brezhnev Doctrine made this intent clear and explicit, and the communist government of Poland justified the introduction of martial law with the threat of invasion by allied forces to reestablish &amp;quot;stability&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, is it true that this was the first example of such a multi-nation alliance? Are there any other examples in history of a military alliance that never fought against an external enemy but instead was used primarily to bully its members?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
