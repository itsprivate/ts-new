I just finished reading Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Double&lt;/em&gt;, and met yet another Titular councilor who works as a copier for a government ministry. This seems especially interesting to me considering the vast majority of the Russian population was illiterate at the time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a very common trope in Russian literature. Two other examples that come to mind are the protagonist in Gogol&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Overcoat&lt;/em&gt; and the protagonist in Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Poor Folk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;vibe&amp;quot; the reader gets from these stories is that the copying itself isn&amp;#39;t all that important -- it seems like busy work. While I&amp;#39;m sure some of this is for effect (the poor, sad bureaucrat with a meaningless existence) but I imagine it must be based at least partially on reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my question is: What are they copying, and why are these characters so prevalent in Russian lit? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
