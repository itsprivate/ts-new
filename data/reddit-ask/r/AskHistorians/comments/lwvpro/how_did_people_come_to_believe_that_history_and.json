So they think that the progression of technology is almost preordained, and things like AI, space travel, and climate change are both necessary and unavoidable. It&#39;s like a historical or technological determinism. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, I can&#39;t imagine that this is right, not only because it&#39;s so locked into a Westernized understanding of progress (they always talk about printing press -&gt; factory -&gt; industrial age, etc.), but also because it&#39;s ignoring that technologies are designed for specific purposes - for instance, the industrial factory of the 19th century isn&#39;t an &quot;inevitability,&quot; it&#39;s a specific tool designed to create/collect resources in a system that has arbitrary and culturally-specific systems for allocating resources. It&#39;s not inevitable, it&#39;s a product of its environment. </p>\n\n<p>But people still seem to think that history is marching toward some predetermined technological horizon. </p>\n\n<p>Where did that idea come from? What do historians call it? </p>\n\n<p>If someone could even just point me to the <em>name</em> of this belief system, that would be great. I&#39;ve read the Stanford summary of the idea of progress, but that&#39;s not super helpful - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s what I&#39;m describing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
