Yet, every info on him seems to be taken specifically from Journey to the West, I haven&amp;#39;t found any story about him that predates the book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a situation like with some greek characters like Odysseus, where, Homer didn&amp;#39;t invent the character, the Odyssey is simply recounting already existing myths about him? (At least, that&amp;#39;s what I understand about the Odyssey, If I&amp;#39;m wrong about this, please let me know)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I&amp;#39;m not asking whether Sun Wukong has similar textual predecessors, like other legendary monkeys that Wu Cheng&amp;#39;en might have drawn from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m asking whether a Chinese man in 1592 would pick up the hot new NYT bestseller and think &amp;quot;Oh, Sun Wukong, yes I know that guy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if he did, what would he know of him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
