Apparently the son of a British officer who was stationed in Calcutta also remembered his father talking about three surviving escapees arriving in 1942, but had no documentation of any kind. And finally, an author named &amp;quot;Linda Willis did a decade of research on most parts of the story, without reaching a definite conclusion, but cleared up some details.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a muddle! What&amp;#39;s true, and what&amp;#39;s not? Or to put it another way, is there any evidence at all for Rawicz&amp;#39; story beyond his word?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
