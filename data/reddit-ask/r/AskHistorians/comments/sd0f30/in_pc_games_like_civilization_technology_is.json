Certainly, often it does seem to fit historic reality well, e.g., writing was invented and pretty much stayed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other times it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to fit at all, e.g., aqueducts in ancient Rome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my question comes down to the permanence of ideas. Is it a valid abstraction to assume that once an idea has been established , it stays? E.g., get some &amp;quot;researcher points&amp;quot; and invent &amp;quot;chariots&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or is it much more historically accurate to abstract to a maintenance model, e.g., we need to produce at least 5 &amp;quot;research points&amp;quot; to keep &amp;quot;chariots&amp;quot; after inventing it or else we&amp;#39;ll lose it after X rounds/years?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
