It is my hope that everyone reading this will be as enchanted by these stories as I am.</p>\n\n<p>I’d like to thank everyone who submitted a piece for this mosaic of stories. This has truly been wonderful and I have loved reading everything that everyone has put together. And finally, a big thank you to the entire AskHistorians community, who without we’d simply be yelling into the void.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, without further ado, here are the pieces.
