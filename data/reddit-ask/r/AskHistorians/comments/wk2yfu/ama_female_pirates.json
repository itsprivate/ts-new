I completed my PhD in 2017 at King’s College London where I researched public executions of pirates. I just published a new book called &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pirate-Queens-Lives-Anne-Bonny/dp/1526791307/ref=nodl_\"&gt;Pirate Queens: The Lives of Anne Bonny &amp;amp; Mary Read.&lt;/a&gt; The book is a biography about them along with a study of gender, sexuality, and myth as it relates to the sea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll be online between 10:00 - 1:00 EDT. I’m excited to answer any questions about female pirates, maritime history, and pirates! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about me at my &lt;a href=\"https://rebecca-simon.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. \nTwitter: @beckex\nTikTok: @piratebeckalex &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also check out my &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k04tmz/ama_the_golden_age_of_piracy/\"&gt;previous AMA&lt;/a&gt; I did in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
