I do not mean feminizing a male name like Robert to Roberta, but a name being given to the other sex while unchanged. For example, the names Leslie,  Ashley, Madison &amp;quot;Maddie&amp;quot;,  Sydney, and Shannon all used to be solidly male names but today are solidly/ mostly female. Superficially, it seems like the male versions were at least reasonably common and thus understood to be male. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, why only those names? People had more rigid gender norms and the first girls named Ashley would have been seen like somebody naming their daughter David or Matthew today, right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I know some Catholics give boys feminine middle names like &amp;quot;Maria&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;m talking about aggressively gender swapping some number of first/ given names.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
