The implied value of New York in this retelling turns out to be its location: it has natural harbors and was smack dab in the middle of all the European coastal colonies, so it&amp;#39;s great for trade, and in fact goes on to become the financial capital of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how much of this value is also due to scale? That is, the fact that once it was incorporated into the British Empire, it benefits from access to friendly neighbors and collective infrastructure. Would New Amsterdam ever have had anything close to the same amount of value if it remained a small Dutch island surrounded by the English? Or would the Dutch Empire have found itself in a Portugal situation, sinking money into supporting unsustainable and unprofitable colonies that eventually succumb to bankruptcy, rebellion, or conquest?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: just realized that this post is framed as kind of an alternate history question, which is really unanswerable, and also in the long run almost every European colony achieved independence one way or another. So to put it a different way: at the time of the transfer, did leaders of either the British or the Dutch openly acknowledge that in the long run, Manhattan could be valuable for the British, but not for the Dutch?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
