While this is the case, I also felt that the selection of books for the region of South Asia/the Indian Subcontinent can be considerably expanded considering the sheer amount of historical material available regarding the region and the absence of more sub-regional histories in the list, considering that many of these sub-regions such as Bengal, Punjab, the Indo-Gangetic plain, Tamil country and so on are comparable to, or are significantly larger then, many similar European countries or regions. While it could be argued that more specialised sub-regional histories can be covered through questions and answers in the sub, the sad reality is that a lot of questions regarding South Asia/ the Subcontinent remained unanswered for long with the posts eventually getting locked, leaving a noticeable gap on content regarding a very large part of world history. I speak of this region because I am most familiar with it, it is likely that similar expansions for other regions in the world can be done as well. Plus its anyway been a while since the list has been updated. Again, I must emphasise that this is not a critique as such of the current booklist as even in its current form it has been a tremendous source of knowledge for me regarding regions I knew previously very little about, this is just a suggested means of expansion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
