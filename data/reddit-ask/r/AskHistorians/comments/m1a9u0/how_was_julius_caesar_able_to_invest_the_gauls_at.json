How did Caesar’s men simultaneously contain the Gauls and complete this Herculean building project which must have badly depleted their available fighting strength? Where did they get the massive quantities of tools, nails, ropes, and other supplies necessary for the task? I’ve heard that Roman camps were sometimes prefabricated and moved from site to site; did Caesar do something similar here?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
