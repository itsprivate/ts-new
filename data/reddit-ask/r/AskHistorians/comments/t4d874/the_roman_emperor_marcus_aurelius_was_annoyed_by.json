What would be the point? Having such a mouth and such armpits, there’s going to be a smell emanating. You say, they must have sense, can’t they tell how they are offending others? Well, you have sense too, congratulations! So, use your natural reason to awaken theirs, show them, call it out. If the person will listen, you will have cured them without useless anger. No drama nor unseemly show required.”&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MARCUS AURELIUS,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;MEDITATIONS&lt;/em&gt;, 5.28&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware that Marcus was a Stoic, and the reframing of his annoyance above was a way of coming to terms with things he couldn&amp;#39;t control and refocusing on what he could — either telling people they stank so they could address it, or shutting up and accepting that sometimes armpits just stink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m friends with a few people who are all about natural living. That means no deodorant, and perhaps questionable bathing habits. They often have a notably unpleasant reek. I&amp;#39;ve heard the au naturel crowd claim that people have always had BO, and it&amp;#39;s only modern people who are perturbed by it and try to reign it in through bathing and deodorants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But is that true? How common was dislike of BO? Did people just get used to it, or was it always annoying?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the premodern era, did people bath to address BO? Did they have any other remedies? Is dislike of BO really a mostly modern thing, with outliers like the rich Marcus Aurelius representing a snobbish view?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just what did Marcus expect his subjects to do once informed of their stinkiness? Just take a bath? Something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
