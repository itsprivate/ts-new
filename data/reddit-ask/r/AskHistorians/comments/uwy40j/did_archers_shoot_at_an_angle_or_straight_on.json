He was saying the force of impact, especially with large arrows which lose momentum fast, is much better straight on, and arched shots are more likely to glance off armor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the video: &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/v0Xwx12ekSU\"&gt;https://youtu.be/v0Xwx12ekSU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also know the idea of firing in volleys is a myth, based on firearm warfare and propagated back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is... was this true for basically all pre-firearm warfare? Were archers almost always firing head on at a shorter range? Are all the movies and Total War games in which archers engage from a distance with giant arched shots based on a misconception?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, we know little of actual warfare tactics besides on the macro level. Do we know how archers in... say, the Greek and Roman eras... actually fought? Nearly all the ancient depictions of archers in warfare I&amp;#39;ve seen, regardless of the era, feature them shooting straight ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the deal?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
