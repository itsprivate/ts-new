No one could afford to buy it and the store would end up with product that just goes bad and they have to toss until they shut down,  right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do prices tend to adjust? What has the impact been to average people in the past and what sorts of things were they unable to buy vs what things remain available?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Curious how that&amp;#39;s worked in the past and if we should expect the same or if modern commerce is so different it wouldn&amp;#39;t be relevant?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
