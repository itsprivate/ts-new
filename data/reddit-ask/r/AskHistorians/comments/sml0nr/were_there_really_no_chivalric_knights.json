The chivalric code is a sham!&amp;quot;, but is that really so?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recall many a moon ago I was looking into the issue and found some online resources talking about how while the idea of the chivalric knight wasn&amp;#39;t fitting of the early medieval ages, the later medieval ages ended up inspired by their own PR with many adopting such a romanticised code of honours as inspired by old tales. But I now that I&amp;#39;m older, I can&amp;#39;t seem to find them anymore and I&amp;#39;m starting to question the validity of the sources I found back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A helpful anon suggested I may have been thinking of the Courts of Love, but I&amp;#39;m unsure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone shed some light on the progressing relationship between knights and a code of honor, and/or perhaps provide from resources that I can look into? Thank you very much in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
