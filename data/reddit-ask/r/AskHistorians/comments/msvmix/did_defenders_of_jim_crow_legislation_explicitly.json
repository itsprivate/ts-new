They typically enacted disenfranchisement indirectly by targeting ostensibly non-racial traits like literacy or the ability to pay a tax. I have to assume that this workaround was for the purpose of avoiding the 15th amendment, which seems to forbid explicit disenfranchisement by race.</p>\n\n<p>This made me wonder: when people defended Jim Crow voting laws, what did they say? Did Southern politicians directly acknowledge that it was targeting black people, or did they feel compelled to use other excuses in their rhetoric? And if they did use other excuses, did any of the public actually buy into it, or was it largely recognized that it was all about race?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
