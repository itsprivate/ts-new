From what i have been taught in school is that the Natives in the midwest were nomadic peoples who lived in teepees and moved wherever food was around the plains. But this region of the US is prone to tornadoes in the summer and heavy snow in the winter? This question doesn&#39;t just have to be about plains Native groups. Did they stay where they were and hope for the best? Or try to get away from the natural event that was before them?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
