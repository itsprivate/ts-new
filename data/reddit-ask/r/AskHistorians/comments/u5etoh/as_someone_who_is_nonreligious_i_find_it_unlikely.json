  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long title. Also, I’m not trying to talk down on anyone’s religious beliefs. If you believe that Jesus really was resurrected, I won’t argue with you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I want to explore an alternate view. My understanding is that the consensus among historians is that Jesus was a real person, who probably had some teachings that challenged the religious establishment at that time, and was probably put to death at some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what happens after? If Jesus dies and stays dead, how/why do so many people become part of this explosive new religion, under the impression that he was indeed raised up? Was it a coordinated lie/coverup? By who? The apostles? If they were real, it had to have been them, because they wouldn’t have been fooled by a lookalike or by tall tales. But then, why would they subject themselves to the kind of persecution and martyrdom that was common in the early days of Christianity over something they knew they made up? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This leads me to a lot of other questions. As far as I know from my Christian upbringing, when it comes to authors of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, James, Jude and Peter all supposedly knew Jesus intimately for years. Paul never met him but was a contemporary of the other seven. But &lt;em&gt;is that true&lt;/em&gt;? Is there any historical or archaeological reason to believe that they really existed and wrote the gospels?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, I’m sorry for the length. I know I’ve probably asked a very controversial question. I have probably asked a lot of additional questions that merit a response of their own. But if someone could at least point me in the right direction, I would be very grateful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
