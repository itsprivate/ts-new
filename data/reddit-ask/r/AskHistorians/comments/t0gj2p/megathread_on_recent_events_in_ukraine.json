However, this is a crisis with important historical contexts, and we’ve already seen a surge of questions from users seeking to better understand what is unfolding in historical terms. Particularly given the disinformation campaigns that have characterised events so far, and the (mis)use of history to inform and justify decision-making, we understand the desire to access reliable information on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread will serve to collate all historical questions directly or indirectly to events in Ukraine. Our panel of flairs will do their best to respond to these questions as they come in, though please have understanding both in terms of the time they have, and the extent to which we have all been affected by what is happening. Please note as well that our usual rules about scope (particularly the 20 Year Rule) and civility still apply, and will be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
