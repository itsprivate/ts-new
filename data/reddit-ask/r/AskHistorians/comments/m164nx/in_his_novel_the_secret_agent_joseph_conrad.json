And this was strange, since the Italian restaurant is such a peculiarly British institution.  But these people were as denationalised as the dishes set before them with every circumstance of unstamped respectability.  Neither was their personality stamped in any way, professionally, socially or racially.  They seemed created for the Italian restaurant, unless the Italian restaurant had been perchance created for them.  But that last hypothesis was unthinkable, since one could not place them anywhere outside those special establishments.  One never met these enigmatical persons elsewhere.  It was impossible to form a precise idea what occupations they followed by day and where they went to bed at night.  And he himself had become unplaced.  It would have been impossible for anybody to guess his occupation.  As to going to bed, there was a doubt even in his own mind.  Not indeed in regard to his domicile itself, but very much so in respect of the time when he would be able to return there.  A pleasurable feeling of independence possessed him when he heard the glass doors swing to behind his back with a sort of imperfect baffled thud.  He advanced at once into an immensity of greasy slime and damp plaster interspersed with lamps, and enveloped, oppressed, penetrated, choked, and suffocated by the blackness of a wet London night, which is composed of soot and drops of water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
