We&amp;#39;re raising the red cross for this week&amp;#39;s trivia. This week is dedicated to those who were harmed or killed during an event - those known as casualties. This is the week to share details about shocking statistics or how those statistics are gathered. Perhaps you know interesting trivia on how aid is rendered to those harmed during an event or inventions that came out to better save lives. Let this week be the place to render aid to our understanding of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
