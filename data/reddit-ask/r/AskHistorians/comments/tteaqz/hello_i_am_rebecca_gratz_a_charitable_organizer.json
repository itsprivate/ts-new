My parents raised us to be devout Jews, but also gave us excellent educations, and my father&amp;#39;s income allowed us to mingle with society. As such, while only an amateur poet myself, in my youth I was fortunate enough to meet and maintain correspondences with leading writers and poets of my day both in America and England. While they were amiable and the dearest of friends, I knew that I had to allay their instincts to assure me of the superiority of the Christian faith, and to demonstrate that the Jewish religion is worthy of respect. While I never met Sir Walter Scott, it&amp;#39;s been said that Scott heard of me and based the character of Rebecca in Ivanhoe, the first positive portrayal of a Jew in English fiction, on me. If that is true, what an honor it is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had an overall pleasant youth, though I never did find a man who would be an agreeable domestic companion given my strong will. I have over the years spent much time caring for ill family members and my siblings&amp;#39; children, which I confess to find a trying thing. However, the charitable instincts instilled in me by my dear mother allows me to bear it and also led me toward the vocation in which I&amp;#39;ve spent the latter part of my life- charity work and teaching. After beginning as secretary of several Christian charity organizations in Philadelphia, I, along with my mother and some of my sisters, helped to found the Female Association for the Relief of Women and Children in Reduced Circumstances, which aids indigent women and children of all faiths, as well as the Philadelphia Orphan Asylum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In recent years,  I have felt that the Jewish community of Philadelphia needs its own charitable organizations, and so I started the  Female Hebrew Benevolent Society, which I am told is the first American Jewish charitable organization unaffiliated with a synagogue and which works to provide women with discreet help in a variety of areas. I then saw that Jewish children lacked knowledge of their heritage, a shocking development, and so founded the Hebrew Sunday School, which I am pleased to report has become a success and has led to my being able to instruct other Jewish communities in establishing their own Sunday Schools. Most recently, the Jewish Foster Home has become a focus of my attentions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The picture of me above is an old one- from my youth, when I was painted by several fashionable portraitists. While my appearance now may bear signs of my advancing age, I still feel the very resoluteness that I believe that painting conveys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please ask me anything about my life, Philadelphia, the Jewish community, or anything you desire!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I have returned, and hope to continue to answer your queries until the start of the Sabbath!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
