He was very chearful, and when he met with anything interesting or entertaini[n]g, he read it aloud as well as his hoarseness would permit him. He requested me to read to him the debates of the Virginia Assembly on the election of a Senator and a Governor; and on hearing Mr Madison’s observations respecting Mr Monroe, he appeared much affected and spoke with some degree of asperity on the subject; which I endeavoured to moderate, as I always did on such occasions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly he read about the Virginia Assembly, but what newspapers would have been readily available at Mount Vernon in December 1799, and what &amp;quot;interesting or entertaining&amp;quot; things could Washington have been reading aloud?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A separate, but related follow-up question. Since Lear obviously stayed into the evening, did he currently reside inside the Mount Vernon mansion when Washington died? If so, is it known &lt;a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/the-estate-gardens/the-mansion/the-mansion-room-by-room/\"&gt;which bedroom was his?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
