Despite being three quarters white, they were still enslaved and even sold. Does that mean you could look basically white and still be a slave in the Antebellum South? Could they say &amp;quot;Sorry, I know you have blond hair, blue eyes, and skin paler than the moon but one of your great, great grandparents was black so you&amp;#39;re a slave.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
