Fitzwilliam, who was a great friend of his mother&amp;#39;s.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Darcy is a man of vast independent means, and it is made clear that while Lady De Burgh wants him to marry her daughter, he has absolutely no interest in the match. It is also made clear that he has a very low opinion of Lady De Burgh herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To a modern reader, it seems odd that he should spend such a long time visiting someone for whom he has no personal affection, nor any expectation of material advancement: Lady De Burgh can give him absolutely nothing which he needs or wants. And I don&amp;#39;t think it is suggested in the text that he contrived the visit simply because Ms Bennett would be there, or that he was even aware of that fact?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Presumably to a contemporary reader, the visit is not an odd one though. Would visiting family friends for this length of time have been common for someone of Mr Darcy&amp;#39;s class? Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Mods I&amp;#39;m sorry I added the wrong flair and now seem unable to change it myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
