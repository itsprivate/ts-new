I mean, literally. Because, at one point, there was only one book. Like, as far as our Western culture is concerned, there was one book. And, for a while, literally, there was only one book, and that book was the Bible, and then, before it was the Bible, it was scrolls and writings on papyrus, but we were starting to aggregate written text together. And it went through all sorts of technological transformations, and then it became books that everybody could buy -- the book  everybody could buy -- and the first one of those was the Bible. And then became all sorts of books that everybody could buy, but all those books, in some sense, emerged out of that underlying book, and that book itself -- the Bible isn&amp;#39;t a book; it&amp;#39;s a library. It&amp;#39;s a collection of books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this true at all? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;m a fan of neither Rogan nor Peterson. I&amp;#39;m only interested in fact-checking this seemingly falsifiable statement.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
