Mexico was essentially a one-party state. Such party surprisingly lasted MORE than the Soviet Communist Party in power. Some reforms in the 90s allowed for other parties to win local elections, until the year 2000 when, for the first time in more than 70 years, the PRI party DID NOT win. And even BEFORE the civil war and PRI, the winner was always dictator Porfirio Diaz&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to people who were alive and have memories of such moment, it was comparable to the fall of the Berlin Wall (although waaaaay less important in the global stage)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In mexican history it was a before and after moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying &amp;quot;no one cared&amp;quot; outside of Mexico would be a valid and expected answer tho. But I am curious as to other nations like the US reacted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that time, it was more or less a rule that the current mexican president (pri) would choose the next PRI candidate, essentially the president choosing his successor. This tradition was known as &amp;quot;Dedazo&amp;quot; (big finger). PRI &amp;quot;primaries&amp;quot; were esentially a contest to gain the current presidet&amp;#39;s favour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Mexican_general_election\"&gt;2000 Mexican general election - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_Revolutionary_Party\"&gt;Institutional Revolutionary Party - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
