I’ve run into references of “green bacon” for a dish I’m quite tickled to re-create. After looking up this green bacon I’ve found a couple recipes on it but I’d like to make sure this is the same Green Bacon referred to in Digbys writings as he lived during the early half of the 1600s and it goes without saying that’s a long time ago. Any culinary Historians able to shed some insight on if I’m looking in the right place? Thanks! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And -before I get asked- I currently refer to project Gutenberg for all my old recipes!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
