  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;#39;ve been wondering about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In American movies, set in times ranging from early colonist times , revolutionary war, civil war, westerns,... plenty of rural villages are featured but as far as I know there&amp;#39;s never a windmill.&lt;br/&gt;\nEven remote mining villages in a desert would need a way to grind wheat as flour only keeps well for a few days/weeks and must be made locally.   They were also used to crush oats, oil, malt,... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the Americas were colonized by Europeans, one would expect they&amp;#39;d bring wind mills with them. Especially since there was a lot of rural activity going on.&lt;br/&gt;\nPost mills are essentially portable and were moved and reassembled regularly in Europe (even today), it would have been easy to build and ship them over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did see some references of the English shipping windmills across the Atlantic.  And the Dutch built some windmills in their colonies.    But other than that there pretty much aren&amp;#39;t many references of windmills in the US or Canada.   (Or Mexico as Spain also had windmills) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if this is a true representation of early America? If so, how did people manage to grind wheat and corn?&lt;br/&gt;\nI know water mills exist, but these aren&amp;#39;t feasible in many locations as you need water and some elevation.&lt;br/&gt;\nThere&amp;#39;s also horse mills but these were mostly used (here in Belgium) in big city centers or as a sort of back-up when there was no wind for extended periods.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I love Breughel the elder, &lt;a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Jan_Brueghel_I_-_Landscape_with_windmills_-_M.Ob.1060_-_National_Museum_in_Warsaw.jpg\"&gt;this is his depiction of 16th century countryside&lt;/a&gt; , knowing most villages here in Belgium had one or more wind mills it probably not too far from the truth. Granted, this is the low countries, but I assume the Americas also have flat plains and deltas that look similar to the low countries.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
