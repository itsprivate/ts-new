Something that these videos usually account for is the different measurement systems and kitchen terminology between American and British audiences - cups vs ml, grill vs broiler, etc. But when dealing with cuts of meat, I&amp;#39;ve seen there&amp;#39;s also a difference between American and British butchery terms - &lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v1kwoml4lg5z.jpg?auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1f73d961dc829e84f939bf4ec02beea41bf0eaab\"&gt;see this handy chart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can understand how languages can diverge over time, but I would think that butchery would be a more calcified institution - cows haven&amp;#39;t changed much since 1776! I would assume that American butchers imported British butchery (like they did with a British legal system and other professions) and something changed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When did American and British butchery traditions diverge? How does butchery compare to other professions that diverged?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
