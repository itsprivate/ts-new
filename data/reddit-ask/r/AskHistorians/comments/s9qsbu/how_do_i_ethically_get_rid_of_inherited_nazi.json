How do I ethically get rid of these items? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the most obvious answer would be to donate them to a museum, but I&amp;#39;m not sure the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for example, would be interested in accepting them due the mundane nature of the items. A lot of the pieces are furniture or furnishings with engraved Nazi symbols. Does anyone have any advice on how I can dispose of these items?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
