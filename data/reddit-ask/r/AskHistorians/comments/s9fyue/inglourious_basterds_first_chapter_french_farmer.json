  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first chapter of the movie Inglourious Basterds from 2009, SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa arrives at the dairy farm of Perrier LaPadite, searching for a Jewish family. He makes LaPadite confess that the family hides below the floorboards and his soldiers fire their entire magazine into the floor, killing the family except Shosanna. This is obviously added for some action and Shosanna&amp;#39;s plot armor, and not what would&amp;#39;ve really happened. Because why waste so many bullets, if you can force the family to stand in a line, killing them with a headshot? Why kill them right there at Monsier LaPadite&amp;#39;s farm? Also, Perrier LaPadite doesn&amp;#39;t seem to face any repercussions afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking: What would&amp;#39;ve actually happened?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 1941, northern, rural France. An SS-Standartenführer learns about a Jewish family hiding at Perrier LaPadite&amp;#39;s farm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Could the SS just go there and enter the house at their will? Or would they have to report this to someone higher up and get some kind of a warrant first? In case they needed warrants: What would the consequences be for an illegal search?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Would the SS simply go there in a small group? Would they be afraid of attacks from the locals or could they freely roam through France?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Would the SS really kill the Jews right there in front of the locals? My guess is, that they would detain them, trying to keep the illusion that the people are deported to some other place where they could live safely but outside the Reich (Madagascar?), while sending them to a concentration camp doing slave work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Assuming Perrier LaPadite is interested in international politics and reads the local newspapers: Would he have any knowledge about what would&amp;#39;ve happened to the Jewish family? My guess is, that local newspapers would&amp;#39;ve covered that Jews are detained, but could Perrier know about concentration and extermination camps at this point?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- What would&amp;#39;ve happened to Monsier LaPadite? Would this be considered a crime and if yes, who would judge him: a Nazi or a French judge?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
