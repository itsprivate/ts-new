So it seems natural that with so much wealth being shipped back and forth, piracy would have been a significant problem in the Indian Ocean. Yet I&amp;#39;ve never really seen Indian Ocean piracy mentioned unless it&amp;#39;s in connection to the colonial era or later, as if it suddenly appeared from nowhere in the 16th century. But what about in antiquity? How much of a problem were pirates in the Indian Ocean during the Roman era, and how much did it affect the Rome-India-China trade? Did the Romans have a naval fleet in the Red Sea to combat piracy? What about other countries around the ocean, in India, East Africa, Persia, Arabia, Southeast Asia? Did they have navies strong enough to keep piracy under control?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
