I’m not sure how familiar the AskHistorians community is with the popular sentiments of the rural folk here concerning the Civil War, but it’s basically one long badhistory thread writ large and played out irl. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve heard it all, from the popular “states’ rights” argument to the more obscure and far-fetched (and quite obviously propaganda/misinformation-fueled) appeals to southern chivalry and defense against culture decay. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest disconnect I’ve encountered, both as a student and as a private citizen, is how either side of the aisle gives a different, sweeping statement regarding southern military power. White supremacists and victims of revisionist propaganda tend to suggest that the South was militarily superior but lost due to a myriad of innane excuses and vague references to “logistics.” At the same time, non-apologists suggest that victory was inevitable but merely delayed by surprise victories early on in the war.</p>\n\n<p>So, given that history very very rarely boils down to such reductionist explanations, what is the truth behind this? Did the South stand a chance? Did the North ever stand to lose?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Interestingly enough, I’ve received two contradictory answers that both sound plausible! The very phenomenon I just described has played out among historians here in a more thought-out manner.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
