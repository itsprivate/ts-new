But as a historical perspective, how different is The 1619 Project compared to, say, what was taught to college undergraduates a decade ago, and is there legitimately nuanced debate and dissent to it within the historian community, or is this a case of finding the one dentist out of ten who doesn&amp;#39;t believe in toothpaste? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Senator Ted Cruz is obviously not a historian, and when he invokes the names of historians, I have no context for those people, either, so my first thought went to this subreddit, because news articles seem disinterested in the facts of history, compared to the conflict of modern political discourse surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance if this breaks the 20 year old rule, but my interpretation is that the 1619 project was a re-examination of the context of events which happened hundreds of years ago. So, for my questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is the context presented by the 1619 project different from the US history that I&amp;#39;m more familiar with in a broad-scope concept of US undergraduate historical education?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was the 1619 Project &amp;#39;roundly refuted&amp;#39; by collective historical academia, or if it&amp;#39;s more of a wedge issue where some adopt it and others don&amp;#39;t, or whether it&amp;#39;s generally an accurate framing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
