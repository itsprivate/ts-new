If so why would China send armies to India in 1000 BCE; and if not, then why did the authors insert them into the story?",

Can someone direct me to a sub about Asian history so I might contact some people who are motivated to answer? Thank you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for those who don&amp;#39;t know, &lt;em&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/em&gt; is an ancient Indian epic that&amp;#39;s sometimes called the eastern equivalent of &lt;em&gt;The Iliad&lt;/em&gt;. It tells of a great war fought thousands of years ago (scholars estimate around 1000 BCE) which would shape Indian religion, culture and history forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One very interesting tidbit I came across, but which doesn&amp;#39;t seem to get much discussion anywhere online or offline, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinas\"&gt;is the inclusion of a tribe called the Chinas.&lt;/a&gt; According to the writer of the epic, the Chinas were a nation whose territory is very far away and &amp;quot;can be reached by a land-route across the country of the Kiratas in the mountain regions of the north&amp;quot;. They are shown as sending large armies to fight in various battles during the story. But not much more is known about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wikipedia link, as well as other articles I&amp;#39;ve seen, believes this represents a Chinese dynasty. Can any historian here weigh in on whether there is any basis to this? It would be really interesting if Chinese militaries were invading India as far back as 1000 BCE, but that also raises the question of why - and in that case why don&amp;#39;t we hear more about Chinese-Indian political relations in ancient literature. And if China wasn&amp;#39;t a part of this at all, what reason would the author have to randomly include them among the nations listed?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
