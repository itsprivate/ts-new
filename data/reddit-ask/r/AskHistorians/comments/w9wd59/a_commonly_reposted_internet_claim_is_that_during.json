It says you can add &amp;quot;Benzoate of soda&amp;quot; (Today we would call it sodium benzoate) to prevent fermentation, but it doesn&amp;#39;t give the instructions which are obviously meant to encourage fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t find a single photo of one of these bricks with the claimed phrase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are of course images people have put together, like this one: &lt;a href=\"https://pics.me.me/source-is-mentioned-in-our-blog-www-unbelievablefactsblog-com-during-prohibition-grape-4225356.png\"&gt;https://pics.me.me/source-is-mentioned-in-our-blog-www-unbelievablefactsblog-com-during-prohibition-grape-4225356.png&lt;/a&gt; but obviously anyone can put that together in 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was the specific disclaimer about not leaving the grape juice to ferment a real thing? I don&amp;#39;t see why they would have both this disclaimer, AND the &amp;quot;add sodium benzoate&amp;quot; disclaimer to both avoid fermentation. Is it possible to debunk this? The ideal resolution to this would, of course, be to have a picture of the packaging of one of these bricks proving that it was real, but failing that, it would be nice if the origin of this myth could be identified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
