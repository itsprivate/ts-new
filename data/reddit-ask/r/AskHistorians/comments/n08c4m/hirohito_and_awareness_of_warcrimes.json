My question to you today is - Was Hirohito aware of the horrendous activities of his armies, such as rape and torture of prisoners? Its my understanding that he was allowed to remain emperor of Japan after the war partially because he seemed to be unaware of the extent of the heinous activities of his army. Is it really possible that the emperor was spared entirely of the grizzly details of human experimentation, slave labour, chemical weaponry, or ruthless pillaging which his own troops were inflicting on hundreds of thousands of people all over the theatre of war for over a decade? It seems like much of what was going on was public knowledge to people in Japan itself. Thanks for any answers on this - I&#39;m very intrigued by it. I feel like he should have been punished, but I understand that the allies wanted to use him to keep the peace in occupied Japan.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
