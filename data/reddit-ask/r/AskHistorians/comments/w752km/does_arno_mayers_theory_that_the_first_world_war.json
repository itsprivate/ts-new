Mayer rejected the traditional &lt;em&gt;Primat der Außenpolitik&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;quot;primacy of foreign politics&amp;quot;) argument of traditional diplomatic history on the grounds that it failed to take into account that in Mayer&amp;#39;s opinion, all of the major European countries were in a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_situation\"&gt;revolutionary situation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; during 1914, and thus ignores what Mayer considers to be the crucial effect that domestic politics had on foreign-policy making elites.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_J._Mayer#cite_note-Mayer_1996_43_44-4\"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; In Mayer&amp;#39;s opinion, during 1914, the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/a&gt; was on the verge of civil war and massive industrial unrest, Italy had been experienced the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Week_(Italy\"&gt;Red Week&lt;/a&gt;) of June 1914, the French Left and Right were almost warring with each other, Germany suffered from ever-increasing political strife, Russia was close to suffering a huge strike, and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt; was confronted with increasing ethnic and class tensions.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_J._Mayer#cite_note-Mayer_1996_45_46-5\"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; Mayer insists that &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism\"&gt;liberalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrist\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; ideologies in general were disintegrating due to the challenge from the extreme right in the UK, France and Italy while being a non-existent force in Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_J._Mayer#cite_note-Mayer_1996_46-6\"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; Mayer ended his essay by arguing that World War I should be best understood as a pre-emptive &amp;quot;counterrevolutionary&amp;quot; strike by ruling &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt; in Europe to preserve their power by distracting public attention to foreign affairs.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_J._Mayer#cite_note-Mayer_1996_47-7\"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a notion that other historians take seriously at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
