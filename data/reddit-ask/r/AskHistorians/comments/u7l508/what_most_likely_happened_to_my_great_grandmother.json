My Czech grandfather remembers being sick in bed with the measles at 8yo in about 1941, possibly in Brno. His mother was dragged out of the house and disappeared for 2 years. He has absolutely no idea why. He says she was a loving affectionate mother but she was cold and generally a completely different person when she returned. His father had already &amp;#39;disappeared&amp;#39; only to return years later, not sure why either. His mother was German and his father Czech and I believe his father may have been the mayor of the town at the time. He rambles and mind all over the place so it&amp;#39;s hard to pin point exact details. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
