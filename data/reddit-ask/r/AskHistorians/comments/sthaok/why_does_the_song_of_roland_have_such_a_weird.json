After punishing Ganelon, Charles the Great goes to sleep, and receives a mission from Gabriel - he is told to help out some random city besieged by the Saracens. Then he cries and complains about having so many responsibilities as a king.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talk about anti-climactic. Who would ever consider this a good idea, even in the 11th century? There must be some historical explanation, maybe the story is supposed to continue, or it was tradition to end on a weird note, or maybe we lost the ending.
