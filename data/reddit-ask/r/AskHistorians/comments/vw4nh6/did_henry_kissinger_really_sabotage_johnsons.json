Usually this supposed conspiracy also includes Nixon offering Kissinger a cabinet position in return for this service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure exactly where this accusation comes from, i haven’t been able to find much specific online but I’ve often seen it mentioned alongside Christopher Hitchens’ The Trial of Henry Kissinger, but not having read it I don’t know if Hitchens makes the accusation himself. Is there any truth to this claim, or any solid evidence to support the possibility?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
