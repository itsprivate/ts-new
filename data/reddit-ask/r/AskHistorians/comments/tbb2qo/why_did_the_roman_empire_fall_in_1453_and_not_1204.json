It seems to me that either the Empire of Nicaea WAS the Roman Empire; OR that the Roman Empire ceased to exist in 1204 and what came after was something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to explain my reasoning just in case it is not obvious where I am coming from:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We consider there to be 3 successor states to the Empire after 1204 (at least according to Wikipedia), which implies to me that all 3 had equal right to be considered the &amp;quot;Roman Empire&amp;quot;. One fell to Nicaea, so you could say that two reunited; but the Empire of Trebizond continued to exist past 1453. Why is Trebizond not the Roman Empire? Because Nicaea recaptured Constantinople? But if you &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hfrvox/the_byzantine_empire_was_referred_to_simply_as/\"&gt;don&amp;#39;t need Rome to be the Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, why do you need Constantinople?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What was restored in 1261, other than control of a city - did anything else meaningfully change or restore? Were the institutions of 1261 a meaningful continuation of the institutions of 1204, either with or without a break?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was the Empire after 1261 really an Empire, in the conventional sense? Did it control a multitude of nations and ethnic groups? Was it powerful?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
