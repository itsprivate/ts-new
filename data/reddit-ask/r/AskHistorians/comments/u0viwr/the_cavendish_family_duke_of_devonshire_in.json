They essentially became &amp;quot;foreign property&amp;quot; (for lack of a better word) for the English or British aristocrats who owned them. Since these aristocrats belonged to a system or legacy that was abolished by the Republic in Irish territory, why did the Irish Republic not confiscate these properties? Alternatively, did these aristocrats maintain ownership because the government gave them a new deed/title to the land issued by the Republic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if things are poorly worded. Hopefully I&amp;#39;m getting my question across!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
