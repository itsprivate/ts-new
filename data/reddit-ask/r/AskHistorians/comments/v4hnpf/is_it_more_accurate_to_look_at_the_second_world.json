It would seem coincidental that two separate but large conflicts would happen simultaneously. But on the other hand it seems from my inexperienced perspective that there isn&amp;#39;t really historical links that meant the events of one necessitated or acted as a catalyst for the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are they intrinsically linked? Or was it just coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
