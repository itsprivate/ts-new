Muslims still take issue with usury, in fact there is a whole subfield of banking called islamic banking dedicated to getting around this issue, and they have some pretty interesting if loopholely solutions. Because of this rule, banking in medieval Europe looked remarkably different to that of today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my question is this: Christains, like Muslims, used to take issue with usury or the charging of any interest on a loan. Why is this no longer the case? Why don&amp;#39;t Christains take issue with interest anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
