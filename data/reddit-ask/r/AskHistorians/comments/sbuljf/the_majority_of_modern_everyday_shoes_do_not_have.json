On the left is the Converse All Star, one of the most recognizable sneakers in the world. Right is Vivobarefoot Geo Court II. The shoe on the right&amp;#39;s silhouette looks a lot more like a foot to me, specifically the wide toebox. I put &amp;quot;natural foot&amp;quot; shape in quotes since that&amp;#39;s how the manufacturers advertise it, since I&amp;#39;m not really qualified to decide what is and is not a natural foot shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get this might fit better into &lt;a href=\"/r/AskFootScience\"&gt;r/AskFootScience&lt;/a&gt;, but the All Star has existed for over a hundred years, and a cursory look over shoes throughout history shows a lot of slim toeboxes. The premise of this question might also be incorrect in that I&amp;#39;m just missing all the wide toe box shoes that existed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
