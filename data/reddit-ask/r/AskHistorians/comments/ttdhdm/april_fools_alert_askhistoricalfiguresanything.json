This year we are doing  &lt;a href=\"/r/HistoricalAMA\"&gt;r/HistoricalAMA&lt;/a&gt;, inviting historical figures from throughout the centuries to answer questions from their legions of fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until 23:59, we are allowing AMA style submissions to be made by the &lt;em&gt;approved alt accounts&lt;/em&gt; of the Flaired Users of the subreddit, but are relaxing the rules for commenting (especially asking questions) in all threads with the &amp;#39;April Fools&amp;#39; Flair for all users. Please, ask the historical figures anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only rules in effect are those concerning civility, and as long as it is done in a joking manner towards the flaired alts, we even have some leeway there. Please just avoid racial, misogynistic, and other bigoted slurs, and please keep the questions relatively tasteful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to make your own alts to comment with, although we won&amp;#39;t be flairing them, but please &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; use them in April Fools threads. We will ban novelty accounts if they post in character elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Particularly for this event, we highly recommend saving threads that you find interesting and checking on them later after asking a question- all of our posters will be on their own schedules so they may not answer your questions right away, but they will do their best!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
