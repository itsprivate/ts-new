How were the logistics of this? If they went all down to the river and bathed themselves, and now they were wet, did they just put their same clothes on? Wouldn&#39;t that make them wet, uncomfortable, and most importantly, really cold?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve heard that the icelanders usually tried to bathe in hot springs, and the Finnish had saunas I think, but there aren&#39;t volcanoes all over the place to create hot springs, and afaik most people didn&#39;t go to saunas. So how did they keep warmth after taking a bath? Were there dedicated &quot;clothing&quot; such as towels for an event? Because that sounds a bit &quot;expensive&quot; (by that I mean, it&#39;s a lot of material for something you wouldn&#39;t use daily).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m meandering but I really want to understand how did these peoplee bathe without getting out of the water and being extremely cold.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
