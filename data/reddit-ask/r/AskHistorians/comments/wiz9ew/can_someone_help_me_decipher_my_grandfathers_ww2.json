My grandfather passed many years ago, but from what we understand we know was an aerial photographer during the war and he had to be in the nose of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s very interesting to me is that it mentions in the discharge paper that he got 6 bronze stars. Is that correct? I was reading about bronze stars and it says bronze stars are only issued for ground combat against enemy forces, not aerial. So does this mean he was on the ground as well? We do have old pictures he took of Hitler&amp;#39;s Eagles Nest, the European Theater of Operations were he was stationed, the &amp;#39;garage&amp;#39; where planes were kept and a bombed out Herman Goerings Home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to know if there is a way to find more info on his military experience, and learn WHY he got the medals he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
