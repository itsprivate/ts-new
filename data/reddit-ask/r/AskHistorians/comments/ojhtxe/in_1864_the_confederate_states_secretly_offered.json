But from the very start of the Civil War, slavery was one of the main obstacles to the Confederacy&#39;s efforts to secure diplomatic recognition from European powers.</p>\n\n<p>In 1864, as defeat was becoming more and more likely, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin agreed to send Duncan F. Kenner to Europe, to negotiate diplomatic recognition and material support from the UK and France in exchange for the abolition of slavery. Kenner&#39;s mission failed, partly because by the time he got to Europe the Confederacy&#39;s military situation had become truly hopeless (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4232057\">source</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Now for the question: if the Confederates had seceded in order to preserve slavery in the first place, why would they agree to abolish it to prevent their reabsorption into the Union? I haven&#39;t found any sources directly addressing this.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some hypotheses I have thought of:\n1. They feared that abolition on Northern terms would be less favourable than on their own terms (i.e. compensated vs uncompensated emancipation);\n2. They were afraid of Northern reconstruction (maybe they were fine with abolishing slavery but not with granting African Americans civil rights);\n3. Maybe they were concerned about personal (criminal) consequences for themselves;\n4. Maybe their stubbornness and sense of pride led them to take desperate measures to avoid defeat at all costs.</p>\n\n<p>But these are all conjectures of mine. Does anyone have a documented reason for why the Confederacy would abandon the very cause of its existence to secure its continued existence?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
