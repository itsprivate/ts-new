Since 2000, only groups have been honored. The most recent parade honored healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One could also argue that we&amp;#39;re finding fewer things worth throwing parades for, since the total number of celebrations has declined. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this represent NYC, or American society, becoming more collectivist? Is this society absorbing that the &amp;quot;great man&amp;quot; theory of history is bunk?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have there been fewer great achievements since we began landing men on the moon (parades were held for many astronauts)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe people just don&amp;#39;t like parades anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
