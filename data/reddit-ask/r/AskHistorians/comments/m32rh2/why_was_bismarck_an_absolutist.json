And throughout all his life, the royals would do nothing but fuck up his plans. Being sent off to Russia, having to scream at the King so he would understand the right political moves, and then finally being dismissed by Wilhelm and replaced.</p>\n\n<p>I would understand if he had some weird patriotic idea that was inherently tied with the monarchy during his younger years, but he mantained the same position all his life on this, while his entire political career was basically the universe screaming “LOOK, YOU SHOULDNT PUT SO MUCH POWER ON SOMEONE THAT COULD BE INCOMPETENT” on his face.</p>\n\n<p>So why exactly did he support absolutism? What was going throughout his mind to keep justifying this system that did nothing but screw him over and show its incompetency throughout his political career? Did he genuinely believe that the monarch was chosen by God and he would go to hell if he disobeyed?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
