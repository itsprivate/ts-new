  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The passage from Freeman reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There  was  a  certain  young  and  beautiful  nun  who  had  taken a vow of virginity, but by human weakness had given in to youthful desire and slept with a man. She became pregnant and her womb began to swell. She came to Brigid to seek her forgiveness and help. Drawing on the potent strength of her  matchless  faith,  holy  Brigid  blessed  the  young  woman  so that the fetus disappeared and she became a virgin again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also interesting to note that the story doesn&#39;t shame the nun for having an affair. While it&#39;s treated as a sin, the nun is motivated by &quot;human weakness&quot; and &quot;youthful desire,&quot; rather than being portrayed negatively. Brigid also readily forgives the nun and performs the miracle, making the fetus &quot;disappear.&quot; If a venerated saint such as Brigid was said to perform a miracle similar to an abortion, how would women seeking abortions be viewed at the time? Would nuns seeking abortions be treated any differently than other women?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
