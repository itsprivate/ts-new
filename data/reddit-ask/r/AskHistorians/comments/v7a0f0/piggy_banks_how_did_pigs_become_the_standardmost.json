As the title indicates, I’m curious as to why piggy banks came to be pig-shaped, as I can’t think of an obvious explanation for it despite how common they are. This is mainly directed at historians of the United States and Western Europe, although for all I know there may be influences from elsewhere in the world. Googling didn’t help me much beyond telling me that piggy banks became popular around the 1940s-1950s in the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
