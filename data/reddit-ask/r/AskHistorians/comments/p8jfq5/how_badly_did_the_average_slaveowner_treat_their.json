Our tour guide was a Black Creole and of course covered the horrendous treatment Blacks suffered there. However, towards the end of the tour, he heavily emphasized that plantation owners represented the upper crust of slaveowning society and that most slaveowners were middle/upper-middle class. For these slaveowners, he said, owning a slave was quite a considerable &quot;investment&quot; and that it was not financially viable to mistreat them. He also said that because these slaveowners couldn&#39;t just &quot;cycle&quot; through slaves and had more day-to-day interaction with them, it was not unheard of for them to become emotionally attached to their slaves, giving them more of an incentive to treat them with a modicum of decency.</p>\n\n<p>I understand it sounds like I&#39;m fishing for reason why slavery wasn&#39;t &quot;that bad,&quot; but I am not. I&#39;m just astounded that a literal descendent of slaves would offer up something that was semi-apologetic of the people who practiced it and I want to know if his claims have any validity.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
