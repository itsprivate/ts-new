Despite the myriad regime changes in France since then, sodomy/homosexuality was never officially recriminalized. France was centuries ahead of most of the West in this regard: Sodomy was not officially decriminalized a majority of European countries until after WWII, and 16 US states still had sodomy laws on the books until the 21st century. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What made France so comparatively progressive in this regard? One could pin it on the Revolution, but I don&amp;#39;t think that explains why it was another 150 years before most other comparable countries started to follow suit. And why wouldn&amp;#39;t sodomy be recriminalized during conservative post-revolution regimes like the Bourbon Restoration?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many thanks in advance, and happy pride month!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
