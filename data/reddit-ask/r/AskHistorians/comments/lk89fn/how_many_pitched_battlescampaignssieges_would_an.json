This struck me as a little surprising, since I could easily imagine that a single campaign would involve multiple pitched battles, to say nothing of the long skirmishes, sieges, and harassment of enemy/local forces that would be 90% of the time spent campaigning.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#39;s a long multi-part question, specifically regarding around late 1100s to late 1400s:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How exactly do you define a pitched battle? What draws the line between pitched battle and a skirmish?</li>\n<li>How many would campaigns an average men-at-arms/semi-professional soldier be called upon in their career?</li>\n<li>How many pitched battles, sieges, skirmishes, etc each would a campaign consist of?</li>\n<li>How did all of the above vary across region and time, and war? I would imagine most conflicts were mostly &#39;lets gather a few thousand men and loot some towns/villages&#39;, but a long campaign to reclaim Jerusalem or later when the Italian wars rolled around seems very different to me.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Bonus: all roads lead to Rome, so how many battles would a professional soldier of ~200 AD Rome see in their career?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
