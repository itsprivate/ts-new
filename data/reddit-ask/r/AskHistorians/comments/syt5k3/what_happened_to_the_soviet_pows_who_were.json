According to wiki:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike the German prisoners, who were looking forward to release at war&amp;#39;s end, the Soviet prisoners urgently requested asylum in the United States or at least repatriation to a country not under Soviet occupation, as they knew they would be shot by Stalin as traitors for being captured (under Soviet law, surrender incurred the death penalty).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question of the Soviet POWs&amp;#39; conduct was difficult to determine but not their fate if repatriated. Most Soviet POWs stated that they had been given a choice by the Germans: volunteer for labor duty with the German army or be turned over to the Gestapo for execution or service in an &lt;em&gt;Arbeitslager&lt;/em&gt; (a camp used to work prisoners until they died of starvation or illness). In any case, in Stalin&amp;#39;s eyes, they were dead men, as they had been captured alive, &amp;quot;contaminated&amp;quot; by contact with those in bourgeois Western nations, and found in service with the German Army.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notified of their impending transfer to Soviet authorities, a riot at their POW camp erupted. No one was killed by the guards, but some POWS were wounded, and others hanged themselves. Truman granted the men a temporary reprieve, but the Acting Secretary of State signed an order on July 11, 1945, forcing the repatriation of the Soviet POWs to the Soviet Union. On August 31, 1945, the 153 survivors were officially returned to the Soviet Union&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It says that we do not know what happened to them, but since then have we found anything that gives us an idea of what may have happened? Are there any official Soviet documents remaining, recording what happened to them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: (Sorry, I didn&amp;#39;t see the weekly theme flair, but I guess it kind of fits?)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
