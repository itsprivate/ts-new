Bell in 1927) and in private practice (such as when the American heiress Ann Cooper Hewitt was sterilized without her knowledge or consent on the request of her mother in the 1930s). One could pile on unethical medical experiments, such as the famous Tuskegee Syphilis Study, or Chester Southam&amp;#39;s multiple unethical cancer experiments in the mid 20th century (he was later elected president of the American Association for Cancer Research) as examples as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In theory, contemporary regulations, norms, and ethics guidelines that developed in response to these past abuses center patient consent in treatment decisions (and medical research). But how did the situation get to the point that physicians could operate on their human subjects with seeming impunity in the first place? It&amp;#39;s hard to imagine a late medieval physician taking such liberties, especially given historical European anxieties towards invasive bodily procedures that separated the physician from the surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondary question: is the doctor&amp;#39;s note/sick note a product of physicians&amp;#39; former elevated authority over their patients&amp;#39; lives, or is that strictly a labor phenomenon?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
