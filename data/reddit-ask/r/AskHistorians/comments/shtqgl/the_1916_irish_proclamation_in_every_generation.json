The 5 obvious ones seem the Confederate Wars of 1641, the United Irishmen of 1798, Robert Emmet in 1803, the Young Irelanders of 1848, the Fenians of 1867 (several of them are pushing the definition of a rising but they&amp;#39;ve entered the lore as such so I imagine they would have been in the authors&amp;#39; mind).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s the 6th? Is it the Nine Years War of 1594-1603? (slightly outside the 300 years but perhaps explained by poetic licence). The &amp;#39;Williamite War&amp;#39; which despite being a British civil  war is sometimes viewed through a nationalist lens due to its religious dimension (and would better fit the rising in every generation claim)? 1916 itself?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
