I also understand that, on this basis, certain Christian sects today do indeed promote celebrating the high holidays, but these are smaller non-mainstream sects.  It seems to me continuity with something so core to Judaism would have helped Christianity gain traction as an upstart religion, especially since Christianity otherwise was (and continues to be) typically expressed as a continuation of Judaic theology.  Given the historical precedent, the alternative interpretation available today, and the very practical reasons for maintaining the high holidays, I am curious why they were completely abandoned by the church.  I searched Wikipedia on this and came up empty-handed.  Curious if anyone here can weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
