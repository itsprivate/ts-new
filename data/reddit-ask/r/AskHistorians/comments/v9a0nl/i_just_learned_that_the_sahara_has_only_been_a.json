Mesopotamia is obviously pretty far from Africa, but historically speaking north African and middle eastern nomads have had contact with one another and seem could have theoretically had contact with Mesopotamian civilizations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do scholars believe any early written myths and legends discuss this? It is just astounding to me that the Sahara was relatively lush within a period that could theoretically be in the historical record. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apologies if this is a dumb question I just got off a Wikipedia deep dive and probably don&amp;#39;t have a full story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
