He had no idea what to expect on that now-fabled stretch of coastline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only when the invasion began did he learn that his mission was to film the D-day landing of the U.S Army’s 1st Infantry Division and 29th Infantry Division at Omaha Beach--from the German side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But whatever he saw, Hjorth (pronounced “Yorth”) was under standing orders not to discuss it for 50 years. Even today, the Cypress retiree’s mission remains an enigma: The film he shot, called unique by historians who recently learned of it from declassified documents, is missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re hunting it down,” said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history and director of the University of New Orleans’ Eisenhower Center. Hjorth’s movie footage and photographs--probably gathering dust in a government archive--are the only known invasion pictures from the German perspective shot at the Normandy beaches, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That article was almost 25 years ago.  So, what happened?  Is the film lost?  Is the story not true?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
