  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W93XyXHI8Nw\"&gt;The latest Kurzgesagt video&lt;/a&gt; talks about the likelihood of global civilization collapse. It briefly talked about population collapses in the past, and how no global catastrophe in written history ever decreased the global population below 10%, and quotes the following. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The last clear example of a rapid global population decrease was the black death. (timestamp 4:31)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It later shows a graph of global population growth that shows a steady increase in global population after the black death that carries on to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately thought about how that could be possible given how many native americans died following the arrival of europeans in the Americas. I even looked it up and found a paper that estimated that &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118307261\"&gt;56 million people died over the course of a century&lt;/a&gt; following 1492.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What could explain this discrepancy? Is it that the great die-off of people in the Americas was offset by a massive population boom in other places, so that there was a net increase or at least no net decrease in global population? Is it that Kurzgesagt is working on data that doesn&amp;#39;t account for the population of Americans the same was the paper I cited does? Do estimates of global population during historical times accurately represent people living in the Americas, especially prior to Columbus? Did Kurzgesagt simply overlook this information, falling into the bias of eurocentrism?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
