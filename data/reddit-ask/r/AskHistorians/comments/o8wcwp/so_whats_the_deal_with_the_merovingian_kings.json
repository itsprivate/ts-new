Actual power was increasingly in the hands of the mayor of the palace, the highest-ranking official under the king.</p>\n\n<p>Clotaire&#39;s son Dagobert I (died 639), who sent troops to Spain and pagan Slavic territories in the east, is commonly seen as the last powerful Merovingian King. Later kings are known as rois fainéants (&quot;do-nothing kings&quot;), despite the fact that only the last two kings did nothing. The kings, even strong-willed men like Dagobert II and Chilperic II, were not the main agents of political conflicts, leaving this role to their mayors of the palace, who increasingly substituted their own interest for their king&#39;s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Two paragraphs</em>, completely (and seemingly, to me) brushing over what must have been some <em>major</em> power shifts in the Merovingian kingdom, without any explanation <em>how</em> it happened, whether the Merovingian monarchs retained any level of power, whether there were any struggles or efforts to regain their power, what role the monarchs had in Merovingian society, how they were seen abroad, what factions there were, whether the kings were content with their diminished role, what specifically made the mayors so strong, etc. </p>\n\n<p>And it&#39;s not just Wikipedia. Everywhere I look, it seems that the transition from the Merovingian kings to the Frankish empire(s) starting with Karl Martel is incredibly blurry, getting glossed over in a half-sentence \n in the passive voice. </p>\n\n<p>So, what&#39;s the straight dope on the Merovingians? What happened to push what was arguably a formidable dynasty, to the sidelines? Is it just a matter of &quot;we don&#39;t really know, either&quot;? Or is there somewhere something to read that has a bit more meat to it, as it were?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
