When you read about the Napoleonic wars it seems he just arrived somewhere like Poland, Germany or Italy, and he sent his soldiers to force as many men as possible to join his armies&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Granted, many of those men probably joined willingly, but the descriptions of these events, and the speed with which they raised new armies, makes me suspect most of them were coerced into joining&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this view correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
