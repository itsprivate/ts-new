  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a senior undergrad working toward a BA in history. Ever since I got into college, I&amp;#39;ve wanted to teach history. I went into college wanting to do that and I still want to do that. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking increasingly about getting a PhD for a number of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I absolutely love to learn and share what I&amp;#39;ve learned with others. I would love to teach at the college level. I would love to teach on subjects that are more specialized than just World History or US History. Being a doctor of history would give me so much more opportunity to research, to learn, and to write. Being able to do that as a job would be my dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family, friends, coworkers, fellow students, and even my profs have been incredibly supportive of me, telling me that they think I should go for it and that I would be a good professor. I think I would, too: I&amp;#39;m passionate about history, I know I&amp;#39;m good at explaining information and concepts in an engaging way, and I love to learn and write. Every historian I know tells me how much they love their job and it&amp;#39;s very inspiring to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But everything I&amp;#39;ve read, including similar advice on this subreddit, is really discouraging me. I keep reading how long it takes to get a history PhD, how few opportunities there are for people with them, and how unlikely it is for me to find a job in the field. I read about how stupid people think getting a history PhD is, and I find lists telling me all sorts of reasons why getting one is a bad idea. This subreddit especially has been vocal on how foolish pursuing a history PhD is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talk about crushing. I&amp;#39;m becoming afraid that everything I&amp;#39;ve been working towards is for nothing and that I&amp;#39;m going to have to give up what I really want to do. I&amp;#39;m afraid that what I want isn&amp;#39;t the right thing for me for to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be talking to my advisor and academic advising about this, but I could really use some honest but gentle advice on what I should do. Thank you. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
