I mean, obviously, everyone knows that the primary source of the Gallic wars, &amp;quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&amp;quot; is propaganda; it was written by him as an explicit endorsement of himself as a politician. But in all the popular history I&amp;#39;ve read, he is always portrayed as this amazing genius who excels in every possible category.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sounds suspiciously like propaganda from his successor, Octavian. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Added to this, Octavian is often portrayed as the embodiment of Apollo, while his rival, Mark Anthony, is portrayed as a debauched moron, who is manipulated by Cleopatra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, Mark Anthony and Cleopatra controlled the richest part of the empire, and gave Octavian a run for his money, so they must have done something right. And I know that Octavian had a stranglehold on the cultural output of Rome in the early years, but all of this information has always been presented to me as fact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it sounds suspiciously like the kind of propaganda any autocrat with questionable legitimacy would put out: my predecessor is a genius and so am I, my rival was an imbecile and thus unfit to rule. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have a detailed explanation of the primary sources we use for the lives of these two great individuals? How much do modern historians trust these sources and why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
