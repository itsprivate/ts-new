  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a preface: my father is a terrible person, estranged from all his children and now deceased. As a result of his death my half-sisters and I went through his various documents and talked about our memories and from what we can piece together he seems to have had quite a globetrotting adventure that started with him being the son of a Ukrainian dirt farmer in Soviet Russia to a full US citizen that died of a heart attack in a Houston, TX suburb. It seems every move he made was to work towards US citizenship so I really just want to ask if what we figured out could have actually been possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was born in 1942 in Odessa, Ukraine (then obviously USSR) to a poor farming family. Apparently he hated his parents and worked very hard at school in the hopes that college, and a doctorate degree, would allow him to leave as Soviet citizens could not travel freely within the USSR unless they were highly educated. While he was in college he seduced and married one of his professors, while also getting a PHD (this is confirmed, we found his thesis and degree when we went through his estate, and my sisters are a result of his marriage to his professor). Apparently his degree and marriage granted him the ability to freely travel within the USSR (we&amp;#39;re less clear on this as my eldest sister, the only born in Russia, was an infant).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, and to his great and unexpected joy, Israel started offering birthright citizenship and the USSR agreed to respect it and allow Jews to leave. His first &amp;quot;target&amp;quot; happened to be ethnically Jewish. Apparently he would, as an ethnic Ukrainian/Muscotive with a now PHD, have otherwise not have been allowed to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They briefly moved to Italy, which I understand was one of the few waystations for people seeking Israeli birthright citizenship from the USSR, and then moved to Canada where they were granted full citizenship. From what we can figure out there were a handful of countries besides Israel that granted some form of refugee citizenship to people fleeing the Soviet Union. We don&amp;#39;t have a timeline on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having been granted full Canadian citizenship (this is confirmed as I have dual citizenship solely from him), he promptly left his wife and sought out work, ending up in the KSA, where he met my US born mother. I don&amp;#39;t want to get into how my mom ended up in the KSA, as that stuff is definitely confirmed, beyond the question of whether &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; as a Soviet-born Canadian citizen who&amp;#39;s citizenship originated from an Israeli birthright passport his wife held could have reasonable have been in the KSA in the late 70s/early 80s (my mom was definitely there, and single--which I&amp;#39;ve confirmed, however she says she met him in the KSA, if he couldn&amp;#39;t have been there it wouldn&amp;#39;t have been the first lie she told--I was definitely born out of wedlock for reasons which will be once clear later, so there&amp;#39;s a possibility this was just a story that was told to fit the timeline of my conception as being something that was planned by people who had been parried for a bit). Nonetheless they met and got married, according to my mother he approached her for a green card marriage but they subsequently fell in love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was born in New York in the mid 80s so that&amp;#39;s the end of the timeline. They were married and he at least had a green card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The were divorced in the late 90s but he apparently had full US citizenship at that point--and lived out the remaining 30 years of his life in Texas, but there&amp;#39;s a fold in that he apparently never divorced his first wife and his marriage to my mother was dissolved as &amp;#39;never legal in the first place&amp;#39; (this is confirmed) so I don&amp;#39;t know if that effects marriage citizenship. He certainly traveled internationally with no problem, but that could have been a good old fashioned US whoopsie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is really just is this possible? I&amp;#39;m happy to give more detail, I tried to lay everything out, but my sister&amp;#39;s know more as one of them was born in the USSR leg of the journey and the other in the Canadian, so I can ask them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
