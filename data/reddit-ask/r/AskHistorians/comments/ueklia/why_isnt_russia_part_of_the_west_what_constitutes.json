  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, there has been headline after headline talking about the &amp;quot;west&amp;quot;&amp;#39;s collective action to support Ukraine and counter Russian aggression. One thing that stood out to me is, despite the country essentially being European (technically Eurasian, but the majority of the population is European and lives in the European part), it is not treated as part of the &amp;quot;west.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that the terms &amp;quot;west&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;east&amp;quot; were European terms to divide the Eurasian continent between themselves and everyone else, essentially (which is why terms like &amp;quot;near east&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;middle east&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;far east&amp;quot; exist, as those regions have nothing in common with each other), adopted from the older terms of &amp;quot;Occident&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Orient.&amp;quot; Today, European offshoot colonial states are also considered western like the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that the Cold War and the Iron Curtain shifted geopolitical realities a lot, with all countries east of Germany being referred to as &amp;quot;Eastern European&amp;quot; as they were part of the communist bloc. &amp;quot;Western&amp;quot;, at least politically, has come to mean classical liberal and libertarian ideals, far from the socialism that was practiced in the other half of the continent, which I suppose made it more &amp;quot;eastern&amp;quot;, along with other communist countries like North Korea, China and Vietnam. Though I am not sure if this meant they stopped being considered &amp;quot;western&amp;quot; altogether, or ever were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is, has Russia ever been considered part of the &amp;quot;west&amp;quot;, and if has, when exactly did it stop being considered so? Does this extend to the rest of the soviet bloc, or just Russia? Where exactly is the line between East and West, has it shifted over time and why was it drawn in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
