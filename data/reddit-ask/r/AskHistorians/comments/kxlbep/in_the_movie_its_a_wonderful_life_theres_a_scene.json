My question is this: was this pool one of a kind at the time (or now), or were there other schools that built pools under their gym courts? I&#39;ve never seen this design anywhere else but in the movie. Did schools really have that kind of budget back then? How did they maintain their pools? Any pertinent information would be appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
