Thus, the Normans. The Normans would go on to be fairly successful, going on to form the ruling of class of places like England, Sicily, and the Crusader States.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is: to what extent did Normans consider themselves to be Norse, and how did this change? Presumably former vikings recently settled in now-Normandy would continue to consider themselves Northmen, and as far as I&amp;#39;m aware, if you grabbed someone off the street of Le Havre and asked them if they felt Nordic, they&amp;#39;d give you a funny look. Do we know when and how this change took place? Am I basing my question on a false pretense?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bonus question: when encountering the Norse-Gaels in Scotland and Ireland, and the Anglo-Norse in what had recently been the Danelaw, did the Normans in England feel kinship? What about Normans in the Mediterranean meeting Varangians?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
