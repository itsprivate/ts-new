But the act is almost dead and carnivals today look very little like carnivals back then (i.e. dangerous acts, sideshows, &quot;geeks,&quot; etc.). I&#39;m curious what social and economic factors led to the decline of the traditional American carnival. Increased regulations? New competitors in the entertainment space? Changing cultural attitudes?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
