This hatred seems to go back long before the Yugoslav wars since there are some examples of it in Clark&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The Sleepwalkers&amp;quot; (though I know this is a somewhat contentious book online) and I am just wondering how Yugoslavia was able to become united at all in the first place given this apparent hatred, as well as why it took so long (almost 10 years after the death of Tito) for the state to completely fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
