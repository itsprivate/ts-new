Incest and step-family porn over the last 8 years has seen a huge amount of dark financing coming from Russia and is basically everywhere now, from an active measures warfare perspective this normalizes and rewards antisocial ideas and increases the chance that some pervert turns it into antisocial behavior and sexually assaults a family member.
