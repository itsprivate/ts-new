My scant reading on Roman marriage practices often discuss the legal obligations of a husband or wife (and the broader list of ways a wife could fall afoul of them vs. a husband) as well the social expectations of a wife (often provided via historical anecdotes - Aemilia Tertia&amp;#39;s patient and forgiving attitude towards both Scipio Africanus and the woman he cheated with, for example), but very little on the expectations of a husband. I have run into Plutarch&amp;#39;s comments on Cato the Elder:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He used to say that the man who struck his wife or child, laid violent hands on the holiest of holy things. Also that he thought it more praiseworthy to be a good husband than a good senator [...] After the birth of his son, no business could be so urgent, unless it had a public character, as to prevent him from being present when his wife bathed and swaddled the babe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So: in terms of social expectations, what behaviors made a Roman man a good husband? What made him a bad husband? Does art and theatre tell us anything that ancient Roman biographers/historians and moralists don&amp;#39;t? And are any of our surviving voices those of Roman women themselves and what they wanted in a husband for themselves or female family members, or are our surviving sources only those of Roman men, describing ideals they ascribed to themselves and each other?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
