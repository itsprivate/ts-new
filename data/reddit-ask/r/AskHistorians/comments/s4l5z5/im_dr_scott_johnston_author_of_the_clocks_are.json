As a scholar I&amp;#39;m particularly interested in how timekeeping went from a local affair to a global system in the late 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Clocks are Telling Lies&lt;/em&gt; asks: why do we tell time the way we do? It shows how early proposals for standard time (time zones, etc.) envisioned by railway engineers such as Sandford Fleming, clashed with universal time (a single global time like UTC) promoted by astronomers. When both sides met in 1884 at the International Meridian Conference in Washington, DC, to debate the best way to organize time, disagreement abounded. Scientific and engineering experts found it hard to agree, and the public was equally divided. Following some of the key players in the debate, the book reveals how people dealt with the contradictions in global timekeeping in surprising ways - from zealots like Charles Piazzi Smyth, who campaigned for the Great Pyramid to serve as the prime meridian, to Maria Belville, who sold the time door to door in Victorian London, to Indigenous communities that used timekeeping to fight for autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things you might be interested to ask about:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Anything about time zones, the prime meridian, astronomy and timekeeping, railways and timekeeping, longitude at sea and mapmaking, selling the time, time signals/time guns, the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, timekeeping in international diplomacy and imperialism, the prime meridian conference of 1884, the debates about adopting the metric system (which was surprisingly relevant to timekeeping), timekeeping in schools, and anything else you might be wondering about global time measurement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things I might be able to answer but are outside my primary area of expertise:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Timekeeping in the ancient or medieval world, calendars, daylight savings&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are interested in a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Clocks are Telling Lies&lt;/em&gt;, the mods tell me that the following links are Affiliate codes that will support &lt;a href=\"/r/AskHistorians\"&gt;r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt;, helping fund community events like the annual conference.
