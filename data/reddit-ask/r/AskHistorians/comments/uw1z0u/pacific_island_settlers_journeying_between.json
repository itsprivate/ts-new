And (partly) separate from that, what were the cultural ideas and beliefs surrounding such exploration? Was it a community-sponsored and (hopefully) well-planned excursion with perhaps an expansionist mindset like many European journeys, something grounded more in desperation, when crops failed or overcrowding became a problem, or something else entirely?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
