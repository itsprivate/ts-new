  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a twofer! I want to know what are some better sources for learning about Salazar and the Estado Novo, and find out if it&amp;#39;s feasible for &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_de_Oliveira_Salazar\"&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt; to be improved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know much about Salazar. I heard that he is revered among some modern authoritarians as an ideal dictator (see this American Conservative article &lt;a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/waiting-for-our-salazar/\"&gt;Waiting for Salazar&lt;/a&gt; ), and I went to my preferred initial source for more information. What I found was a sprawling hagiography, and a sense that I still don&amp;#39;t know much about Salazar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else seeking more information on him might go to Wikipedia and come out thinking this guy is the bee&amp;#39;s knees, which is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see some stuff on &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ant%C3%B3nio_de_Oliveira_Salazar\"&gt;the article&amp;#39;s talk page&lt;/a&gt; expressing that it is biased, but there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have been much movement on that discussion in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard that Wikipedia can be cliquey and difficult to work with, but I want to ring the alarm bell for this article in particular. Even getting a &amp;quot;this article&amp;#39;s neutrality is disputed&amp;quot; flag at the top would be good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes that demonstrate the article&amp;#39;s general pro-Salazar stance, which state virtuous justifications for authoritarian politics without any challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The secret police existed not only to protect national security in a modern sense, but also to suppress the regime&amp;#39;s political opponents ... which was seen by the regime as a menace to Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Restoring order to the national accounts, enforcing austerity and red-penciling waste, Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses, an unparalleled novelty in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liberalism and Parliamentarism may have worked in Great Britain and the United States, but the Portuguese argued that liberalism was inappropriate in their nation and culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Salazar] wanted a system in which the people would be represented through corporations, rather than through divisive parties, and where national interest was given priority over sectional claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
