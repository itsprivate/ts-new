They were competent, maybe not all of them, but in the Ethiopian royal family there had to be at least a few competent people, after all they successfully resisted the Ottomans and Europeans for centuries. And finally they were completely unrelated to any European royal family and to Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Of course there was the issue with racism, but they ended up choosing a literal peasant, a son of a farmer with no prestige at all. In contrast the Ethiopian royal family was a centuries old dynasty, ruling an ancient and respected nation, one of the first to convert to christianity, heck, they could have argued they were descendants of the legendary Prester John... although maybe I&#39;m wrong and racism was such a big issue they would have preferred any white person before a king with dark skin</p>\n\n<p>In summary, given my understanding of that situation, the Ethiopian royal family was the ideal place for the Swedish parliament to look for a new king, but they never even considered it, and I don&#39;t know why</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
