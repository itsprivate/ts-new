But I can&amp;#39;t seem to find anything on whether or not Spain attempted to take the province back. You&amp;#39;d think that at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 that Spain would attempt to push for the province to return to Spain, but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like that was the case, but I 100% could be wrong on this. Nor can I find anything about Franco wanting the region back as condition for joining the Axis in WW2. He, in all likelyhood in bad faith, pushed to gain all of Morocco, Cameroon and Gibraltar in exchange for joining the war, but wouldn&amp;#39;t Roussillon be a natural addition as well? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer that I&amp;#39;m assuming to be most likely, is simply that Catalonia was not seen as a part of &amp;quot;Spain&amp;quot; proper and thus the Spanish weren&amp;#39;t that interested in enlarging the province again. But that&amp;#39;s just my guess, and I can&amp;#39;t seem to find any definitive answers on this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any replies!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
