Was there something about Delmonicos in particular that &amp;quot;old society&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t like? Was it the kind of place where married men brought their mistresses? Or were private restaurants part of a broader cultural shift between old money and new money?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
