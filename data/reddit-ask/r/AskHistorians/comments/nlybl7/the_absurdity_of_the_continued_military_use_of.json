With the notable exception of the United States no military had made semi-automatic rifles standard issue by 1939.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware that the Germans and the Soviets mass produced semi-auto rifles but the overwhelming majority of rifle-caliber guns produced by these nations was still the bolt action rifle by far. I can understand why countries like Italy and Japan would not adopt a semi-auto as their industry did not have the capacity to do such a thing. But a country like Germany of all places not having their own version of the m1 garand is just asinine in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to preemptively address one of the talking points I often see when interwar semi automatic rifles are discussed: the argument that the Germans centered their doctrine around the then revolutionary belt-fed light/medium machinegun, and therefore did not see the need for semi-auto rifles. My response to this argument is this: <strong>why wouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t the Germans just have both?</strong> In the 1960s, not too long after the war, the United States had BOTH a main infantry weapon that fired faster than a bolt-action (M16) AND a supplementary belt-fed infantry support LMG (the M60).  (and yes I am aware that the m16 fires an intermediate cartridge but my point still stands).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
