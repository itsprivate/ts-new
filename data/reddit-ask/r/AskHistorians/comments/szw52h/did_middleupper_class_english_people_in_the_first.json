Something I have noticed is that characters will often call on each other at home, go out for dinner, etc at 9 or 10pm. To me this seems later in the evening than would be common now - many restaurants wouldn&amp;#39;t even be open past 10pm, and going round to see someone after 9pm seems strange to me unless it&amp;#39;s an emergency. The characters are generally upper or at least upper middle class people and aren&amp;#39;t portrayed as wild partiers at all. Is this something that was culturally different at this time? Is it as simple as these people not having to get up early for jobs?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
