Over 70% of his tattoos follow classical Chinese acupuncture points. These points have been used to treat rheumatism, which Ötzi suffered through during his life time, as well as gastro-intestinal problems.). If you look at them, they also resemble what we see in therapeutic tattooing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The craziest thing to me though, is that Otzi lived 5200 years ago, and the first mention of acupuncture in China was the Yellow Emperor&amp;#39;s Classic of Internal Medicine, in 2600 BC (More likely 300-100BC). However, even at the earliest, Otzi lived between 3350 and 3105 BC, placing his therapeutic tattooing long before China&amp;#39;s own acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen mention of therapeutic tattooing being done as far back as 6000BC, but I&amp;#39;m not certain on that. So the question is, where did acupuncture really begin? Who discovered those acupuncture points? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any experts on this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
