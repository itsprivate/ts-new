It is well established that Caesar greatly exaggerated the sizes of the forces opposing him in his Commentaries, so he had no qualms with playing fast and loose with the truth to accentuate his own brilliance. Is it likely then that he omitted a lot of decisive action on the part of the Gauls in his retelling of the conquest?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
