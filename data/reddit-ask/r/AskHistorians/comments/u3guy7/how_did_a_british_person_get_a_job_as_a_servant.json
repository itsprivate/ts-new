They did the expected stuff like making and serving their food or cleaning the manors, but more powerful people had them doing pretty much everything. The duke didn’t even pull out his own chair. Who were these people in these positions? What kind of background did they come from? Was it harder/more prestigious to get a job with the royal palace vs like a viscounts household or was it the same? And how did one end up a household manager who kind of runs the show and is the boss of the other staff like the queen or the duke had?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
