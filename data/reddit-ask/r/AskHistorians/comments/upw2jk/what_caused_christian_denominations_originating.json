By contrast, denominations such as Catholicism, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, Methodism, Orthodoxy, etc. that either developed or became more influential in Europe largely did not follow the same path. For example, while there may be pockets of Biblical creationism, denial of climate change, etc. among Catholics or other groups, they tend to be a small if vocal minority. What were the historical and cultural reasons as to why America-originating denominations tend to be more Biblical literalist and science-skeptic compared to their counterparts in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have read somewhere before that suggested that one possible factor was that, during the Great Awakenings, the pastors and other religious leaders tended to be less educated and thus less familiar with things like critical analysis of the Bible, things that may have been more familiar to more educated clergy and other religious figures in Europe. Is this theory accurate or could it have just been conjecture?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
