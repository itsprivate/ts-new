I have no problem with him looking at free stuff, but something about giving them money and having private convos with them irks me. I obviously expressed how much I don’t like it, and put it in terms of if I was doing the same thing how would he feel. He agreed with me then that it was not okay. He has since said that he wants me to sit down with him and delete the account. \nI just want to make sure that I’m not being crazy or insecure.
