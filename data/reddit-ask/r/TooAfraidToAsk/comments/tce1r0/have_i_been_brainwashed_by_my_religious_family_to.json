You can imagine how the whole class took a massive shit on me for suggesting that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now looking back on that.... I kind of feel like I was brainwashed into saying those things. I think it comes from an event when I was 10 and I got molested by someone in a church home and my Mom and dad made me go to a church and &amp;#39;forgive&amp;#39; him publicly in front of a bunch of people...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure what to think, some feedback would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
