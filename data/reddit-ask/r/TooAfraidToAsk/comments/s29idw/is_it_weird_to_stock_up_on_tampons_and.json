I also do that when I&amp;#39;m single. I restock whenever it&amp;#39;s almost gone and this practice has ben very useful on many occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current gf thought it was surprising when we first started dating, but she said in a good way. Now on the other hand this topic came up with some friends yesterday and they thought it&amp;#39;s super &amp;#39;weird af&amp;#39; to do that and they&amp;#39;ve never heard of a guy buying tampons or pills just in case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: The BC is the one prescribed to 80% of women where I am and I get the prescription renewed whenever necessary by my gp. He thinks it&amp;#39;s ok to have a pack at home for safety reasons when you&amp;#39;re sexualy active.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
