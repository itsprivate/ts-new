All they do is complain about how unfair their student debt burden is, as they constantly extend the payments.... but all I see is that they mostly moved away to expensive big cities chasing social lives, etc. They knew what they were getting into. We all did. I can&amp;#39;t help but see this all as a very unfair deal for those of who PAID. So I ask, legitimately, what will I get?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
