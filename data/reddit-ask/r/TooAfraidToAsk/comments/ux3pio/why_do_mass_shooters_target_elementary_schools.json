Can anyone explain the logic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, someone who shoots up his own high school is often motivated by a desire to hurt people he knows. Someone who targets a gathering place of a certain race is motivated by racism. Do the men who commit massacres at elementary schools have disproportionate hate for young children? Do they think they’ll have an easier time there with targets who can’t defend themselves? Is there some other reason? If someone could illuminate the thinking I’d be interested to hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Also, as a related question, if someone is that miserable why don’t they just kill themselves?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
