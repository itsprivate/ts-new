For extra context, we are in Europe where the drinking age is 18 (personally I think the drinking age of 21 in America is weirdly high, as is the general consensus in Europe). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The age of consent where we live is 16, but even if it was 18 that would be fine because like I said, we didn&amp;#39;t actually meet until after she turned 18 (although we clearly knew we liked each other when she was a month or two away from 18). I am not worried about the legality because I know for a fact there are no legal issues here, I am worried about the ethics of it in the eyes of society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think I will I be seen as a creep by most people? Some people? Hardly any people? Just looking to get some opinions here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
