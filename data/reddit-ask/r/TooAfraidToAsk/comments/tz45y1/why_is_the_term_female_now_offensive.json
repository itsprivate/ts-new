Incels frequently use female as an insult. Because of this people associate people who use this word with those who are incels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: It would be very helpful if you could explain this to people using female and not just try an cancel them. I&amp;#39;m very clueless on incels and 4chan so there is no way of me even knowing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: An example of it being used by incels is &lt;a href=\"/r/menandfemales\"&gt;r/menandfemales&lt;/a&gt; which uses it degrade women I believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
