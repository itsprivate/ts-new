How come people want one thing, yet be against that very same thing? Like I&amp;#39;ve heard both conservatives, liberals, feminists and men&amp;#39;s rights activists say that they want men to be able to show emotions without being shamed or be judged for it, yet as men do show their emotions they&amp;#39;re getting hell for it (by these people!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We want men to be emotional as their current apathetic way of expressing emotions is hurting our society because patriarchy is a damaging structure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet after being told this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hahaha look at this pathetic man who is showing emotions! Man up, you manbaby!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously it is just an example of their reasoning. Anyway, it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense. Please explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To clarify: No, I&amp;#39;m not an incel. Just curious is all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
