I’m reading through all the comments right now but unfortunately I start a 6+ hour shift in a few minutes and cannot answer them all. I’ve seen so much helpful advice that I genuinely wouldn’t have thought of on my own, my phone is now filled with screenshots haha. You’ve all been a really big help and now I feel less anxious about going grocery shopping :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to the occasional assholes in here… you clearly don’t belong on this sub, and I hope you get removed &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I came to this subreddit because I assumed everyone answering would be nice, but clearly some of you don’t belong here. It’s called “too afraid to ask” for a reason and some of you really just made a point about why I was afraid to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of us didn’t have parents who taught us how to do things. I’m really happy that some of you did, but others weren’t so lucky. There’s lots of shit I had to learn all on my own and that’s already embarrassing enough, you don’t need to be an asshole and rub salt in the wound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To everyone who took the time out of their day to try and help, tysm, I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
