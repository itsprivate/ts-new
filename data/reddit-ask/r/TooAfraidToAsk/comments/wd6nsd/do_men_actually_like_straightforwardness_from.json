My close friends were almost all LGBTQ+ and the straight friends I had I was not that close to. All I know about straight men and how they think is things I read on the internet. I am now interested in trying to date a man and literally have no clue how to approach it. I am usually extremely straight forward so the other day I was at a coffee shop and found this guy very cute so I walked up to him and told him I found him cute and would be interested in getting to know him if he’d like my number, this guy legit froze and just looked at me and didn’t say anything. After a few awkward seconds I walked away and he yelled “wait” I looked back and said what and he didn’t even say anything. That was kind of embarrassing for me as I thought maybe I came on too strong. I’ve seen online men say they like if a woman is honest but…. That went very bad for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can I get advice on how to approach men?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
