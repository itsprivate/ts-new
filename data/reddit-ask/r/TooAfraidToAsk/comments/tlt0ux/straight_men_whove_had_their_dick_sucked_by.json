But i’m curious as to how you came to that conclusion, and how you felt about it afterwards? Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Idk why some of y’all can’t understand this, but straight people can and do get curious about their own sexuality. Just because they may have experimented doesn’t mean they’re not straight anymore… All it means is that they experimented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, any form of stimulation to your genitals does not define your sexuality either. Your dick will get hard regardless of who’s doing the stimulating and regardless if you want to be hard or not, because that’s how bodies work. Your body doesn’t give a shit about who you’re attracted to, it’s going to do whatever it feels like doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit 2: Also yes I technically can experience this myself, with me (as a gay man) and another woman. But it’s almost 2:00 am and I don’t really want to experiment with my sexuality right now, so I just thought i’d ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit 3: I haven’t seen this comment but I know it’s coming, and no, I am not doubting that straight men exist. And no, I do not think that straight men can be “turned” gay. Like, that is scientifically impossible. I was just curious about straight men who have experimented with their sexuality…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
