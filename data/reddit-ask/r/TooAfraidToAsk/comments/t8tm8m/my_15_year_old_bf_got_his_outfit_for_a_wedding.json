Tbh my bf can&amp;#39;t stand nice clothes and i can imagine he would give his mom a hard time buying him something nice, but the fact that he isn´t allowed to choose anything at all is kind of weird and funny at the same time. His parents are usually very relaxed and allow him quite a lot, so that strict behaviour by his mom surprised me a lot. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, his outfit for the wedding is super cute and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing him in it longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
