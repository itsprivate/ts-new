I’ve told them time after time that I’m very insecure about my breasts (they’re small) and it’s like they wait after awhile, hoping that I somehow grow out of the insecurity, then send me these kind of memes again. \nI got angry and they responded by complimenting my ass as if it were to make up for the meme. \nIt’s frustrating for me because there have also been times where they tell me that breast size doesn’t matter to them, and all beast sizes matter, etc. It really confuses me and I’m getting mixed signals.\nThey are also the type of person to tell me that I overreact a lot. Am I overreacting? What do I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
