  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (26F) have been together with my boyfriend (34M) for around 3 years now. Everything was going great and I was deeply in love with this person. He said he was too and we were planning to get married, have kids in the future etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year I’ve had a surgery and gained a lot of weight cause I was not allowed to move around much. Obviously with the lack of workout and a normal appetite I gained weight fast. I felt terrible and embarrassed about it but my boyfriend always reassured me that he loves me the way I am. But his actions didn’t match his words…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started to follow a ton of girls on instagram and whenever we went to the shop nearby he was basically eyefucking almost everyone. I’ve got even more insecure and literally hated myself. All the sex we had, I initiated. I just had this feeling that he wasn’t into me anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the doctor told me that I can do moderate workout (walking and swimming) so I started to do that. I was counting calories and lost weight quite fast. Obviously still have weight to lose but I’m looking better than before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend changed and he initiates sex, wants to hug me and kiss me all day, putting our pictures on social media and so on. But I feel like I’m resenting him for how he treated me back then… I can barely get an orgasm cause all I can think of is he being attracted to everyone else. Plus I have a little anxiety cause what if I’ll gain weight again in the future? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it normal that I feel like this? Or our relationship is over?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
