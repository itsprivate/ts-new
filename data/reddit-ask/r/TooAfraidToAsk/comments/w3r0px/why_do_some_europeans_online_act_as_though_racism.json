  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see some Europeans online sometimes act as though racism is an America only problem or something. But as a black person, some of the most blatant displays of racism I and other black friends I know happened when we were traveling around Europe. These incidents included: being called the “n” word and “ugly black” on the street by random people, not being allowed into nightclubs because “darkies” weren’t allowed, being completely ignored for service at a restaurant while others weren’t, and completely crossing the street with a look of utter disgust when we walked by. These countries in question were Italy, Portugal, Spain, Germany (not Berlin) Greece and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that some countries don’t have a large minority population so they’re not used to seeing people like me but there’s a very real difference between fascination/interest and blatant racism. I’ve experienced both and the fascination is totally fine and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im not saying this is representative of these countries as a whole nor am I saying everyone or even the majority of people in those countries are racist. I still enjoyed my vacations in Europe despite these instances and I would still encourage people to travel there, but I just don’t like it when people play pretend and act like Europe is some colorblind utopia. So why do some Europeans people do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
