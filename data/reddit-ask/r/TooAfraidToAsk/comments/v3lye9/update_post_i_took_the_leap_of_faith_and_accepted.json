  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I posted that my chosen parents had let me know they had a desire to legally adopt me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last 24 hours on a roller coaster of emotions, and Reddit helped and hindered that experience for me. Some of you were a huge help and support and some others made me feel I had no choice but to decline. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight I asked my chosen parents the backstory and if their kids knew, if their kids were accepting of it etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently they reached out to a lawyer on March 1st to see if we met the criteria for adult adoption and once they found out that we would meet the criteria they got more information from their lawyer about the process to make it happen, and decided they wanted to suggest that offer to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then at the beginning of April they told their kids that they wanted to legally adopt me and asked for all of their true opinions on it. Apparently that went over completely fine and everyone agreed it was a good choice because it would protect me if I have got hurt or sick and needed someone to act on my behalf, plus their kids thought maybe it would help me feel more apart of the family. They even showed me the group text messages their kids sent last night and sent this morning asking if I had told them yes or no yet because they’ve been waiting to find out my decision. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around 6:45 tonight I sat them down, asked for the backstory and then once I had my questions answered I told them I wanted them to adopt me. I even called them Mom and Dad for the first time (I’ve only ever used their first names). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom broke down immediately and hugged me for a while as she cried. Dad held it together emotionally until I told him I wanted to have his last name. I also told them I didn’t want to keep my bio mother’s name as my middle name. I told them I wanted them to come up with a couple names that they like that I could choose from. I told them since they never had a biological child together (all their kids are from their first marriages) they never got to name a child together so I wanted them to get to have a say in my new middle name, plus for me that will carry sentimental value. Dad said he was never going to tell me he wanted me to take his last name because he wanted it to be 100% my choice but that it means the world that I want his name. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I’m spending the night here again tonight because the emotions are running high and I want to be near them for one more night......... but I’M GETTING ADOPTED!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
