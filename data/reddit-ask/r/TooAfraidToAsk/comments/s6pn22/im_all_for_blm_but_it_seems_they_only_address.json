In about 80-90% of the cases, the Black victim was killed by another Black, and about 52% of the murder victims were acquainted with their assailant (AKA gang relation and retaliation.) If we truly wanted the best for the African-American community shouldn&amp;#39;t this be a more talked about point in terms of BLM and not just white supremacy/racism (even though this definietly plays a problem as well, though obviously not as big as black on black homicide, though it gets nowhere as much airtime and attention). Why do you believe this issue isn&amp;#39;t more well known and discussed? Shame? Or something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: no one seems to be answering the question. Why isn&amp;#39;t BLM (if they really wanna save black men’s lives) doing more to address black on black violence?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
