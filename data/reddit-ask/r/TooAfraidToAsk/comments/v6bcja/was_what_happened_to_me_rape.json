I don&amp;#39;t judge people for that but its just my personal choice. I just turned 20 and during the entire rs he would constantly ask me to do it with him and i always said no and explained to him the reasons why so it was a pretty well known fact in our rs and he knew damn well that i never wanted to have sex. One night we got pretty drunk and it just happened, i was so so drunk and we were in bed and he tried to put it in, i told him it hurts and briefly remember saying stop. But he still continued! All i remember from that night was the pain and just saying ouch the whole time and him saying shhh And thats the worst part that i barely even remembered us having sex. The next morning he acted like nothing happened. He blamed it on him being drunk as well but like even when i was sober he knew i would 100% say no and he knew how important this decision is for me. Looking back it should have been a red flag that he constantly asked me to have sex when he should have respected my decision and stopped trying. When i confronted him he made me feel crazy and i just feel taken advantage of in my most vulnerable state. Any advice would be helpful i feel so sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
