The kids at her middle school call her “ghetto” and “fake black”, like she’s pretending to be black. They don’t accept her. Someone help me understand a different perspective because it’s starting to make me think everyone in the whole world is racist. The news/media tells us only white people can be racist and I’m calling BS on that. Why is America so obsessed with the color of our skin?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
