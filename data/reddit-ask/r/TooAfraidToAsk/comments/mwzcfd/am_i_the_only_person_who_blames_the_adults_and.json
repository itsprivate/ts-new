Especially the guy who was yelling at the cop after he shot her but yet minutes before he is kicking that other girl in the head. Really sir, maybe you should have tried breaking up the situation. There is so misinformation going on about this but from what others are saying the other girls came to jump Makhia and she called the police. However, an adult should have tried to calm her down and took the knife away from her . As someone who has grown up in the hood i see stuff like this all the time growing up where these adults will bring they kids to someone house and watch them fight and then when someone ends up hurt its everyone else fault. No I blame the parents and adults for this one.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
