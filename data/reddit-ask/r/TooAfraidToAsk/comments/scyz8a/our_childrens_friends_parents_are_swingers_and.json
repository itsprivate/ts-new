My oldest and middle child are very good friends with the swinger parent’s kids who are in the same grade. They came over last Saturday to watch football and UFC. When they party, they party hard (get pretty drunk). The wife gets very touchy feely when she is wasted. And this time around she was trying to make out with my wife, me as well as trying to rub my junk, and her husband started getting touchy feely with my wife. Told us she was bi and has had multiple threesomes. Husband didn’t care that his wife was all over me. I told them it was pretty late, and it was time to wrap up the party. We really like these people as they are fun to hang around and our kids are best friends. But they are clearly swingers and wanted to “swap” which isn’t our thing at all. This has us pretty weirded out, and we just want things to be normal. Not sure if we should pretend it didn’t happen, or let them know we like them and aren’t judgmental of their lifestyle but that isn’t our thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
