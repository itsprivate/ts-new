But then when  t comes to False claims of rape and sexual assault, I constantly hear how it&amp;#39;s as worse as being a rapists, that it can completely ruin the life of the accused even when it was discovered that the claims were false. It&amp;#39;s kind of confusing to me because both sides seem to contradict each other. I don&amp;#39;t know anyone who has ever been raped or sexually assaulted so I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
