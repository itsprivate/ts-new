She thought she was funny taking me to Olive Garden were they sell microwave pasta but that’s beside point here. After dinner she really liked me and I told her i want out of my house and explain my situation. We go to her place with a bottle of wine and we’re fine watching The Office (funny) but then she starts trying to have sex?? Why? Why so quickly you dont even know me. I could be STD and she just okay? Im here for 2 more weeks and Its not looking promising. Am I using wrong apps? Or is this the culture…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
