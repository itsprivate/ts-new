I was shocked to find that she isn’t paying for her low income aunt to travel over (from another country a great distance away). My boyfriend isn’t receiving any help with travel expenses either and has already had to pay for his wedding clothes &amp;amp; food for the guests she’s having him entertain at his flat. He’s disabled and I know it’s a lot for him, though he hasn’t complained. Is this typical?  I’ve never been to a destination wedding but they seem rather selfish to me. I couldn’t imagine asking people to pay to travel to another country for MY wedding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
