This is not intended to be hateful, nor is this a &amp;quot;bait&amp;quot; post, this is just a question I&amp;#39;ve often had and that I get amongst my group of friends as well. It seems like putting a word after white is either a no-no or just sounds bad, but those same &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t apply for using the word black in the same way. Other than that, you don&amp;#39;t see other races like &amp;quot;Asian&amp;quot; used in the same way at all. Appreciate any real answers. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
