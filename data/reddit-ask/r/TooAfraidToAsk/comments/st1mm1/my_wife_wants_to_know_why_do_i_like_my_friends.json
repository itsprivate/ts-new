My wife sees this as me enjoying my time with them more than her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just isn&amp;#39;t true and I&amp;#39;ve tried to explain to her before but she&amp;#39;s brought it up again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure someone&amp;#39;s dealt with a similar situation and can shed light before I organize marriage counseling :,)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
