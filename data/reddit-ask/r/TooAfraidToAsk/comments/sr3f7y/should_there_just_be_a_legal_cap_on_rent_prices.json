In some states that have a $7.25 minimum, the rent for a 2 bed can be as low as $250. That’s almost 1/5 of the rent for only half the pay. You get a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; deal when you go to a lower wage state!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These places with high wages aren’t helping because the landlords will charge whatever people are willing to pay. With gentrification, there is no incentive to charge fair prices. Should the government cap rent as some formula of the minimum wage? I’m not sure what other solutions there are, but this is unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
