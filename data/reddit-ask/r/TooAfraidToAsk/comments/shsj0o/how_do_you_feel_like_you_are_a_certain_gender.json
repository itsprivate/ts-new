But that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily change one&amp;#39;s gender identity afaik. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most human also have a preference for one thing over another- e.g., some girls like combat sports, some girls like ballet. I also get and support this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, what I&amp;#39;m confused about is...how does one feel what gender they are? Most humans have organs which determine our biological sex - this part I get - but how do you feel male, female, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone who was born biologically male likes e.g., hot pink and make up...does that mean they feel like a woman or do they just feel like a person who likes hot pink and make up? Isn&amp;#39;t the fact that people are prescribing specific gender identities to various groups of items something society is trying to progress away from?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
