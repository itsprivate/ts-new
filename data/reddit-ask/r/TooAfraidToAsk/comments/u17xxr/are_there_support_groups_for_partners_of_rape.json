I feel like I have to constantly put my needs to the side because you can&amp;#39;t compromise with trauma. I know that none of this is her fault and thats what sucks, I feel like I can&amp;#39;t talk about this with anyone because if I talk to her I make her feel bad and I&amp;#39;m certainly not just going to out her to someone else. I love this girl and can honestly see spending my life with her... Its just hard I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question I guess is: are there support groups or anything for partners of sexual assault? I&amp;#39;ve been to therapy but idk it felt weird just talking about my relationship with her and I feel like talking with others in my situation could be helpful. Any advice or anything is super appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you, hope you have a good day!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
