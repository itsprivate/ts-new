After 7 years of great sex while dating, my wife&amp;#39;s sex drive fell off a cliff within the first year of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been 4 years now, and we have sex maybe once every two months or so. And never, ever do I get a random bj or hj.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first couple years it really affected my self esteem. And my wife did seem upset that she no longer had the urge. But we&amp;#39;ve both kind of settled on the fact that that&amp;#39;s just how it is now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sucks that I&amp;#39;m only 34, and still have a high sex drive, yet am apparently going to go without it for the rest of my life, except maybe a handful of times a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And before it comes up: yes everything else is pretty darn good in our relationship. I care for her and our baby (the drop in sex happened years before pregnancy/baby).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also give her special attention every single night (30-60 minute legs rubs while we lay in bed and watch tv/she plays on her phone). And maybe it&amp;#39;s wrong, but I do resent the fact that I do this every night for her happiness, yet I can&amp;#39;t get the occasional reciprocation to make me happy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate feeling upset about not getting sex - it makes me feel shallow. But, here we are...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this just how it goes for the majority of married guys? Or do many married guys still get blowies regularly and have good sex lives? (Obviously every relationship is going to be different... I&amp;#39;m just curious if this is really how it is in the majority of cases, and I need to just get over it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose this may be more of a rant to get things off my chest, but damn. It sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
