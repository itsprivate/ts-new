  "title": "Why is liking petite/short thin girls with small boobs/butt considered pedophilia?",
  "created_utc": 1659057427,
  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, I&amp;#39;m a 19 year old 4&amp;#39;10&amp;quot; thin girl, I weigh 90lb, have small boobs/butt and I look like a teen. Needless to say, one of my best friends prefers petite and thin girls like me and he is often shamed and labeled as pedophile. Not to mention people joked about my body type in the past and told me I will never have somebody for looking like a child, people compared me to anime lolis and said some... pretty unwanted and bad jokes about how I look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just makes me sad that this is still perceived as pedophilia. I like to feel attractive because I&amp;#39;m an adult woman with sexual needs, but my wishes are belittled just because of my young appearance. And people who are attracted to my body type suffer even more, since they are labeled pedos, who is something really worse to call someone. Why you&amp;#39;re only considered a man if you like thicc women? Aren&amp;#39;t petite women real women? I genuinely don&amp;#39;t understand. And also, just because men like petite women doesn&amp;#39;t mean they are lolicons or like anime lolis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same people who claim these statements surprisingly seem to be attracted to anime girls with huge desproportional boobs that happen to be underaged since almost every anime female character is a highschooler, so they aren&amp;#39;t in a legal age yet. Why isn&amp;#39;t being attracted to curvy girls considered pedophilia, if they&amp;#39;re literally underaged?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This excuse of liking petite girls being pedophilia seems just casual body shaming to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I see a lot of people misunderstanding the original meaning of the post. I&amp;#39;m specifically talking about women who are over 18+ obviously. These women can either be recent adults, married, mothers, workers or just adult women who happen to have that body type. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are shamed or called pedos for having a wife/girlfriend that has my body type. I&amp;#39;m talking about people who already knew their partners beforehand and are attracted to them as a whole, including their body type (that happens to be the body type I described on the post). Of course I won&amp;#39;t defend someone who is attracted to underaged people, regardless of their body type. Neither I would defend people who are merely attracted to somebody just because they have body features that resemble a certain age period. I apologize for my choice of words.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
