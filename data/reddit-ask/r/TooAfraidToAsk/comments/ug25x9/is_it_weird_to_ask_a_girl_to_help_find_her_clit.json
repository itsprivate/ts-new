I always was so confident during sex as you learn alot about someone for 2 years. I never had issues finding her clit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been with a few one night stands now and for some of them I honestly I had no idea if I was touching there clit. Maybe my exgf one was bigger ( if that&amp;#39;s a thing?) Or just easier to find. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the ol trick going upwards from her pussy you will then come across it but I&amp;#39;ve tried that and wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I touched it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be fiddling around down there for ages so usually if I can&amp;#39;t find it after a few seconds I just leave it. Would it be weird to ask, am I hitting it ? Or something along the lines of that lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t want to come across has a noob and be rubbing some random ass spot, thinking it&amp;#39;s her clit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
