However, our house gets really dirty from the kids and she doesnt maintain it. She doesnt clean well or much at all. Kids are at school all day and I work a full time job and 3 part time jobs to pay the bills. She does do errands each day but then also naps for several hrs each day too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I approach this? I would love to hire a cleaner but that would require her going back to work to pay for it which is a whole other issue. Other option is for me to do it but I literally do not have the time. When I bring this stuff up she gets really mad at me. Otherwise we are very happy together. Its just these few issues we cant work out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She says my stance on her cleaning is from the 1940s. But she is home all day while kids at school. I am working like 70 hrs a week to pay for everything. Suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
