The main issue is that I get wetter than I’ve ever been to the point where it might be an issue. He’s never said as much or said anything even slightly derogatory to me about it. Honestly I get rather lubricated without him even touching me sometimes. I’ve had the opposite problem before with a previous partner but never too much lubrication. Anyway is this normal?? Is there anything I can do??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
