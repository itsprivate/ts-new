They seem more interested and understanding on a variety of topics, and I can keep the convo going. I’m also a little more emotional than a typical dude so I feel more accepted when in the company of gay men and can talk about my feelings—sometimes with straight dudes it’s like I’m talking to a brick wall. Or so I’ve been told this makes me seem gay? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can hardly ever get my straight friends to hangout. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to lead any gay men on, and being called gay doesn’t offend me however I’m not gay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if anyone disrespects my gay homies I will have a word with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like people don’t know what to do with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
