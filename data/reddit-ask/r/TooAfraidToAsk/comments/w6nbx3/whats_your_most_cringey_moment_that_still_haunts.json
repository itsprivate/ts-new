I saw this girl sitting alone at a table and I went and joined her (I am not really good at talking to girls generally). But that day I decided to overcome my social anxiety and went ahead a started a conversation. I then offered to buy her a drink (soda). She said she&amp;#39;s okay and I misunderstood her and went ahead to get some drinks. I came back and she looked at me, confused. She then excused herself and left saying she had something else to do. I, then, remained there standing like a fucking clown with two sodas in my hand. I don&amp;#39;t think anyone saw it but everytime I think about it it just breaks my heart. I must be the weirdest guys she&amp;#39;s ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
