One thing that I always was taught was how strong our democracy was. Our democracy is what made us great. I cant help but feel like when a substantial portion of the country believes in a lie about an election with zero evidence, we are in trouble. I cant help but feel like this extremely radical supreme court is going to allow state legislatures to have complete control over elections. I cant help but feel like republican voters will go along with all of this because they have been so programmed to defeat the democrats at any cost. It makes me think there HAS to be something going on behind the curtain to prevent this. This is the United States Government. Does Biden/Garland/dems in congress have a plan to save our democracy? Am I being irrational?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
