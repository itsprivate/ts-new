She was wearing a mask, but I thought she had the sweetest eyes and personality, so I struck up a conversation. Next thing I know she&#39;s asking for my number and we set up a date a week or so later to go bowling with a bunch of my friends. The good thing was that we had great chemistry and seemed to be really compatible, but every single one of my friends (myself included) thought that she looked underage.</p>\n\n<p>While I wasn&#39;t physically attracted to her (i&#39;ve always dated older girls), I&#39;ve been trying to focus less on physical appearance and more on actual compatibility because all of my past relationships ended badly due to the fact that I prioritized looks over everything.</p>\n\n<p>After hanging out a second time, I&#39;m realizing we just mesh really well. We have similar goals and lifestyles and everything just seemed to &quot;work&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So she came by the house and even my mom was like how old is she? Did she graduate high school? Which made it pretty clear that she was uncomfortable with her looking so young. So i&#39;m really at a cross roads here. On one end I&#39;m really falling for her and can see a future with her, but on the other end it feels kinda wrong to be with her based on the response from family and friends.</p>\n\n<p>For reference I do also look young myself. People often think I&#39;m 19.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
