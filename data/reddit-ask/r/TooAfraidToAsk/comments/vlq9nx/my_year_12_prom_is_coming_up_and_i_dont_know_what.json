Of course, I said yes which is awesome but I didn&amp;#39;t really think much about the prom beforehand. Most of my friends weren&amp;#39;t going so I just thought there was no reason to go and called it off, so there&amp;#39;s been a change in plans for the prom which will most likely take place around 4 months from now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I grew up and still am currently not in the greatest living situation, and so I&amp;#39;ve never really been to any formal event, never wore anything fancy, never been in a nice car (that my date has), and for the most part, speak with a lot of slang and can sometimes get a little bit defensive when put in an uncomfortable situation. I&amp;#39;m usually very passive it&amp;#39;s just when anxiety gets to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with this being said I really want to try for the sake of my date having a really awesome night but I have no clue where to start or what the fuck to even do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can save up some money in the meantime with work but I&amp;#39;m definitely not rich at all. Everyone kinda talking about all the expensive shit they&amp;#39;re wearing, ladies doing their makeup, and everything, apparently there&amp;#39;s some kind of theme or something but it doesn&amp;#39;t apply to the students? It honestly just a whole lot to wrap my head around especially seen as this is something that I&amp;#39;m hugely uncomfortable with and have never done before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of dumb things in life, but I&amp;#39;ve never been this scared, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just really want this to go well so if anyone got any advice can you let me know? Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
