I like older men and so many other girls aren&amp;#39;t afraid to say it either so it&amp;#39;s kind of insulting when society believes that because im younger than my man I&amp;#39;m somehow being abused or was groomed and not an adult who made the conscious choice to pursue and date this man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or when there is a small problem in the relationship and the guy is more than 5 years older. He automatically groomed her and is abusive just because of the age gap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However when the elder in a relationship is a women its smiled on or completely overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: not looking for any hate. It&amp;#39;s just an interesting observation for me that I wanted opinions on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
