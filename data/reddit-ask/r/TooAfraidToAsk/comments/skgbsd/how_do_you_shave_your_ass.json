How do you know that you&amp;#39;re shaving in the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; places when you can&amp;#39;t see anything? Do you put some kind of mirror or?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many questions I&amp;#39;m just so unsure of. If you have any tips for this embarrassing question, that would be helpful. &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m 17y male btw.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Thanks for all answers. I think the conclusion is that I shouldn&amp;#39;t shave my ass. Thank you. Now, please don&amp;#39;t upvote this embarrassing question any further. I don&amp;#39;t want it to go further up this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Please, no more upvotes. I never wanted this embarrassing post to get this attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
