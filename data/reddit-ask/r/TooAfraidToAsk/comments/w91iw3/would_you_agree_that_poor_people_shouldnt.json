There are so many programs that help underserved families. Imagine thinking that people don&amp;#39;t deserve a family because of their income. People (mostly right wing folks/republicans) are mad that their taxes go towards people in need when billionaires get bailouts (they are the true welfare queens) and pay hardworking people like me very little in wages. The minimum wage has not kept up with inflation and that is the issue. Like Bernie Sanders said, nobody working full time should live in poverty. Housing, food and having a family shouldn&amp;#39;t just be reserved for the middle class. That&amp;#39;s CLASSISM. Poor people deserve families too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
