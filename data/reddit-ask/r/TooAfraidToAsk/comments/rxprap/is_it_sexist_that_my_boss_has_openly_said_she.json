My boss has clearly stated that she will only hire women for diversity/equality reasons. I didn’t have an issue with that but in the last 3 years I have watched her pass over more qualified men who have put more time in than the women who were hired. She has been hiring women with little to no experience over men with a lot of experience. Isn’t this some kind of reverse sexism?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FYI. I am not one of those who were overlooked. Still I am anticipating some accusations of misogyny due to asking this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes I realize that this happened/happens to women as well. I’m not downplaying that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
