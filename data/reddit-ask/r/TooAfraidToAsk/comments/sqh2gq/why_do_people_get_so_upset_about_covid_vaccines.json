Specifically, there have been vaccine requirements to attend school, etc., for a long time, so why is the COVID vaccine requirement different (more upsetting)? And why are people upset about being required to wear something on their face but not upset about being required to wear something on other parts of their bodies?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: thanks for your responses guys! I need to get some sleep but appreciate the discourse and look forward to more in the morning&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
