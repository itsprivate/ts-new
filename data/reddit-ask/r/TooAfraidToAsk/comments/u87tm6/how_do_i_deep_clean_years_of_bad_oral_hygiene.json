My mouth is in a bad state, my teeth aren’t bad looking but it’s over all just very dirty. Especially my tongue&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a tongue scraper and special toothpaste and mouth wash but it still just isn’t doing too much. I need to just deep clean my mouth so I can get into a good routine, what else can I do? Be kind please this is a big insecurity of mine if you couldn’t tell lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: alright I’ll take your advice thank you, it’s embarrassing but it’s the best choice. I’ll book an appointment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
