Had two kids And since they were born it has been uncomfortable for her to be intimate. Because of that we have only been intimate a handful of times in the 3 and 1/2 years since she got pregnant. She knows that intimacy is important for me as it is my love language (physical touch) (hers is acts of service) Tonight we were having an argument as she was expounding on how painful it was for her and somehow came out with &amp;quot;just go find it somewhere else&amp;quot; I asked her &amp;quot;Are you telling me to go f*** somebody else?&amp;quot; She said yes since that&amp;#39;s what you need....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  I had to pick up my jaw off the floor, I was so very shocked. All I want is for her to touch me hold my hand shoulder etc. All she wants is help her on the house My problem is things don&amp;#39;t exist for me unless they are pointed out or it becomes a routine for me. ADD or ADHD (I&amp;#39;m not diagnosed but the signs are there) whatever it is causes me to not think about it for weeks at a time. I only do my laundry because I&amp;#39;ve run out of shirts or pants. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Married folks out there wtf am I supposed to do? ADHD ADD etc folks out there how do I cope with this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
