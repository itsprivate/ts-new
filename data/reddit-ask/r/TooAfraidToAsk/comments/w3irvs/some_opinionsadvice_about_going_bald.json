I wear hats all the time in all public places because my hairline...well I don&amp;#39;t wanna talk about it. But its really embarassing when anyone sees my hair the way it is. The boys too like to make fun of it and it makes me feel really bad. I have a beard though...I don&amp;#39;t know if it makes up for it. Sometimes it feels like hair is migrating from my head to my cheeks and chin.\nI would also like to hear what girls think about stuff like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you all so much for the kind advice. I am definitely shaving my head bald and leaving the beard. It&amp;#39;s a good beard. I am now confident I am definitely owning the new look. Thank y&amp;#39;all so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
