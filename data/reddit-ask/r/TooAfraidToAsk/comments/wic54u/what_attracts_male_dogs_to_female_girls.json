Is it because some sort of hormone or completely random and im just unlucky? this has happened multiple times even when im with a group of girls, the dog always come to me. I usually just laugh it off, but It gets a lot embarrassing when guys are around too. My friends are starting to notice too, one of them asked me why dogs seem to always want to eat you, what you got down there? Is there something I can do to avoid this? Lately, even being around dogs start to give me panic attacks. I do notice that this doesnt happen when I am on jeans, But its not also not realistic to always be on jeans, I dont find jeans comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
