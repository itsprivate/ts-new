To all the German speakers, Just fucking read this crap:\n&amp;quot;Spermaklo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Jungfotze&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Arschfotze&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Abmelken&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hab Bock zu sexeln&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who unironically talks like that?\nAnd yes, this is all Shit I have seen myself first or second hand.\nY&amp;#39;all make fun of Indians with the whole &amp;quot;Show Bobs and vagene&amp;quot; shit, but guys here are not better&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have not witnessed one time where a woman talks like that. Even If they do it for Money it&amp;#39;s rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: To those who downvote me or don&amp;#39;t believe me: Just go spent some time on gay hook-ups Apps. Or ask your female Friends If you can take a peek into their DMs.\nI honestly feel like some of y&amp;#39;all are just feeling exposed.\nAnd it makes perfect Sense. I totally expect people who say this unironically to chill out at reddit.\nSo to all you downvoters: suck my dick&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also on a another note: Just because YOU don&amp;#39;t hear stuff Like this, doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not happening.\nFucking reddit is such a pile of crap man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and on a third note: Why the fuck you take everything the wrong way? These are just some random ass examples I could remember. These are neither the &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; expressions, nor does everybody say all of them. It&amp;#39;s just some fucking examples. Of course they&amp;#39;re oddly specific. This is part of why it&amp;#39;s so stupid.\nI can&amp;#39;t believe that I have to explain this. Fuck man, redditors are so dumb holy shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aight imma head out now, this is getting to stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
