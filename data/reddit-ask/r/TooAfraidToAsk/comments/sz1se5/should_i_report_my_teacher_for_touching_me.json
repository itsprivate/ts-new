She winks at me and me only, she tells me how handsome I am, tells me how much she missed me on the days I’m absent. Today was different, she walked up to me and said that we can “talk” privately anytime I need emotional support…? Then she started rubbing my shoulder and back with her nails. It made me really uncomfortable and she keeps winking at me everyday I’m there. I’m too embarrassed to say anything and I don’t know what to do. I’m a male and I’m 17, I’m too afraid people will think I’m lying or shake it off as a story to get me out of school. She pulls me out of class a lot too so she can do “mental health checks” but only compliments and winks at me. What do I do???&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
