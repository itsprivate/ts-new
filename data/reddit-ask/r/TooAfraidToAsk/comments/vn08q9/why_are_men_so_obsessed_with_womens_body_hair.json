I can understand having certain preferences in a partner but why should someone need to be hairless anywhere? If a woman shaves because she wants to and it makes her feel better, awesome. But why does anyone care if she&amp;#39;s got hair in her armpits or around her privates, as long as it&amp;#39;s not interfering with whatever activities may take place?&lt;br/&gt;\nI know &amp;quot;not all men&amp;quot; and all that, but I&amp;#39;m clueless as to why anyone cares. I&amp;#39;m familiar with the history behind women shaving, but I&amp;#39;m asking why people care NOW.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: For clarity, I&amp;#39;m not asking why people prefer well-groomed genitals. I get that. I&amp;#39;m asking about armpit hair, arm hair, stomach hair, and hair around the boobs or on the back, and I&amp;#39;m asking why some men feel the need to police their partner&amp;#39;s shaving habits. If it&amp;#39;s not comfortable for her and it&amp;#39;s not interfering with anything, who cares? &amp;quot;It turns me off&amp;quot; technically answers the question, but I&amp;#39;m asking if there&amp;#39;s a reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
