Now, I realize that women have the right to wear whatever the heck they want. But I saw this cringy-ass Twitter post that made me re-evaluate my feminism. It goes:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Everyone wants to talk about Muslim countries that enforce hijab.</p>\n\n<p>Western countries that force women to TAKE OFF hijab is not only the same form of control, but worse: it’s systemic anti-Muslim hate. </p>\n\n<p>Forcing minor girls from a vulnerable minority to reveal their bodies is SICK&quot;</p>\n\n<p>First of all, what the fuck? Since when are minors who &quot;reveal&quot; their bodies sickening? It&#39;s called wearing comfortable clothes. Is that what she can only think of when it comes to wearing anything BUT hijab? Does she sexualize every single minor girl she sees? Classic Muslim idiocy, and yes, she definitely does. She&#39;s the sick one.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, how could she even DARE say a country that gives women their rights on a silver platter like France, NOT ONLY COMPARES, but IS WORSE than fucking Saudi Arabia! This is the most idiotic, the most absurd argument ever I&#39;ve seen. </p>\n\n<p>Third, she wasn&#39;t even fucking talking about banning hijab for every Muslim women. It was only banned for those who are under 18. I have a problem with this as well. I don&#39;t think parents have the right to shove their beliefs on their children&#39;s throats like that in the 21st century. It&#39;s called secularism, and I&#39;m dumbfounded by a so-called leftist who&#39;s so against it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll be real. Give her kind the right to vote, and France, a beautiful and free country, will become a shithole Islamic emirate. I won&#39;t stop until they stop being so fundamentalist with their views.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
