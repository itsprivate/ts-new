Break up with them or divorce them! They must HATE you! Parent doesn’t let their child have a certain hairstyle or approve of their clothing choices for whatever reason? Parent is abusive! Go no contact once you’re 18 and consider calling CPS! A friend says one thing you don’t like?

I got off Twitter for reasons like this just for it to be just as bad (if not worse) on Reddit! Also, not completely against it, sometimes it brings a good laugh! I want to hear what y’all think. Or if you want to troll me I’ll take that as well lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
