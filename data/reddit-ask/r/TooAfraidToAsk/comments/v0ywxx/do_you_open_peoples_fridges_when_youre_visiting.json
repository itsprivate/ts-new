The first time she did this, I was a bit shocked because honestly I thought it was a sign of lack of manners. Likewise, any time I&amp;#39;m at her place, and I&amp;#39;m hungry, she orders me to search her fridge, which is always a little odd for me given my upbringing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Were you guys taught the same thing growing up? Or, do you have no issues searching people&amp;#39;s fridges?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
