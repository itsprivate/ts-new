I’ve never had a girl like me and I’m still a virgin at 21 both of these make me feel awful about myself. I wouldn’t say that I hate women on the level of other incels, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t often feel resentment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find myself wondering why I can’t just be a chad and why women are so shallow when I know that’s not exactly rational. I have really shitty self esteem, and have been shown and in some cases have sought out incel beliefs. I’ve looked through incel forums since I was 14.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I constantly see confirmation of things about women I’ve read online through the girls around me. Specifically in my close female friends and female bullies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don’t want to be an incel but I feel myself sliding on a slippery slope to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I not be one?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
