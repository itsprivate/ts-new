I guess rereading the post I’d made after staying up until 6am, I didn’t make that very clear haha 😭🤧. I’m asking about where to go instead of staying here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of posts I’ve seen and a lot of comments I have read vouch for a lot of countries to live in that aren’t America. Pretty much everyone is quick to point out how much of a cesspool America can be with their backwards ass health care system, broken and corrupt banking firms, predatory student loans, and the whole lot. Basically summarizing that America’s economy leaves no room to grow wealth. \nWhich brings me to the question in the title. If not America, then where? Where do I go to? My plan is to leave after college, but I now have to go sooner. Where can I go with no family, hardly any money to my name, and nothing but the clothes on my back to start a new life somewhere else that genuinely cares about the people who live there?\nI’m not saying America is completely 100% terrible, it’s just not for me. \nPlease help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
