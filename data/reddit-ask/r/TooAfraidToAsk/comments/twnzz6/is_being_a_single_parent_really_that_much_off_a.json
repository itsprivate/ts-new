I haven’t (really) tried to get back into the dating scene recently, but when I have in the past I was brushed off a LOT because I have kids. No that’s fine. I understand a lot of people don’t want kids and a lot of people don’t want to date people with kids. I get it and don’t lose any sleep over it. But overall is it really THAT much of a deal breaker? My kids are an extension of myself and there is NO way I’d ever be with someone who didn’t want them I. Their life as well. But with that, I’m worried it’s going to be if I ever try to seriously meet someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Forgot to state age.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
