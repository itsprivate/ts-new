I do not believe funding or time is being spent to actually further the ENTIRE black community but only make a very small percentage richer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im tired of the organizations saying their goal is to help black people but will give us half-assed effort when Lord knows we need in depth reform and assistance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of hearing, “Hey guys just go to college, pick what sounds fun, and you’ll be good” while they should say “Pick what makes money so your family has a damn chance m’fcker”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of them throwing top d$llar festivals while the people who live in these neighborhoods that they throw things in never received any MONEY or GOOD advice on how to move up the social ladder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They keep pushing this image of black excellence meaning that you spend excessive amounts of money on STUFF or degrees one doesn’t need, while Lord please tell these people to SAVE every dollar they have for their futures to either invest, start a business, or have some chance at retirement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why aren’t they instilling the importance of HOMES WITHOUT FATHERS AS NOT NORMAL. Why aren’t they instilling the importance of FAMILY. Why aren’t they instilling the importance COMMUNITY VALUES. EDUCATION. EFFICIENT FINANCIAL LITERACY. NUTRITION. COMMON CURTESY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they will spend all day educating people on the history of black culture as though its AS important as SURVIVAL and SOCIAL MOBILITY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIZE OF THE HOMES OF THE BLM LEADERS BUT THEIR FOOT SOLIDERS ARE STRUGGLING TO FEED THEMSELVES. EXCUSE ME??? WHAT A DAMN SHAME. THAT IS NOT CHARITY NOR ADVOCACY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[AND I believe the “foundation” has begun to lobby for who donates the MOST— and it was mostly &lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt; donors, most likely due to the white population having more access to funds on average.(Could this mean that whatever the demographic of majority donors are may be “washing” the real message of BLM?— aka the leaders of the foundation do whatever the majority says to do)]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do BLM? Yes, but this organization DOES NOT help black people actually MOVE UPWARDS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donate to the local Boys and Girls Club or just……………give money to people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
