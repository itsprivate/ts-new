My son told his teacher that his dad yells and it&amp;#39;s scary, but the teacher helped my son write out his answer in a much more neutral way.  I found out what was said by talking to him about his answer. The truth is, he&amp;#39;s right. But he&amp;#39;s also safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I reach out to the teacher and let her know I spoke to my son about this, and I&amp;#39;m addressing the situation? Or does that make it sound like I&amp;#39;m getting defensive and she should call CPS? This teacher is amazing, passionate, and loves her students deeply - I don&amp;#39;t want her worrying. I&amp;#39;m embarrassed and worried, but I&amp;#39;m planning to talk to my husband about this as soon as possible. It&amp;#39;s going to kill him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
