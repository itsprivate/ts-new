But Israel gets millions, if not billions of dollars despite what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: I am not supporting either side or any side, but it’s harsh to see the Palestinian and Yemeni genocide, and nothing has been done to the Saudis nor Israelis, yet the amount of support for Ukraine has been outstanding (which is great, but yeah).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 3: I’m not referring to the citizens of the Western nations, but to their powers. And i’m not referring only to the US, because even the EU - where i’m from - hasn’t done anything either (and has even supported several genocides across the Middle East)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
