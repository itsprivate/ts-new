And it isn&amp;#39;t like a deja vu feeling, I legit remember having the dream in the same setting, same people etc but kind of continuing from where it had stopped. I believe it&amp;#39;s not a common thing because most people I know don&amp;#39;t even remember if they had dreams during the night, so I&amp;#39;m very intrigued about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
