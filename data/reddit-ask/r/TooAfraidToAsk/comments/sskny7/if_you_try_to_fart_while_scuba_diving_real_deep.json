So your farts can overcome the water pressure and release. But if you are scuba diving 40-50 ft under water, and you tried to fart, that&amp;#39;s around 20 PSI. No way you can generate that kind of pressure using your muscles. So would sea water then rush in if you attempted it? I know it doesn&amp;#39;t happen in your other end because you are filling up your lungs with compressed air, but your farts don&amp;#39;t have such an advantage (unless you use your regulator incorrectly).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
