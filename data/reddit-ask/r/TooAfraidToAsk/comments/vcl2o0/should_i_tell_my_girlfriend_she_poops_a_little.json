  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I’ve done some research and apparently positions with like a lot of pressure on the abdomen at the same time as like a lot of pleasure, your body is relaxed while also being pushed on…great combo for a little bit of poo to come out. I want to tell her but I think she’d be mortified, but idk if it’s like she knows she’s doing it? Or maybe she doesn’t realize? Maybe she’s had to poop every single times she’s come over and just held it?? It makes no sense. But it’s happened sometimes in like positions with not a lot of pressure of the stomach/abdomen so idk. My limited reading has said that if it’s regular it could mean some sort of disorder?? I’m also not sure it any is happening to get near/inside her vagina and I don’t want her to end up getting sick or an infection. I’m so sorry if this is gross but I’m more concerned about her health than I am my comfort, truthfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to clarify some things. We’re both 18 and a little more 7 months in the relationship. No, im not gonna dump her because she pooped a couple times. I still love her for her and if I can work this out with her I’d very much like to&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: thanks for all the praise on being a good boyfriend lol, I certainly try to be. To address some common questions and concerns: \nthe shit is like a liquid consistency. It’s not a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t have stomach issues as far as I know of, besides occasionally complaining she’s “really nauseous” but that seems to come and go around the same time as her period. Not to be the guy who immediately points a females problem to her period, but it lines up. I don’t want to piss anyone off with my assumption lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No I cannot smell it, and I can’t speak for her. We both can’t smell because we had COVID over Christmas (very fun) and have yet to get our smell back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes I obviously want to have sex but I’m not going to compromise her health and safety for my own pleasure, so please enough of the “WeLl Do YoU WaNnA HaVe SeX AgAiN?”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
