I don&amp;#39;t wear skirts or dresses or anything that would usually require having underwear on. \nI don&amp;#39;t wear them mainly because I have extremely sensitive skin and when I wear them I get bad rashes from them that can get pretty painful.\nI also just don&amp;#39;t understand the point. I feel like it&amp;#39;s just an other pair of pants underneath your pants.\nShould I be wearing them, and is it safe to not wear them?
