Nobody has ever done anything really nice for me, surprised me, or ever really gone out of their way for me. I had 2 birthday parties total when I was a kid because my birthday was so close to Christmas that my parents always said it was too hard to do something. Once my dad went out to lunch with his friends on my birthday and didn’t even invite me, just left me home alone. I never had a graduation party for high school or college, nobody even went to my college graduation. I had to throw and pay for everything for my own baby shower. Never had anyone get me an extravagant gift or leave a surprise in my car while I was working. Never had anyone give me a crazy huge tip at work, although I have received some generous tips. I constantly do things for the people around me to feel special because I secretly wish somebody would do that for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do you not think about it or reframe it in a way that doesn’t make you feel bad?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
