Specifically innocent fun? Throwing popcorn at each other and laughing till it hurts.  Playing board games or card games until you can’t keep your eyes open anymore.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t have kids so I do recognize that I have more flexibility in my personal life then others but having connections and good relationships with your friends should still be important, no?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
