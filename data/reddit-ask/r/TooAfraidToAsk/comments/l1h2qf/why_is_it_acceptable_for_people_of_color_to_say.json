The post has thousands of likes and lots of other black users commenting similar things about how they’ll only date black women. </p>\n\n<p>Now imagine if a white man posted “how I like my women” along with a picture of a white woman or something. That post would immediately be called out as racist, and rightfully so.</p>\n\n<p>But what’s the difference here? Why is one acceptable and the other not instead of both being called out? Why is it okay for POC to blatantly state they choose partners based on skin color instead of that being deemed racist? This is similar to how it feels like a double standard that it’s perfectly okay for POC to make jokes about white teenage boys being mass shooters, but if a white person made a joke about a middle eastern kid being a terrorist they’re immediately racist.</p>\n\n<p>I get that sometimes humor is cathartic, but there’s a line between that and being racist. Again, I don’t think white people should be able to say these things at all, I’m just saying that I don’t understand why we don’t also condemn the same type of behavior from POC.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
