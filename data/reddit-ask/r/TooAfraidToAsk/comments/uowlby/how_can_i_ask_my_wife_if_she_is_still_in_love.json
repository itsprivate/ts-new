We have 3 kids together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am still madly in love with with, I still love her deeply. But as of recently she has had a new obsession that seems to have replaced her love and affection, and mental energy towards our relationship her words exactly being “I don’t have the mental energy to put towards US, because I spread it towards the boys and myself” and to note she doesn’t work so there isn’t mental energy going that way. But me, I give my all to work, our boys, hers and my parents (as we live with hers), and her. But not getting that level of appreciation has really taken a toll mentally and emotionally on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve expressed this MANY times, expressed how I felt and been met with “what am I supposed to do about that?” Which I thought was pretty self explanatory tbh&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But frankly Idk what or how to ask “are you still IN love with me?” Because I know she loves me, but I don’t feel IN love with. And tbh I’d feel better knowing it, aside from being dragged thru the ringer like I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
