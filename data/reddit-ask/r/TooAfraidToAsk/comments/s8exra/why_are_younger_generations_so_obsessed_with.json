  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a couple of days ago my gf got this message from one of our younger friends. She&amp;#39;s around 21, we are 26. This friend was trying to convince my gf that she can be bisexual without actually having done anything with another girl, &amp;quot;just checking girls out is enough&amp;quot; she sais, so my gf should just claim being bisexual. What she didn&amp;#39;t knew is that my gf already is bi and had a relationship with another girl, but she keeps it private, not telling everybody, because she sees no point in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we laughed at her attempt to explain bisexuality this question just popped into my head. Why do people, younger generations especially, feel the need to broadcast their sexual orientation so much, to the point where it&amp;#39;s starting to look more like a religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give you an example. This girl went to a new years eve party with her bf. The party Whatsapp group had the name new years eve gay edition and the description read: every straight person discovered will be kicked out. So she got her bf to pretend that he&amp;#39;s bi as well. Is the sexual orientation the new music genre debate? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 15 people were split up into music genres, that was their core component that made up a big chunk of their personalities. Is the same thing happening nowadays with sexual orientations? I am aware of the fact that some people really are bi or gay etc, I&amp;#39;m talking about only a segment of the lgbtq community. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again I&amp;#39;m not trying to downplay sexual orientations, but just SAYING that you&amp;#39;re bi, to me seems exactly as easy as saying you listen to x genre and &lt;em&gt;poof&lt;/em&gt; there you have it, a crowd of people just like you (based only on sexual orientation) ready to accept you for who you &amp;quot;truly&amp;quot; are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
