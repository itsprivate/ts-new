My sister (f16) and brother (m15) have both been addicted to weed for over a year now. For the most part I mind my business. My father is aware of their addiction to weed but has absolutely no control of them. They do whatever they please despite anything he says because they never had consequences throughout life. So now they are addicted to weed and the pills which are both illegal where we live. I’m very worried because they are young. I’m aware my father might not even be able to do anything about it but I just want them to get help or try to stop. Should I say something to them or my father or should I just mind my business? Either way when/if it gets found out it’s likely that the blame will fall on me because I’m the oldest and my father does it all the time because I’m the only one who truly has a sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
