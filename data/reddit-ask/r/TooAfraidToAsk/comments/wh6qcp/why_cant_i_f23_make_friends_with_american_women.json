Basically, none of the girls I come across seem to like me. I’m not sure whether this is some kind of cultural divide but it kinda sucks as I place a lot of value on female friendships. Not that I’m looking for any BFFs necessarily. I just would prefer a bit of a mixed group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I have been in this position before. In my younger years, I was bullied by the mean girls and almost all of my friends were guys. However, this changed when I first went to uni in the UK to study for my undergrad. For the first time in my life, I had some women I could hang out and do stuff with. I figured I had just had a bad experience at school and that making girlfriends as an adult would be much easier moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I feel like I am being dragged back to some super awkward and disheartening times I was hoping to forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think the problem is? And what can I do to alleviate it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
