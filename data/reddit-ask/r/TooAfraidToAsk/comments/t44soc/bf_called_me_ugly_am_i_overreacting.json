I’m not wearing makeup and he is in the middle of putting his hat on. But we are both laughing and look so happy I really wanted to share the moment. After he woke up and saw it he got mad at me and said it’s such a bad photo. But what hurt me is after he said, you look ugly- look at how much you are smiling. I deleted it but I’m hurt by this. Is this justified or am I overreacting?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
