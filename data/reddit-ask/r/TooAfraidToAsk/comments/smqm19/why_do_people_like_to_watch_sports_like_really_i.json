There is a massive disconnect, most games go a long time, and there is just extreme levels of fandom and nationalism that freaks me out, I know how  baseball is played, but only know the basics of most other sports. I love video games, and have even played competitively with tabletop games like Magic The Gathering. Yet, sports… confound me completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to say they are bad, or troll anyone here (it’s just that I personally don’t like it but want to understand too), but I would legit like to know what the appeal is, why you watch, and what you find so enthralling. Am I missing something? Maybe it is just me, but I would still like to know why OTHERS enjoy it so much,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
