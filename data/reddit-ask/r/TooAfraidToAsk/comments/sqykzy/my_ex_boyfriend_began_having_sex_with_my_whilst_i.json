Around 2am I fell asleep and I woke up at some point during the night to him having sex with me. He had taken my clothes off me whilst I was sleeping. I told him to stop and he did but he wouldn&amp;#39;t get off me and kept trying to put it back in. After about 10 minutes of him continously trying to convince to let him have sex with me he finally got off of me. I fell back asleep and when I woke up in the morning he was naked and had put his erect penis between my thighs and was humping against me.\nIs this rape?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
