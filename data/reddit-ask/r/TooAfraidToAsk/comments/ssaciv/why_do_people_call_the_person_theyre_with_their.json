When someone saids their partner, I immediately think of a business partner and not the relationship the person may be in. So what changed the usage of the word? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course for the gay community, I would imagine it would be easier to just use the term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; instead of outright saying the terminology of the person you are with, and signifying it to be a same sex relationship in which I would imagine areas deeply rooted in prejudice would have more of an issue with upon knowing. But I am curious of what changed the overall lack of usage of conventional terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
