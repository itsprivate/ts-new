  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in Finland, and i&amp;#39;ve been unemployed nearly 10 years (altough i worked for 2 years between).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I live in a new apartment house (built in 2018). 60 square meters, two rooms, everything new. My rent is 800 euros and that includes sauna, 50mb internet (i pay 20 euros extra for 600mb), laundry room, apartment led lightings. Area is nice, lot of nature and big shopping mall only 1km walk. Helsinki (our capital is only 20 min train ride. You can go anywhere using public transport, so no car needed, I sometimes rent a car for day or weekend to go for fishing or camping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get enough money from the government to pay my rent and utilities, and after that i have over 700 euros left for the month. I can save usually 100-150 euros, so every 2 years i can make a bigger purchase and go on a holiday to Thailand or wherever i want. I make all my meals myself so that saves a lot of money. And i fish alot, pick berries and mushrooms at fall. Usually i have over 20 kilos of fish in the freezer when winter starts. Lot of berries and mushrooms too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Point is, that I feel the best way to reduce crime is to provide decent living conditions for those who are unfortunate and cant work for any reason.  And we have free health care too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear other peoples experiences around the world. I know i&amp;#39;m lucky, I just hope other countries will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: We also have some oblications you have to meet to receive benefits. Like you have to be listed as a unemployed in gov&amp;#39;s system that offers jobs to people. They also sometimes make you go on training courses or similar. But basically its not so bad. You can pretty much stay unemployed if you want, and still live pretty comfy life. Not many want that though, they want more materia, bigger house etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
