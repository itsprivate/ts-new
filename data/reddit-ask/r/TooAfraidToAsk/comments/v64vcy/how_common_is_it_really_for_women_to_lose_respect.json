I see this all over reddit. Anytime the topic of men showing emotion comes up, there will inevitably be a highly upvoted comment about how when they tried being open, their partner got uncomfortable, so now they don&amp;#39;t open up anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t really picture many situations where I&amp;#39;d react aversly to someone of either gender opening up to me about their feelings. The only instances I can imagine are something like if they are clearly in the wrong and using crocodile tears to avoid accountability, but other than that, it&amp;#39;s a given I&amp;#39;d be supportive. I&amp;#39;ve comforted people of either gender whenever they seemed to need it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people here have said that EVERY partner has lost respect for them after opening up. I get having that experience with one or 2 emotionally stunted women but EVERY partner? Is it so common that some people experience it with 10 women in a row? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just curious about an estimate on just how common this is because it&amp;#39;s an extremely common talking point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
