I am friendly with this younger guy in his early 20s who is a courier that comes to my job once a week. It seems that he&amp;#39;s been flirting and hanging out longer to chat with me and just last week asked me if I was interested in going to a concert with him. He thought I was in my late 20s but didn&amp;#39;t seem phased when I told him my age. He&amp;#39;s smart and cute and just graduated college, pretty shy too and seems like a really nice kid and I just feel I&amp;#39;d be too old for him and mess him up emotionally. It&amp;#39;s possible he just wants to &amp;quot;hang out&amp;quot; but he could have asked anyone around his age instead and it&amp;#39;s a band that is more popular for his age group. I&amp;#39;m by no means an old lady but I have a much different life but I&amp;#39;m stable and happy. I don&amp;#39;t view him as a child or kid but I feel we won&amp;#39;t have much in common and he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be the booty call kind of guy. Should I politely decline or go with it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forgot to add since it was asked, he is aware I have kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
