I do NOT want to be fat, in any circumstance. My brother is 7 years smaller than me, but has the same weight as me, and he can&amp;#39;t run properly without falling. It scares me enough to motivate me to go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also another question: What would be the best exercise for me, as the gym next to me doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of equipment. It has a treadmill, 2 cycling things( one which moves your hand as well, and one that just moves your legs), the thing which you pull down at different weights as per your choice, and something ehich you push with your legs(same as the one with your hands)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m extremely sorry if I couldn&amp;#39;t explain things well, I&amp;#39;m not too learned about gym equipment and stuff, and english isn&amp;#39;t my first language. Also, sorry if this question doesn&amp;#39;t fit this sub, I couldn&amp;#39;t find any other. Good evening!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
