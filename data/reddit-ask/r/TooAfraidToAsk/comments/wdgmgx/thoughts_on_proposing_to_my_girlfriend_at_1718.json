We both know everythkng about each pther and I love her to death. We&amp;#39;re incredibmy close. To me she IS the one. She has to go through some (kinda serious) mental health issues and I offer her my support in each and every way I can. I have to admit that sometimes it can be a little exhausting but I feel like I wanna keep going and care for her all my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re planning on sharing a home after high school during our studies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My idea was to propose to her next summer (she just celebrated her 17th birthday and i&amp;#39;m almsot 17 as well) so she&amp;#39;ll be around 18 and I&amp;#39;ll be 17.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had a similar experience ? Would you have any piece of advice or do you think I should reconsider based on some other factors ? It would be amazing to hear from someone who proposed at around my age&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
