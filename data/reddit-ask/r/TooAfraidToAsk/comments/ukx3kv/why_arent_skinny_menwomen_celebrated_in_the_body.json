What about larger men, short men, people with scars and deformities, they aren&amp;#39;t celebrated or represented in this either and it does damage them also. I&amp;#39;d like to hear opinions on this too.... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not just skinny slim men/women, why are there no dad bods, larger men and people with scars etc. \nAs a naturally tall skinny/slim woman I don&amp;#39;t understand why only larger obese women are celebrated. And why can larger women make comments on my body, eg I&amp;#39;ve lost count the amount of times I have been told my legs look like twigs or sticks, my wrists are too thin or I need to eat more and I&amp;#39;m meant to shut up and put up. But if I said their legs look like trees trunks or called them fat for example, I&amp;#39;d be told I&amp;#39;m wrong and not body positive, why the double standards? If we really are going to be body positive, it needs to be an all inclusive movement or not !!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
