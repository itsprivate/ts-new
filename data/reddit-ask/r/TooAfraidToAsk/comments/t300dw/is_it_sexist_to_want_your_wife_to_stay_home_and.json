Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: thank you redditors for your answers. It’s definitely helped change my outlook on things a lot. I really don’t think it’s fair to have another adult completely financially dependent on me. I also have come to realize that it is a job to take care of kids or manage a home. I am still young and have a lot of thinking to do. Thanks for your help. I am going to sleep now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
