And they ask the weirdest questions too like &amp;quot;IF GOD IS REAL WHY DOESN&amp;#39;T SQUIDWARD WALK ON WATER&amp;quot; idk bruh, you&amp;#39;re an atheist the answer to the question is simple &amp;quot;God doesn&amp;#39;t exist&amp;quot; moving on.  Some of these reddit atheist lowkey sound like Christians that are mad at God or smth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like they sometime make a big deal out of the smallest things, who cares if someone says &lt;strong&gt;God Bless you,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ll Pray for you.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes its their way of showing affection, not everyone is out to make you uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My last and final point, whenever people ask questions about God there&amp;#39;s always that one person in the comments ready for a debate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some examples I found on the beloved atheism subreddit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: these were the few irrational post I found out, most were pretty normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;People saying “Look at god” or “god is good” when someone survives a car crash is cringe&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religions and religious people should be dealt with the same way we deal with antivaxxers and conspirations&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that religion has caused some people a great deal of pain, but its also helped others. I feel like we generalize and judge people too much. If you don&amp;#39;t believe in God cool beans, If you do believe in God, good for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
