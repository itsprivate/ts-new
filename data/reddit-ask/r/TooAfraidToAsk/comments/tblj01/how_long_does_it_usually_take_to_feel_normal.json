I thought I&amp;#39;d get plastic surgery, recover for a bit and done. I got one emergency surgery and now I go for visits every month or 2, just to hear that it&amp;#39;s healing great and they&amp;#39;ll see me in another 1-2 months for another checkup. My next visit is coming up and I&amp;#39;m anxious. Every visit I get my hopes up for surgery that can&amp;#39;t come soon enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to know how long this will take so I can prepare myself mentally. I mean surgery/surgeries, recovery... How long before life can be normal again? Months, a year? Longer?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
