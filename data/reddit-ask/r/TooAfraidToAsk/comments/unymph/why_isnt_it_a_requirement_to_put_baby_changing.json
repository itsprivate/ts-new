It’s constant. Practically everywhere I go, men’s rooms don’t have changing tables. Do these companies just think dads don’t ever go anywhere with kids? Do they just not care about single dads? Sorry to vent, but this seems really thoughtless and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why isn’t it standard to give men’s rooms a changing table? And is there a better way for me to handle this in the future?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
