I believe their relationship is completely platonic but they have a sexual past from years ago. I have no issues with them hanging out but her staying overnight even once in a while is not something I’m comfortable. Is it ok to tell him this and ask him to set a boundary to not allow her to continue this behavior? Or am I ask too much? We have been together 3 months and the idea of having to deal with this would make me even more uncomfortable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
