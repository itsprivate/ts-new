  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am a 30 yr old F, married to a man a year back. I was dating him for a long time but he suddenly fell out of love, 2 MONTHS before  our planned wedding. In his defense, he did tell me this but we come from very traditional family setup so I requested him to marry me anyway because calling the wedding off would have been very damaging to our families. In return for this big favor, he asked me not to divorce him. Ever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, we live together. We both care and respect each other but he doesn&amp;#39;t love me. Him bailing on me after 7 years of seeing each other shook me to the core. I don&amp;#39;t think even I love him anymore. He doesn&amp;#39;t even touch me. So no sex. It feels like a rejection night after night. Plus I think he is having an affair with a lady on the next street.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to be loved. I deserve it, I am a kind human being and circumstances pushed me to this point. I earn my money and am mostly independent. I look after my parents and my in laws. I have a good reputation in his family and mine, but I am lonely. I don&amp;#39;t really have anyone whom I can call mine. How can I help myself?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for grammar errors, if any. English is not my native language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
