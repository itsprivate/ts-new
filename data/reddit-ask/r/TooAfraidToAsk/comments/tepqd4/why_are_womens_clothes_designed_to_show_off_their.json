What human being would?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s that saying that actions speak louder than words though, and as a guy, it looks like every adult woman that&amp;#39;s pre menopause wears clothing that is designed exactly to put their body on display as a sexual object (with the curious exception of lesbians that don&amp;#39;t go for the feminine look).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not talking club wear, or swimsuits, but basic every day casual clothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take the following for example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men&amp;#39;s shorts&lt;/strong&gt;? Wide cut, only touching the skin at the waist and top of the butt, hem at mid thigh to just above the knee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&amp;#39;s shorts&lt;/strong&gt;? Extremely tight cut, touching the skin at every single point, hem right below the crotch or just an inch or two below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men&amp;#39;s t-shirts&lt;/strong&gt;? Generally loose, sleeve hemmed at mid bicep, neck right at the collar bone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&amp;#39;s t-shirts&lt;/strong&gt;? Much tighter, sleeve hemmed much higher up, neck as low as it can get without drawing condemnation from other women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this is just casual clothing that&amp;#39;s worn by both genders. It&amp;#39;s not even getting into athletic clothing, which amps this up to 11.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a guy, short shorts exist, as do tight t-shirts. I don&amp;#39;t need either - or any skin hugging casual clothing, as a matter of fact - to &amp;#39;be comfortable&amp;#39; and I know that wearing either is very much putting my body on display as a sexual object, which I did in the past when I wasn&amp;#39;t in a long term relationship and wanted to draw attention from the opposite sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But from the way women dress, it appears that every piece of clothing (unless you&amp;#39;re a member of the Amish or other hyper-traditional sect) is designed to display the message that I  display when I&amp;#39;m looking to garner attention from the opposite gender that says &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Hey, I&amp;#39;m a healthy adult male and I want non-platonic attention from women.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as soon as women hit menopause? All of those clothing choices start to resemble the casual wear clothing of men. So it&amp;#39;s definitely not a &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;This is how I have to dress for basic human comfort&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39; thing, despite a bunch of words to the contrary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There seems to be this weird double standard of &amp;quot;Pay non-platonic attention to my body, but don&amp;#39;t pay non-platonic attention to my body.&amp;quot; that women seem to be completely blind to in a really strange way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think women are great human beings like men are great human beings, and worthy of the exact same respect you&amp;#39;d give a guy, but they make some strange clothing choices that seem to be contrary to what they say on the subject, and it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve yet to understand, but definitely would appreciate the chance to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
