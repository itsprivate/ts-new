  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently my friend and I have been hanging out (we’re both 20) at his place and he was showing me pics of his recent vacation on his phone. He did that iPhone thing where it auto scrolled across and I saw from the tab bar that he had not only one, but several pics of me on his phone. I noticed they were all pulled from my instagram or pics I personally sent him (just very casual, silly selfies). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seemed super embarrassed and pretended like nothing happened. I asked him to scroll back and he did. I had a look at the pics and there were about 20, including some videos. He was blushing hard and kept saying that “it’s not what it looks like” and that he’s sorry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My pics have been used to catfish on several dating apps in the past so my first thought and fear was that he was using them for the same purposes. He denied it and said that he’d never do that. I asked him if there’s a particular reason he’d have so many of my selfies on his phone. He sighed and just mumbled that he doesn’t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked with my friends about it and they all immediately claimed that he’s obviously masturbating to the pics. My male friends especially insisted on it. \nThere’s so much porn available that I find it kinda hard to believe that a guy would jerk to pics like that (I mean, most of them were of my face, not even full body shots). I personally wouldn’t be able to get off to someone’s face so it’s not something I understand at all. But that’s me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of get having 1 or 2 pics of your friend, but it was a whole bunch. And he’s never indicated that he’s into me. Any thoughts/ideas?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
