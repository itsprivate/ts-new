A few months ago, I noticed the lowest option was 15%. Still, I tipped, because I was brought up to believe that it was rude not to tip. However, last night I was getting my $7 pretzel and $4 Dasani bottle of water at a hockey game and I hit &amp;quot;no tip&amp;quot; for the first time. Why should I have to pay 15% more on already extremely inflated prices? As someone who used to work for tips, I still can&amp;#39;t help but feel like an assh*le.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
