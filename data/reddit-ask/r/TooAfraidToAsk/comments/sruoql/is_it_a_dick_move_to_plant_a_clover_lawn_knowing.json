I want to do this mainly with a clover lawn, with some other flowers and bulbs scattered throughout. I live in a very hot, drought prone area, and the irrigation water is being turned off earlier and earlier every year, which means that many of the lawns around us (with the exception of our next door neighbor) are dry and brown. I think that a clover lawn would solve that problem, and I just think that they&amp;#39;re really neat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The houses to either side of us are rentals. We don&amp;#39;t live in a &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; nice area, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t call it very trashy either. It&amp;#39;s an eclectic mix of people who care a lot about their lawns, and people who don&amp;#39;t care much at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
