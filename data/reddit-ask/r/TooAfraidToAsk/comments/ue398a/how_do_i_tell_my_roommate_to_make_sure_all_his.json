He moved in about 3 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a month ago i took a shower and while i was washing my foot, i saw the stringy cum stuck to it. I shit you not i literally almost vomited in the shower. I let it go because i thought maybe it was a one off situation and also how do i mention that to someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday it happened again. Same exact scenario, start washing my feet and i saw the cum sticking, slightly dangling off the side of my foot. Again this was absolutely revolting i can’t emphasis this enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to have to check and clean the shower EVERY TIME i need to take a shower. How do i ask him, in the least uncomfortable way, to make sure all of his cum is gone before he gets out?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
