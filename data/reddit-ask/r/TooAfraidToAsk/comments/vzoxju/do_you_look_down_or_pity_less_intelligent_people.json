Many things started making sense - my lack of logic, understanding some things etc.. It&amp;#39;s true that people around me are really patient with me and explain stuff, but since finding out I became really self conscious when talking with others - mostly because I feel like they look down on me or pity me, despite the fact that I am doing pretty well for myself - partner, school, job, all that. My question is basically: How do you see people of lower intelligence? Do you have some sort of prejudice against them? When you notice that someone you&amp;#39;re talking with is &amp;quot;slower&amp;quot;, does it turn you off from further conversation?\nEDIT: I think some people in this thread see inteligence kinda different than me? For me it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;empty brain&amp;quot;. Inability to comprehend things people talk about, not being able to remember stuff or perform tasks I learned hours/days ago, taking forever to learn them, not being able to understand how things work despite being explained how they work...I don&amp;#39;t really mean how much someone knows or how educated or well spoken they are, more like when you have to explain something to someone as you would to a child and they&amp;#39;d still wouldn&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
