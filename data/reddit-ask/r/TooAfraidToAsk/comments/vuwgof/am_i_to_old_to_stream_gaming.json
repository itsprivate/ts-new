And twitch has always seem fun, but I feel I was born to late to join in. I&amp;#39;m told I&amp;#39;m funny and witty, and I love to make fun of serious situation, I&amp;#39;ve set up twitch today and was going to go live tonight. But I don&amp;#39;t know guys, am I going to be that old guy trying to be cool? Cause it&amp;#39;s not about that, I just like that I can talk to people about games since all my mates have moved on from it. I&amp;#39;m a dad of 4 and my wife thinks it sounds fun regardless if I get views or what not. Does anyone watch anyone my age or around my age?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
