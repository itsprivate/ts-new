A couple of years ago i noticed that i get turned on by femboy porn while masturbating (anything masculine is a turnoff). Then started to think that i might actually be bisexual. By nature im a very curious person and would always try to get to the bottom of everything so i started thinking of it without actually acting on it. Because The problem with acting on it is that my religion and my society are strictly homophobic, im not that religious but im also not-not religious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 days ago, This feminine guy walked up to me asked for my number. I hesitated, but i gave it to him and we started chatting. He offered me a massage and sex but i was too scared and guilt choked, so i declined and asked him to take it a little slow. Which he did and made it easier for me to balance my curiosity/guilt rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday i had my first Non-heterosexual experience. We met and i was so frustrated I couldn’t look him in the face for the whole time, But we chatted and eased into it. eventually he ended up giving me a blowjob. Its was intense because of the feeling i had that its wrong, And he is good at it. But after it i got hit with a truck of religious guilt. feeling like I abandoned my basic morals and betrayed my core beliefs. Meanwhile my curiosity is telling me to explore more and go have sex with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im so confused, idk what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: any advice without bashing on my religion would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
