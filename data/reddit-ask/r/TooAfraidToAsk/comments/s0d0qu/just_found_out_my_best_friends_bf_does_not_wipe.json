While hanging out with one of his friends he told that Ned does not wipe after going #2. I thought he was joking but he told me it’s because Ned thinks it’s “gay” to do so… Ned legitimately thinks that wiping his butt is gay. Considering half of our friend group is gay it was news to me. What does this mean about Ned, and should I tell my friend?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
