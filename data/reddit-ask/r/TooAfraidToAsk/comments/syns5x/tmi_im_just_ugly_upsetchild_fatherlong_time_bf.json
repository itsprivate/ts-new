Last night went as follows: I shower, we tuck in our daughter, then we wait til she&amp;#39;s asleep, then we go at it. It&amp;#39;s been a few days and I got mine multiple times and when I realized how much time had passed ,I kept quiet but starting hurting so I grabbed the lube. He makes an annoyed sound but keeps on trucking. We switch it up to 3 more positions and I finally just started crying by how painful it had gotten and he flipped. I mean, bad. Turns out he took a boner pill. It was all my fault. I&amp;#39;ve never had a problem before...he threw it all in my face. Cried myself to sleep ...on the couch. He was supposed to give me a ride to work today and decided not to, to teach me a lesson. It&amp;#39;s 23 out,but there&amp;#39;s ice covering everything. 2 hr delay, and a 5.5 block walk. I just needed to vent. Oh he drug our daughter into it this morning saying &amp;quot;mommy&amp;#39;s only happy when she&amp;#39;s not at home&amp;quot;. I hate everything right now. She&amp;#39;s 9 and I would hurt anybody who made her feel less than anything if she were in my shoes . Sorry for the long post guys. ðŸ˜¬&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
