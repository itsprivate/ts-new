I&amp;#39;m 40 now, so this was quite a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told the sales clerk what size bra she wore. The clerk said, &amp;quot;No way that&amp;#39;s your size. I&amp;#39;ll fit you for your real size.&amp;quot; The customer protested, but the clerk insisted, and the customer eventually relented and let the clerk fit her for a different size. The new size was bigger than the customer was used to, but said it fit way better than all her current bras did. In addition, her back felt better, and she said her posture was straighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The clerk told the customer that most women wear a bra that is too small because once they get into this idea about what size their breasts are, they are reluctant to admit to themselves that their breasts have gotten bigger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, is this true? Are women wearing bras that are too small?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
