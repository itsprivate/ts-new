Also the idea of another human being living inside your tummy for 9 months just seems outright terrifying. And yet I&amp;#39;ve heard so many ppl say that its one of the most beautiful thing a woman can experience and how its worth all the struggle. I wanna know how women really feel about the idea of being pregnant. Do they love it ? Do they dread it but just don&amp;#39;t talk about it? Maybe it a social pressure thing and women actually hate being pregnant but just don&amp;#39;t admit to it because of the social stigma surrounding women who don&amp;#39;t have babies. idk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
