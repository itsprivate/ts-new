I thought we were going to get engaged soon. He is the only person I have ever romantically loved. He is the only person I have ever been with physically. I have been with him since I was 15. Will I ever be able to be with him after this? I feel like I will never be able to look at him the same. I’m 25 and I am scared to start over again. I love him with my whole heart and I thought he loved me too. How can you do something like this to someone you love? Has anyone had their relationship survive or even improve after cheating? He is everything to me, but I just don’t see how this can be fixed. We have never broken up before and I have never cheated. I love his family and I loved our life together. I just don’t understand how he could do this to us. He says he wants to fix it but I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
