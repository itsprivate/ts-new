However, due to some medical conditions, I can&amp;#39;t eat much food in one sitting. I started buying kids meals simply for the smaller portions, but now, I save the toys for my friends with kids. I always have a toy from some franchise that a kiddo loves to get, even if its just a silly plastic ball or something like that. The kids normally are thankful and like their small gift, some don&amp;#39;t seem to care either way, but I hope this whole thing isn&amp;#39;t weird or odd in any way?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
