(I was only 18 and She’s an entitled narcissist who thinks she can’t live without her son) I don’t want to live with this woman. I can’t think of anything unhappier than that, simply hearing her coming into the house talking on the phone bothers me. I want to live alone just him and I when we are financially ready. I currently live at home and he lives with his mom. I need to deliver this news to him because he is talking about marriage and after getting to know his mom for years I now know that I for sure cannot do this. He becomes rageful over really small fights and I fear his reaction to what I’m going to say. He has a very strange attachment to his mom and he is not going to take this well. How can I say this to him in the best way possible?\nEdit: I have posted about this issue before regarding what If I should put up with living with her but this is my first time posting about how I can say this to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
