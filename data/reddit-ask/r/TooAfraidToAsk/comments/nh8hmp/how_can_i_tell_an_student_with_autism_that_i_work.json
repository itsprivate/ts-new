  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I (18m) am a college student who took online classes from home this year and I work as a school custodian from 1-9 Monday through Friday. I volunteer to zoom every morning with a 5th grader who has autism and is fully remote this year because he lives with his grandparents and doesn’t want to chance coming in contact with COVID. I know the teacher of his class and she thought of me about halfway through the year and thought I would be perfect for him and helping him get his work done. Every morning from 9 till about 11:30 we are in a call together and do his work. Ever since he started with me his teacher has been amazed with his work and his mom has told me he is in a much better mood overall. The kid loves video games too, so his mom and the teacher told him that if me and him get all of his work done each morning then me and him can play a game together until I have to leave. This has worked great because he loves playing with me and stays very focused on his work in order to have the maximum amount of time on roblox with me. I really enjoy the kid and I like helping him with his work, but I hate playing roblox with him. I’ve been doing it every morning for like an hour at a time with him for months. He takes up a lot of my time though and I work full time too so I am not left with much free time at all. If we got off when he finished his work then I would be much happier. If we ever don’t have enough time to play or something gets in the way he starts crying and I try to do whatever I can to cheer him up. I know that this school year is over soon so maybe the best idea is to just suck it up and deal with it, but I’m wondering if anyone here could think of a way to help me out without making him too sad. Also, I’m not exactly sure if this question fits on this sub but I didn’t know where else to ask.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
