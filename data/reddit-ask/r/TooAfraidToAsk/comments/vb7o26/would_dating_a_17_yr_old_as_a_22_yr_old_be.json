I understand that 5 year age difference is normal when you are both older, but at these ages (17 to 22), a lot of people would consider it weird even if it’s legal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also my asking out line would be something like “hey I think you’re cute, would you wanna go out for dinner this weekend?”. Would this be a good line ? (Side question)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please remember what sub this is and before calling me names, remember I’m here asking this because I don’t wanna do the wrong thing. Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
