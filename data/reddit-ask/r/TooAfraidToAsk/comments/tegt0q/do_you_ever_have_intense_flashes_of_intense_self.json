My entire self image briefly collapsed and I legit started freaking out and had to calm myself down. That’s never happened before and it really freaked me out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happen to you guys too? What causes it?

I feel like getting in that kind of headspace again while scary could help me make decisions better and not be so indecisive and defensive about my ego. It just felt so strange to randomly lose my self perception and see what I project as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
