It has come to the point where I cannot drink any liquid after 7pm or I will 100% have an accident. I do not drink much during the day at all and feel that I cannot even fully hydrate myself in fear of peeing myself. When I do wet myself at night, I either wake up in the middle of a dream to myself currently in the act of wetting myself, or I absolutely do not feel it at all until I wake up the next morning soiled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some reason, my body never wakes me up before the act like everyone else. I cannot remember the last time I have woken up in the middle of the night to use to bathroom before it was too late. This is becoming a big problems as I quite often share beds on trips and I sleep with my boyfriend every single night and it’s too embarrassing to have to explain to anyone that I have incontinence at night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions? Is something seriously wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
