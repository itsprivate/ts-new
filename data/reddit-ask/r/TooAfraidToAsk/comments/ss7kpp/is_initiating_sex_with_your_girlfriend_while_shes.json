She specifically told me that that&amp;#39;s okay. Sometimes she was not in the mood (rarely) and would roll over, after which I stopped, but other than that she never acted like she didn&amp;#39;t enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, because she was asleep she couldn&amp;#39;t technically give me consent for every time I did this. So, was it technically rape?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
