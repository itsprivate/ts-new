Often this is referenced where women are left worrying about pregnancy after a hookup or breakup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it totally weird that guys who profess that fear wouldn&amp;#39;t use condoms. Is it just faux worry but &amp;quot;it feels better without&amp;quot;, or is it cultural Catholicism but feeling unable to just... Abstain? Or am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
