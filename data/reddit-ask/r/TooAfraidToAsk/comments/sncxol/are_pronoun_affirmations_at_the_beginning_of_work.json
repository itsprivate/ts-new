I affirm Linda&amp;#39;s pronouns are she/they, thank you Linda. I affirm Pat&amp;#39;s pronouns are they/them, thank you Pat.&amp;quot; And then the next person would go. When we organize meetings we include instructions about this to new people we are meeting with so they will know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The managers told us the purpose of this is to affirmatively express our acceptance of the pronouns of others. It feels awkward though, and sometimes I think the people we are meeting with seem anxious. Also when there&amp;#39;s more than about five people it takes a long time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So is this normal or is my company going overboard? I haven&amp;#39;t heard about this from anyone else, most people just put their pronouns in their email sigs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
