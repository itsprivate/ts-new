When we got married, we were asked when we were going to have kids. We always came up with a response around the fact that we are waiting and it’ll happen when/if it happens. The past couple of years, it has gotten worse and I started to answer with, “We don’t know if we want kids.” My husband and I have talked and thought about this for years and we don’t want kids. Now I am being pressured even more to have kids and the question comes up it least once a month if not more. I don’t even have the energy to say anything now. What can I say to my in-laws and other family members that will tell them that we don’t want kids but won’t cause a huge fight? BTW my husband is an only child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for any of the mistakes. On mobile and also just terrible at that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
