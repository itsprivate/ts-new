I’m a B-cup and I’ve looked into implants and fat transfers for awhile. That being said, this insecurity makes me hesitant to take off my shirt when my bf and I have sex. I really try to avoid it as much as possible honestly. I told my bf about my insecurity and he just tells me it doesn’t really matter to him and he likes my body as is. But I always feel like a participation trophy in society. It’s like if there were 100 clones of me, majority of guys would pick the me with bigger boobs. And I don’t like feeling like a second choice or feel like i’m just being accepted because there’s no better options at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality is, I’m an almost 20 year old college student so I (unfortunately) don’t really have the funds for breast enhancement procedures. So I’m going to have to accept it, at least for the next couple years. What are some tips or advice on how to feel beautiful as a small chested girl?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
