Apparently they were flirting and he was buying her expensive stuff; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did know about the expensive gifts and the long calls, but she&amp;#39;d normally brush it off saying he&amp;#39;s just a caring guy, he&amp;#39;s like that with everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways she claims to love me still, this was just a slip-up since it never went physical, and she didn&amp;#39;t realise herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come to terms that whatever the rationalisation, the real problem here was with my own relationship and broke up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She hasn&amp;#39;t accepted that she didn&amp;#39;t love me even after the break-up and I guess I never am able to believe that someone would do this intentionally to someone they love; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if my story seems incoherent, I&amp;#39;d be happy to fill in a few more details if needed, but i thought the situation wasn&amp;#39;t anything anybody has not heard about before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
