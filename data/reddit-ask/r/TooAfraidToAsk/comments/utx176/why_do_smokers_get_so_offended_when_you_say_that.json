I used to try to be nice if they sent a nice message and at least give them a reason why I wasn&amp;#39;t interested but I got so many nasty, hateful messages that I don&amp;#39;t even do that anymore. Smokers have to know that a lot of people don&amp;#39;t like that habit so why get so angry if someone nicely tells them that they don&amp;#39;t like it? Genuinely curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
