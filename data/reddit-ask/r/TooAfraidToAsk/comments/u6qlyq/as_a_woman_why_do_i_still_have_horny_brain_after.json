I masturbated in hopes that it would clear my thoughts and prevent me from impulsively saying anything to him, and I felt better for about 30 minutes after I orgasmed, but now I just feel turned on all over again and I don’t even want to message him back because I just want to ask inappropriate questions. He is not attracted to me so there’s no chance of him reciprocating anything which I wish would stop me from feeling this way. Why is this happening? I feel like a man.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
