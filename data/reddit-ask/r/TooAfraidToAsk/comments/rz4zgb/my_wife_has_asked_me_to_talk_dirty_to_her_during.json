She has asked me to talk dirty to her during sex and I&amp;#39;m not sure what to say. She&amp;#39;s about 40 years old and is an esthetician (specializing in Brazilian waxing). She&amp;#39;s a hard-core Cat lover and Harry Potter fan. We both have a fairly crude sense of humor. We don&amp;#39;t get offended by much. We&amp;#39;re a feminist family. We definitely lean to the left politically. I hope these details help with suggestions. I&amp;#39;ll use the best comment this evening during our sex. TIA!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
