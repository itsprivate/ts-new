Last night we were in the car and she gave me a very nice bj, and when I was about to finish off I tried to give her some signals that I was almost there, but she never stopped so I just kept going. After I came she swallowed it and kept sucking until it was all clean! I’m not gonna lie, that felt really good, like a 10/10 bj. But the thing is… I felt weird about it because after that, all I could think about is that she made that same thing to other guys in our town, and idk, it’s strange to me. And before you ask, yes, I’m not a really experienced sexual guy, and yes it was the first time someone did that to me.\n(Sorry for my bad England, speaking 3 languages have some downsides)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
