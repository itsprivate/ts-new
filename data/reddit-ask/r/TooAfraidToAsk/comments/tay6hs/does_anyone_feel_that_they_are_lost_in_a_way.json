  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know reading this, it’s sort of a vague question, allow me to explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not suicidal by any means, have been in the past and the feeling just goes. What I mean is there’s so much in this world that I can’t picture myself doing anything. Maybe it’s the fact that I’m young (M23). It’s probably just a head space thing. I was listening to my friend talk about his résumé e and he was going into detail about all the work he’s done. For the life of me I couldn’t see myself writing that extensive of a resume just for someone to read it and say “Yeah, you’re not what we’re looking for at the moment.” Or being on the other end and looking through someone’s résumé and saying no. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a confusing topic or thing to say. I just got the life of me can’t picture myself doing something for a living that I don’t like. I’d say I’m a genuine person 100%. What I don’t want is to not be doing something that I don’t feel is genuine. I like to make music and I like to stream. When I see others do it, music for example. They use a different voice than their normal talking voice, it felt like listening they use their “customer service voice” where it’s not their voice its a tone they only use for customers. Which is fair don’t get me wrong no one wants to hear an artist talk in their normal voice when they’re listening to music. It’s like watching a YouTuber and they go all energetic in their videos and then you hear them talk it’s not the same. It’s something about that sort of thing that makes me not want to do anything. I don’t want to put on an “act” to be able to survive or do something that makes me happy. Maybe that’s the depression talking or maybe that’s human nature I’m not too sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was never one for school and when I put effort in to something I like people like it. A big thing that sticks with me is that. I am the “actor” in my own movie. I get to decide what I want to do and who’s in my movie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it is something I want to do I don’t want to go through suffering or hardships. I’ve been through those and I’m good. I’m trying to tell everyone to relax let me be me. Average age of a human give or take is 80 years old, I’m 23 I have time. Not a lot of it but I have time. I don’t want to put on an act in order to succeed worst case that’s what I’ll do but I won’t be happy. It’s be genuine and not get anywhere or put on an act and possibly be more depressed than how I am already. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this is just something I struggle with on the day to day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I don’t want to put on an “act” to be able to survive or do something that makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forgive me for putting it in the wrong category, not entirely sure what this would classify as.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
