They have their own separate hotel rooms but he says she likes to hang out in his with him when they go on trips like this. This made me really uncomfortable because I don’t find it appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friends and family agree that they wouldn’t want their spouses/bfs having another woman in their hotel room alone either and that this was definitely not appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He says it’s normal and that me and everyone I know are just weird. While I’m trying to be understanding about the situation that to him this seems normal, this doesn’t sit well with me and I don’t feel comfortable with it. If I were in his place I would not let another man into my hotel room when he’s not there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how to feel on this one, I did express my discomfort with the idea but he dismissed my feelings about it saying that he’s known her longer than me and he wouldn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable just because I didn’t agree. This also didn’t sit well with me but I didn’t push the issue further. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand different people see things differently and we weren’t raised the same, but I still feel like your spouse’s feelings should be considered. Why can’t they interact outside of a hotel room instead of in it? That’s my thought on that. I’m not sure what to think or feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
