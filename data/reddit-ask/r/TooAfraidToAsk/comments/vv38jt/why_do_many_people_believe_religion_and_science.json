You shouldn’t take the bible as 100% fact. Making the earth in seven days can mean seven days in god’s perspective and seven billion years in our perspective. Likewise evolution is a fact   And jesus was alive.\nIm gong to get burned in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: this is my belief. I should have changed fact with 100% literal.\nPlease don’t force your beliefs that everyone else that believes something else is stupid\nThis was a question that i was too afraid to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Sorry if i posted this in the wrong sub\nThis question was originally supposed to be for christians i forgot to mention it.
