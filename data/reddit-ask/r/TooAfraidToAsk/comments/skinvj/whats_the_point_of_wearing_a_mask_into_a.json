Restaurants will say they require the masks upon entry but then parties will stay at their tables “dining” close to 1-1.5 hours without a mask on (I put dining in quotes because more than 99% of people I’ve seen don’t put the mask back on after finishing their meal as they continue to linger). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s like that there’s an invisible boundary surrounding each table where Covid can’t get to you or your party. But once you leave your table, you must have it on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m just not seeing the medical logic behind the mask requirements in restaurants. Can someone help me understand why restaurants still do this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
