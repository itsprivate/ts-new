I&amp;#39;m not versed in these products at all, I know there&amp;#39;s pads and tampons but they come in like different sizes/ratings or something like that. I just want to know the general best bet so I can hopefully help a girl out if the need ever arises. Also I&amp;#39;m sorry if I phrased anything wrong or weird, I&amp;#39;m new to this and trying to learn. Thank you for any tips/suggestions you can give. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tagged for gender because that&amp;#39;s what I felt it was closest to, if it should be something else I&amp;#39;m happy to change it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
