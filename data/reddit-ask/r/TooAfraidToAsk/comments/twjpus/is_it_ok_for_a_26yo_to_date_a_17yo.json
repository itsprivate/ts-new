Furthermore they&amp;#39;ve already had sex (initiated by the 26yo) and that would be breaking the law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t feel right about it. I don&amp;#39;t think a 26yo should be dating a 17yo because I don&amp;#39;t think an adult should be dating a minor. That MAN is old enough to get married, buy a house, a car, drink legally while my friend is nowhere near completing her education. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked a few people their opinion and so far everyone I&amp;#39;ve asked is completely on board with a 26yo dating a 17yo. I dunno man... am I being too judgemental?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks everyone. I&amp;#39;m going to try and speak to my friend before telling an adult. I hope everyone has a good day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
