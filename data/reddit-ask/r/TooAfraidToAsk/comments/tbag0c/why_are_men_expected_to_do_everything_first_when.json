  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girl here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most girls I know, including my friends, expect men to ask them out first, text them first all the time. Like, I don&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with reaching out to someone you like. You&amp;#39;d reach out to your male friend, but not to your crush? I don&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also found out, when talking to my boyfriend, that most of the time they don&amp;#39;t reach out, not because they don&amp;#39;t like the particular girl, but because she didn&amp;#39;t gave them any clues that show if she likes them or not. So if you think about it, you might be ruining your chance for potential relationship with someone that you really like and you wouldn&amp;#39;t even know. Men are, imo, equally stressed out when it comes to dating and clues we&amp;#39;re giving off as we are with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that the most girls wanna play &amp;quot;hard to get&amp;quot; card and they don&amp;#39;t wanna come off looking  &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; but still. One text isn&amp;#39;t going to change your personality, but it can change your relationship status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t believe that there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with asking a man out, for dinner or smth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think girls texting first, and them initiating relationships is okay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: when I first met my boyfriend, he asked me to write a message to him about the name of the song that was playing at the moment, so he can remember it later. I sent the message while sitting right next to him, and when I came home he answered. Now he says that he tricked me into texting him first, lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
