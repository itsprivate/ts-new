They&amp;#39;ve even got their own bigoted woke language. Things like snowbunny, white tears, white fragility. I mean it&amp;#39;s fucking terrible and I&amp;#39;m not white and it made me uncomfortable. I&amp;#39;ve started calling it out and pointing out the obvious double standards. No race should ever be demonized like this. It&amp;#39;s just going to bite them in the ass and I hope they realize that they&amp;#39;re just asking for major trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Ofcourse I get downvoted. Reddit can&amp;#39;t handle the truth&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
