The fear isn&amp;#39;t at a point where I won&amp;#39;t go out anywhere, but any time I&amp;#39;m around people,  I think about it. 😔&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit- probably could have summed up my feelings by saying this- I&amp;#39;m not living in fear and never leaving my house. BUT when I go out now, I think about somone open firing on us, 5,6,7 years ago I did not. Just another thing in this world trying to kill us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
