I have read quran verse by verse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an Islamic country, if you drink water in street in Ramadan, you can get arrested and they can imprison you, and beat you just because you were thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;in Quran, a man is allowed to beat his wife just because she has refused to have sex with him. (And its said that women are your land, enter them freely any time you wanted.) ➡️An-Nisā - 34 / Al-Baqarah - 223&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Quran, you are allowed to have slaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Quran, a women worths half  a man, and a woman&amp;#39;s testimony is equal to half of a man&amp;#39;s testimony, so you should bring 2 woman in a court of law so they belive you. ➡️ Al-Baqarah - 282&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are tons of other examples about how Islam violates human rights, and you can check them up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just exhausted about the fact that West tries to show that Islam is the religion of peace, because its not.\nAlthough I&amp;#39;m not saying Muslim should be treated different than others, all I&amp;#39;m trying to say is that Islam is a dangerous religion, and you can simply be dead in an Islamic country just because you drank water in street in Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so exhausted and angry that media tries to show a different picture of what Islam truly is. Atheists and other communities who are not Muslim have a hard time in Islamic countries, just because they think differently than Muslims. Please don&amp;#39;t be fooled of this picture, it&amp;#39;s a lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Homosexuals and every single community in LGBTQ+ flag, have literally no right in Islam, and worse, if they find out that your Homosexual or transgender, etc... they will either hang you, cut your hands or other tortures that lead to your death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;➡️ just look at this verse from An-Nisā in quran:\nMen are in charge of women. by what Allāh has given one over the other and what they spend from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband&amp;#39;s] absence what Allāh would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allāh is ever Exalted and Grand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m sorry for my grammatical errors, I&amp;#39;m learning English and I&amp;#39;m not so good at writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
