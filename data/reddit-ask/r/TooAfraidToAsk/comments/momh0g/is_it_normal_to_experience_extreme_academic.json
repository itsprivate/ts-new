Basically, despite the end being close enough to taste, it&#39;s like I am in a plane that is about to dive bomb into the Pacific ocean two miles away from my destination.</p>\n\n<p>I am tired, frustrated, and no longer as excited about being done as I am stressed and worried that I&#39;m going to screw up in my final classes. This definitely isn&#39;t the first time I have experienced academic burnout, and everything is definitely complicated by working full time and getting ready to move all at the same time. However, it is definitely my hardest go with it.</p>\n\n<p>One way or another, I am going to just buckle down and get it done...I just wish I was as spirited and focused as I was when I was a year our from finishing my degree. Is this sort of thing natural? If so, any advice? Thanks ahead of time!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
