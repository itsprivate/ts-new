We met each other in an online chat game for kids. And since then, we kept staying in contact, it definetly got less year after year, but still. In all this time we never met each other irl tough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s important to mention here we always had this sexual tension between us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three years ago I unknowingly moved very close to her, and we were so excited after figuring that out,, so we met of course. I tell you the sexual tension just grew stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We always used to flirt (that&amp;#39;s probably my fault since I love to flirt, even without further intentions) but in the last three years it turned pretty serious, there is no coding anymore, at least from her side. It&amp;#39;s official, i just need to do the last step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My problem is, the friendship to every girl I slept with is destroyed. Not right afterwards, but over time. I feel like it&amp;#39;s guaranteed that if I do this step, this story of our teenage online friendship which lived on until adulthood and carried over &lt;em&gt;irl&lt;/em&gt; will end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want it to end, but I also want to pick the flower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any opinions and experiences?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
