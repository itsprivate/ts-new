For example I’m walking through the park and a dog runs up me, I simply move out the way and avoid it. The owners then proceed to give me a dirty look because I don’t coo and fuss, stroke it or pay it any attention. When I mention that I’m not fond of dogs, people look at me like I’m crazy. I’m sorry but everyone has different likes and dislikes. I got bitten by a dog as a child, I find them dirty, greedy and too attention seeking like a hyperactive child. Don’t get me wrong, I’d help ANY animal out that’s in need but I wouldn’t own a dog and don’t like to touch them or interact with them. Why does this make me a bad person?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
