I don’t understand the difference. So, pan means that you’re attracted to all genders and bi- to both genders. We could argue how many genders there are and all but on a basic level people are attracted to secondary sexual characteristic and sex is binary. So a bisexual person could be attracted to a nonbinary person (because ,,nonbinary” doesn’t mean ,,sexless”). I don’t wanna invalidate anybody, I’m just confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
