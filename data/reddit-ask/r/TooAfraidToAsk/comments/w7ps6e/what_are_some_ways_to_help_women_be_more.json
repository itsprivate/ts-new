My (21M) girlfriend (21F) and I have been dating for a couple years now. She has this little issue where she starts to overthink and will not be able to relax before sex. I know that every female is different. I talked with her and she has no clue as to how to not overthink and become comfortable. I wouldn’t necessarily say she’s uncomfortable but she does overthink and it causes her to not fully be free. I tried everything. Giving massages, playing music, burning candles, etc. I take things very slow to help. Has anyone have this problem? How can I help my SO?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
