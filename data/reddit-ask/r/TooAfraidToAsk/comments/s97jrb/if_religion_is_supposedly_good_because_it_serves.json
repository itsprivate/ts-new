I do in fact have a religion (not specifying which bc why does it even matter). Can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m 100% religious, but there are some decisions and opinions that I have in life that are influenced by the religious teachings that I have received as a child, and there are a lot of things in the household like religious rituals and customs that we celebrate and practice until this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m asking this because I was reminded of a teacher of retiring age that I had in high school - she&amp;#39;s one of the biggest conservative people in school, but she wasn&amp;#39;t entirely a terrible person. However she just seemed to have this prejudice against atheists for not having a religion, or simply just not believing in religions. Once we were discussing a topic in class that allowed her to digress into religious teachings, and she openly criticised atheists because they were presumably &amp;#39;bad people who do not have a moral compass&amp;#39;. None of us spoke up because we were genuinely too tired to argue with her (again, she&amp;#39;s not a bad person, just a lady who has a triditional mindset), but sitting right next to me was an atheist who is genuinely one of the nicest people I&amp;#39;ve ever met. On the other hand, I also know someone who is one of the most religious people I&amp;#39;ve met and they&amp;#39;ve been an absolutely HORRIBLE person to me and some of my friends through her lack of consideration and recklessness when making important decisions. Granted we were all immature high school kids when I interacted with her, but it was absolutely baffling to me how everyone likes her just because she&amp;#39;s that one famous kid who&amp;#39;s good in everything and sticks very closely to her religion&amp;#39;s teachings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t know why people are making such a big deal out of people not having a religion: it&amp;#39;s none of their business, and if their lives are not ruined by the sight of an atheist then why is it even the least of their concern? Is it acceptable for people to be solely dependent on their religion to tell them what to do and what to not do? Is it okay for people to automatically assume religious teachings are good and there&amp;#39;s absolutely no wrong in it? I&amp;#39;m honestly very curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: rephrased some of the wordings I used to describe my teacher because I unknowingly generalised the people of her generation with a negative connotation. Apologies!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
