I actually encourage it! I love to see other adopting the culture! Why don’t black people, Jewish, ect like to see others using their culture or doing the same things? This is from what I’ve seen, people get mad at a white guy for having dreads. Why can’t he have them? Can someone help me understand? I love to share my culture and I feel like it might just be me but I feel like everyone just wants their culture to themselves and there no sharing going on. I get people calling me a cultural appropriator for liking the Jewish culture I don’t want to be a Jew I’m not pretending to be one but they treat me like the devil for wanting to learn about and be more in touch with the Jewish roots of my faith.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
