Does this not matter because it’s not related to the current trial? And would this mean that the law enforcement could arrest JD/AH for using illegal substances AFTER the trial? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have zero understanding of celebrity in US, but I do understand that celebrities uses illegal drug and they tend to get away easy. \nWhy is this the case? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just find it curious on how both parties seems to admit drug abuse and yet the media/authority doesn’t see it as a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: TIL that confession/evidence in the trial cannot be used to prosecute the person for another crime. Also drug consumption is generally considered ok, but drug possession is illegal. Thanks to everyone who answered!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
