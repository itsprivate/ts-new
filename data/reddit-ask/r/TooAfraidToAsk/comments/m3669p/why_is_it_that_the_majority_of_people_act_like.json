I get into an argument with another dude over a video game, they talk about how I am a joke because I was in the military, how funny it isn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get the chance to go to college for free, how poor I am and that since they make easily over 6 figures anything below that is sad. It&#39;s just really weird, I&#39;m sure these guys were just 2 random dudes on the internet who were probably normal decent people irl, probably decently liked without many real problems. Just when you get into an argument, suddenly they change.</p>\n\n<p>You can also see the same thing with people you know personally. They hate someone for doing or saying something they consider bad and will publicly bash them over it, yet they are best friends with someone who has said and done equally worse. </p>\n\n<p>Everybody does this stuff. Just funny how unaware everyone is about it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
