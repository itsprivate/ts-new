  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve only had a couple relationships, but a boy has never made me (23f) cum until now. I’d always used a vibrator in a relationship, even in long term ones, literally because “it takes way too long” or “women can’t cum” or “there’s not really a point” lol. Well, I fell in love with this guy and he is the first man to ever make me cum and it’s absolutely amazing. It took a while the first time because I had gotten myself so used to myself doing it. We’ve been together a year now and I have no idea why I ever accepted a man telling me “it’s just impossible to make women cum” LOL. I love the feeling he gives me and I love how connected I finally feel to a significant other and I am so incredibly happy in our relationship.\nOkay so here’s my problem that I put myself in: about a month ago he was out of town for a week and I was bored. I had thrown out my old vibrator a year ago and said fuck it and bought one to use while he was gone. I figured it was just an easy temporary fix since using my own hands gets boring for me lol. Except now I just have a vibrator and he doesn’t know about it and I feel extremely bad about it if he finds out. But I also feel bad telling him because no matter how I’d explain it, he’d probably feel insecure about it. It’s not exactly the same, but I know if the roles were reversed and he got a flesh light that he’s using sometimes without me knowing or some shit, I’d feel absolutely awful.\nIn the last couple weeks I’ve kind of just been using the vibrator for a quick “get off before bed” type thing lol. It makes me fall asleep faster and just feels good in general. I don’t even necessarily think of it as a sexual thing even though it is. I really don’t even have interest or a need to use it during sex.\nWhen it comes to my boyfriend making me cum, it takes a bit longer and I kinda feel like in some ways it has to “be a whole thing” whereas with a vibrator I don’t even really have to turn myself on or feel sexy, I can just use it as a sort of tool lol.\nSo should I get rid of it? I don’t want having a vibrator to fuck up our relationship, or make him feel insecure. I also don’t want to use it during actual sex because it just doesn’t feel as intimate to me for some reason, but I also don’t want to “hide” anything from him. I know it’s not incredibly serious or cheating, it’s just kind of an awkward situation to explain to him lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
