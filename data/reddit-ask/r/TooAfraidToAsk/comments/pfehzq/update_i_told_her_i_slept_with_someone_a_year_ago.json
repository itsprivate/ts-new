Gonna ty it again this time.\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Background story in short: met a guy at a friend&#39;s party last year &gt; flirted and all &gt; had sex &gt; got a new friend recently and turns out that the guy I had sex with is her hubby of 3 years.\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t know and he never mentioned the fact that he was married. No, they&#39;re not having an open marriage. No, he wasn&#39;t wearing any rings.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\n<strong>=============================================</strong>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I want to thank you to all of you with your ideas and advices. I read all your comments. Different opinions and perspectives, I appreciate them all. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to tell her my story. I was hesitant at first, where to begin, how do I start telling this story. I picked her up at her office after I asked her to have a &quot;girl&#39;s night out&quot; at my place since I just bought this fancy wine and wanted to try together with her. After we both got comfortable on my couch, I started to ask her &quot;how&#39;s things with you and your hubby?&quot;. She said that her hubby is currently out of town on a business trip for 3 days. I was literally holding up my tears and said &quot;I know your husband and I want to share to you how we met&quot;. She was surprised and asked if I was his old coworker from his old job. Oh I wish it was that simple. I proceed to tell her everything in the softest way possible. She didn&#39;t speak a word the entire time and was just staring at me while crying silently. She accused me of pranking her (since I love to prank my friends) and asked me to stop praking her this way because it&#39;s too painful to joke about. I needed to explain to her again and again that this is not a joke at all. I realized that she was using my prank habit as an excuse for her denial state. I went to the kitchen to bring her a glass of water and continued asking her if she knew or ever heard about her hubby&#39;s friend named Don (fake name). The party was at Don&#39;s house and Don was fully aware that I was hooking up with her hubby. Don earlier agreed to have a video call with me if needed.</p>\n\n<p>She broke down and cry. And told me that she was suspicious of him before. She was buying something at this 7-11 and her hubby walked out to the car first while she was paying at the cashier. The cashier then told her that he saw that man (ponting at her hubby) with another woman before, came here to buy drinks at night. She said she didn&#39;t believe him that moment because he might mistake him with someone else. Now after I told her my story, she started to believe that her hubby is really cheating on her. I just watched her cry for some minutes until she decided by her own to call her hubby&#39;s manager. Guess what??? His manager said that there&#39;s no such thing as business trip for 3 days and her hubby took 3 days off for family purposes. My friend thanked him and cut the call and ran to my room and cried hysterically while shoving her face into my pillow. I followed her and just hugged her until she fell asleep tired of crying. She&#39;s still sleeping inside my room as I&#39;m typing this.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: she believes me and passed out after crying knowing the truth that her hubby is a fucked up liar. I don&#39;t know yet what she will do next. But for now, I&#39;m letting her rest at my place first.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
