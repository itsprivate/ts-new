I’ve had this happen only a handful of times. 90% of the time when I match with somebody, unless I send them a message first, they will just sit in my “matched” until I delete my account again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why don’t you send a message first you ask? I do. But most of the time, I never get a response. I’ve tried asking questions as an opener, saying hello, pickup lines, whatever, you name it. 9 times out of 10, no response. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why do women do this? I’m bi and have matched with other males and they always message first. Why do they also even bother swiping if they’re not going to respond/read your message? Whats the point? If you swiped on me, I assume that means you’re attracted to me and would like to get to know me. Evidently, this is almost never the case. I’m not going to be attracted to anyone who doesn’t show they’re attracted to me as well. You have to show you’re interested in me, or i’m not going to be interested in you. If you swiped on me, I assume you’re interested in me. But not interested enough to make a move? Make up your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
