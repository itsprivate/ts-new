  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;my parents found condoms in my cupboard while i was in school. im a female 16 going 17 and the legal age for consent in my country is 16. my boyfriend, who is the same age as me, sleeps over every weekend but now my parents wont allow him to ever step foot into the house anymore. they set strict rules for us at the start and us being the horny teenagers we are, did not abide properly and we apologised to them sincerely and took full accountability for it. however, my parents called me a disappointment and a betrayal to my entire family. my mom has been mentally torturing me with hurtful words\n that make me feel worthless. i get good grades in school, follow my curfews and i dont do anything else that i should not be doing at my age(etc. smoking/vaping). they even threatened to kick me out the house if i think that my boyfriend is “worth the sacrifice” of our family bond. i wrote a letter to them apologising and saying that i will no longer bring my boyfriend over. i also added in about how much i love them and how i only want to make them proud. over this stupid mistake they called me stupid and told me they are no longer proud of me. do i really deserve this treatment?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit : i also got scolded last night and they told me i lost my family just by doing this. they keep emphasizing that my bf does not have the means to provide and care for me for life. but im 17 , im just dating to be happy in the moment and i trust this boy. maybe my parents do know better, but this is how i feel now. my boyfriend is assuring and feels really guilty about this. he texted my mom an entire paragraph about how sorry he is and how much he loves my family and me. my parents say that if he really loved me he wouldnt do this. i think they’re taking this out of context. now i just feel really miserable , but i dont regret everything i have done with my bf knowing that we did it safely and that he can be trusted. also, i love my parents with all my heart and did not mean to hurt them like this, i want to make things right but they are making it very difficult for me. my mom says she does not recognize me anymore and my parents think im ungrateful for everything they have done for me when i really am… i want to give back to them when i grow up. i  am trapped in a cage now and feel like im on the losing end no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
