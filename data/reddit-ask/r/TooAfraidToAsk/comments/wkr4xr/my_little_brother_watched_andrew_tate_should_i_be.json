  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My (21F) younger brother (16M) is a pretty typical teenage boy. He’s moody but in the way I think most teenagers are, and he’s overly anxious about school. I first learned he was watching Andrew Tate because my brother was showing me a quote from Andrew Tate about working hard and told me it motivates him when it comes to school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea who Andrew Tate was and didn’t think much of it, but there’s been a lot of talk on the internet lately about Andrew Tate being a bad influence for young boys. I know my brother and his friends both watch Andrew Tate; there was another instance of my brother telling me about all the cars Tate owns, and he showed me a photo of Andrew Tate and asked if I thought he was attractive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I brought up Andrew Tate to my brother and said I heard that he says some bad stuff about women and my brother kind of protested that criticism of him is exaggerated. I told him I was just worried and didn’t want him to absorb a bad message. My brother then admitted that Tate has some out there views, but said that Tate just says that’s stuff to generate controversy and get more views.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother continued that he doesn’t take that stuff seriously and just watches the videos for entertainment and likes Tate’s motivation content about working hard, success, not giving up, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left it at that and I feel like it probably isn’t an issue, but is there anything I should look out for? I’m not familiar with Tate’s content and what messages he is promoting specifically. My brother is a good kid but he is a teenager so it’s not like he’s talking to me about everything, so I don’t even know if I’d know if he was absorbing harmful views or what he talks about to his friends / how he behaves with girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
