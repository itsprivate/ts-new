I’m not sure. All I know is looking back at this relationship as an adult, it’s feels painstakingly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: So I was a year away from graduating high school and he had just finished up university/college. For those of you asking for “maturity” levels (I’m not sure if that’s enough info) but 17 year old me thought he was mature at the time so it’s hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
