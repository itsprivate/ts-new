I speak the same way to guys and girls meaning I don’t really change the way I act or speak if I’m talking to a guy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been curious if my extroverted personality is the reason I’ve never been asked out in my life cause I give guys the bro vibe ? And if that’s the reason I don’t know how to change , I’ve been this “me”my whole life. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: \nSince so many people don’t really understand what I mean lmao. Directly asking: Is being extroverted and friendly with a guy in a “bro vibe” kind of way the reason why guys don’t feel attracted? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: \nContext: I live in Asia. Do you think culture plays a role in the difference of attitude of guys?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
