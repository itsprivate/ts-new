  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my long-term boyfriend proposed, and I’m incredibly excited about it. However, his parents bought him the ring, and I’m really uncomfortable with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew his parents had money, but they’re very low key people, so I just assumed they don’t spend. But I’m pretty close with them, as is my fiancé, and he’s the youngest, so I guess they decided to throw a lot of money at this one thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked out the setting, and on the website where I found it, the diamond is a half carat, and the band is gold-plated, not solid. His parents sent the pictures to their fancy jeweler, who made up a copy with a 3 carat diamond and a solid gold band. Even though I know nothing about jewelry, I can tell that this is an incredibly expensive ring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I just feel uncomfortable to wear it. For all I know this is a 20k+ piece of jewelry that I’m supposed to wear 24/7. I have no idea how to thank his parents for it, and I feel nervous going out with it because I might lose or break it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also feel like it’s way too flashy, especially because of how big the diamond is. I prefer simple and low key things, and I definitely don’t want fancy, so I don’t even know how to manage it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, my question that I’m too afraid is to ask is what do I do with this thing? I want to wear it but I also feel like a gold digger walking around with this huge ass thing when I couldn’t afford even 1/4 of the price. At no point did I think it would look like this, and now that I have it, I really don’t know if I can keep it. I can’t even not wear it, because I see his parents all the time and they’re going to want to see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
