  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday night, two friends of mine (L and K) pranked me but I think it went too far. I didn&amp;#39;t get mad at them or anything because they seemed like they really meant it as a joke but it&amp;#39;ll be hard for me to trust them again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, there&amp;#39;s this guy (I&amp;#39;ll call him B) who has a crush on me in college. I know it because one of his friends told me. I&amp;#39;m not interested in dating him and I&amp;#39;m also not supposed to know he has a crush on me so I pretend like I know nothing whenever I see him so as not to make things awkward between us (we&amp;#39;re neighbors). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yesterday, my friends turned him into a stalker. During an hour and a half, they made me think he had been stalking me since September. L set up a fake messenger group with K but with B&amp;#39;s name and profile picture. K pretended to be B in the conversation. L sent me screenshots of the messages and pictures B had supposedly sent her. \nIt was creepy. \nThe screenshots of the messages contained information about me, my family, what I liked and disliked, details of my life only them knew about... Information he could have never accessed. They made me believe he hacked my phone, &amp;quot;was always listening to and watching me&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;knew everything about me&amp;quot;. They basically turned him into a pervert and a monster. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was paralyzed with fear. I told them I would go to the police and report him the very next day. They got panicked and told me it was prank. They laughed at how naive I was. They never apologized.  I didn&amp;#39;t get mad or hurt but I was shocked and utterly disappointed in them. I laughed it off but I know my face said otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I was naive but now I feel very strange. I strongly believe in giving people the benefit of the doubt. Like if a friend/sb I care about tells me something that seems a little far-fetched, I&amp;#39;ll tell them what I think. But if they keep on insisting that it&amp;#39;s what really happened, I&amp;#39;ll believe them. Isn&amp;#39;t it what friends are supposed to do ? Trusting each other? \nBut now, if one of them tells me there is a fire in our apartment, I won&amp;#39;t believe them. I can&amp;#39;t believe them. They just turned a decent guy into a stalker and a monster as a joke. I don&amp;#39;t get the humor at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday night, before they told me it was a prank, I started to become paranoid. I deleted pictures I took with my family, I was afraid to even use Google because I felt like sb was watching my every move... This bad prank triggered memories of the bullying I had suffered as a kid. Is bringing back traumatic memories in sb funny? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I overreacting ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
