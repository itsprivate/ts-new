  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it just me or is this ludicrous? My partner of 7 years is demanding a specific ring that is around $7500, and I just think it’s bonkers. I’m doing alright financially, but still only make around 50-55k. I live in CA, in a particularly pricey area. We don’t live together yet, and I’ve been able to save up a decent amount of money since I’m still living at home. \nAlthough I can afford it, I just think that  that money can be spent elsewhere. I’d be willing to put that towards her tuition (she’s about ~85-90k in debt). I also offered to pay for our rent for the first 6-8 months (~12-15k), so we wouldn’t have to worry about money and she could focus on other things like securing her career/job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to be smart with money, and I know at some points in my life I’ve been cheap. So I need your help in determining if I’m just being cheap right now, or if I’m crazy for thinking 7.5k is too much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: is 7.5k too much for an engagement ring?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
