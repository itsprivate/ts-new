His little sister (14y/o) had come with him along with his mother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two drinks in and eventually I (24y/o M) noticed his little sister was being quite flirtatious with me and doing the cliche things teen ladies do when theyre hitting on you (laughing too much at every joke, constantly trying to touch you etc...[stereotyping im sorry]). Im engaged to the absolute love of my life and have been with her for almost a decade and besides that the fact that she is 14 I obviously blew her off and ignored her demeanor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her mother however definitely noticed what was going on and felt the need to remind me twice that she is underage to which both times i replied &amp;quot;I know I&amp;#39;m not interested in her&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barring in mind d few years back I remember carrying her in my arms to hush her to sleep at a late night braai (bbq) because she was a little kid....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight she not only grabbed my backside she also purposefully stroked my genitals. I downed my drink and left immediately. Could i be charged for this? What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: i at no point gave the child any reason to believe there was any possibility of anything happening, we talked about anime for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
