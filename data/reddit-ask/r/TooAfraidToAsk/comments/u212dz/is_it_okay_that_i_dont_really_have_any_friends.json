  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re getting married. I have 1 friend. She is a really good friend, but I am not that good. I can only take her in small doses. I invited two other high school friends, but I just invited them because we were good friends and I don&amp;#39;t have any other friends. We don&amp;#39;t even really talk anymore. I don&amp;#39;t even have bridesmaids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner on the other hand has all these great friends. I like them all and we usually all hang out together. He has he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;bro time&amp;quot; with them as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I can&amp;#39;t make friends and I don&amp;#39;t like making friends. I hate having to put in the effort of having a relationship with them and I don&amp;#39;t expect it back. I don&amp;#39;t want to rely on anyone and I don&amp;#39;t want them to rely on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy my own company. I think I&amp;#39;m a bit of a loner?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner is my best friend and I feel like that&amp;#39;s all I want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just scared that at the wedding everyone will notice that I don&amp;#39;t have friends and my mom makes this face when I say I&amp;#39;m only inviting three friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;m just insecure and want some encouragement from strangers that it&amp;#39;s okay to not have friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks you made me feel better about myself. I was prepared to delete the post in shame that no one replied lol. Thank you, strangers ❤️&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
