I guess it can be because of social constructs of beauty not being inclusive of their type of hair, which makes them feel insecure and leads to this. My wife thinks it&amp;#39;s because their hair  sometimes gets really damaged after so many attempts to straight it up...but for me it&amp;#39;s the same root cause (insecurity leading to an attempt to comply to beauty standards).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But again, I don&amp;#39;t know. So I ask you Reddit: what are the reasons for so many black women doing this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
