And (supposedly) citing one bad experience they had with a queer person where someone probably aggressively demanded their pronouns or such-and-such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will also note that I very often just see most of the comment section either tip-toeing around some very obvious answer (like telling people &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, you are homophobic, transphobic, etc or being deeply sympathetic to the person and basically validating their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically my point is that a while back it feels like &lt;a href=\"/r/unpopularopinions\"&gt;r/unpopularopinions&lt;/a&gt; just became a place to be openly bigoted without pushback, and this sub has sort of been feeling like it’s slowly slipping in this direction. I see posts like this all the time now, and as a queer person existing on this sub it’s exhausting. I just wanted to see some rediculous questions that people had when I came here and now it feels like it’s just slipping into different territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my actual question is, am I crazy? Have other people been noticing this?? I literally just saw a post on this Subreddit today where someone was like (paraphrasing) “I have concluded that I don’t like black Americans, does that make me racist?” And basically the entire comment section was trying to “logic” their way around OP being… racist? When it seems like a fairly cut and dry question to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know what y’all think! Open to any and all answers obviously.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
