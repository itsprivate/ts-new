But irl most of my friends don&amp;#39;t hate it (ok I admit I only have 7 friends lol). They either get turned on by it or just find it funny. I&amp;#39;m the same. But it seems we&amp;#39;re in the minority? If you&amp;#39;re a straight girl then why would you be like disgusted by a pic of an erect penis? I assume guys like getting unsolicited nudes so why not girls? Maybe it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m still 18 so still very horny minded or something, maybe it&amp;#39;s older women or very religious women who complain about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: chill with the &amp;quot;rip inbox&amp;quot; type comments lmao, it&amp;#39;s not that bad. Most of them are asking how many dick pics I got or asking if I intentionally posted this to get dick pics instead of actual dick pics. And if I did get a ton of dick pics...I ain&amp;#39;t got time for that lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
