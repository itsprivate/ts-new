  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the title kind of says it all. Things were heated last night and we ended up having sex. When we were in doggy I noticed a brown liquid on my dick and decided to just finish there once I noticed because it grossed me out if I’m being honest. I’m new to the dating scene (second girlfriend ever and longest one at 6 months and we’re both 21). Every time since she’s tried initiating again I can’t get over the fact of poop on me and am repulsed and can’t get hard as easily. Should I be completely honest and tell her in hopes that it doesn’t happen again (and possibly make her self conscious) or should I let it go and let some time pass until I’m not as affected about it anymore? I know this is a weird one but any advice helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: from what I know she’s actually a pretty clean person and her period was 10 days ago for the last day. She also didn’t notice as I’d wiped myself off with a towel afterwards like usual and disposed of the condom fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: so as I’m getting roasted in the comments I’m starting to realize it was probably blood not poop. I’ve only lost my virginity like a year ago so it’s a learning experience for me and I’ve never had this happen with the one other girl I’ve been with and was curious what it was, or if it was even poop. My original thought was sweat made her poo hole a little wet and it maybe dripped down but idk I guess it wasn’t. I’ll just not tell her about it and learn from it because of you guys so thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
