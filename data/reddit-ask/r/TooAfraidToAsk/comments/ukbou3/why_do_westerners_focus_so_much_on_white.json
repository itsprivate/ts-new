  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems they all focus on how bad white people are and how these “colonizers” are evil for taking land from native Americans. But virtually every culture has done that to each other and everybody else has just left it as history and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like even native Americans invaded each other for land. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Romans took over Jewish land. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mongolians took over most of Asia. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Japan invaded China and killed millions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ancient Egyptians took over much of the sub Saharan Africa. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;India used to contain other countries like Afghanistan, Nepal, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean the list goes on and on and on. And yes MANY of them are no longer an issue but that can be said about western countries in the future. Every “empire” or super power will fall. Maybe next “white colonizer” will be china “Asian colonizers”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like that’s just history and how times have always been. People fought over territories and resources. Many of them had BRUTAL histories and had slaves and killed thousands and thousands. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why are people so focused on “white colonizers”?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: for those of saying the system is still in place of people are still “feeing it”, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s history and we need to move on. You don’t think ALL of those ancient civilizations “felt it” or had those systems in place for centuries are being conquered? But now it’s just history. Nobody in China bitches about the mongols anymore. Hardly anyone even bitches about the Japanese invasion which happened less than 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
