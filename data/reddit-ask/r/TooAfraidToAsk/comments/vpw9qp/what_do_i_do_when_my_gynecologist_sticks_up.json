Plus, I’m not sexually active (am 19) so it might be hard to insert the device (&amp;amp; me not being relaxed lol). Those who have had it, were you having convos with your doctor? Saying oh’s and ah’s when they’re showing you the ultrasound? I’m VERY new at this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: The ultrasound is to check if I have PCOS (as per my doctor’s initial diagnosis) after having explained to him how I’ve been experiencing symptoms indicative of it. I’m also seeing a few comments re: virginity, and apparently, this method is what’s needed to assess my situation but I would definitely bring it up to the doctor/technician in charge should it cause any uncomfortableness on my part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, please don’t be a creep, sarcastic or otherwise. It’s already a nerve wracking situation for me as it is, you don’t need to [jokingly] sexualize a medical procedure. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
