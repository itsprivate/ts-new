My boyfriend would be the third man I have been with. I am very picky over who I have sex with cause if I don’t feel anything for you then you won’t get it. I do say as a woman whose previous ex husband had been with over 90 women and my now boyfriend who has been with less than 10 it makes me feel like the same value is shared between us. So it matters a little bit to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
