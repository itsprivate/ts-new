And about a month or two ago I got high and my bf was eating doritoes and after eating he got all horny and started sucking on my nipples. I for one am really grossed out by this, I don&amp;#39;t like doing anything sexual with my bf unless he&amp;#39;s clean, and his mouth is fresh and clean bc he&amp;#39;s just a dirty person in general and has bad breath. This also might be a reason for my low sex drive as well. Idk I find this so unattractive and disgusting. Like who wants their tits smelling like saliva and doritoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
