My dad was the most amazing father throughout most my life until I started becoming an adult and now he is no longer in my life and chooses to have nothing to do with me. After I turned 16 it’s like he was a different person for no reason whatsoever and now I’m left feeling Incompetent as an adult with a completely uninvolved father\nEdit: I am 23 and haven’t spoken to him since I was 19 \nEdit2: for some more details, around age 16 he started becoming angry all the time and every conversation would turn into him starting a fight with me that would always lead to him saying something along the lines “you’re just like your f*cking mother!” (My parents had a bad divorce). He just got angrier and angrier and eventually just detached from me completely. I have tried numerous times to reach out but he gets extremely defensive saying things like “oh I know I’m the worst father on the planet.” All my attempts to rekindle our relationships lead to the same type of arguments we had when I was 16.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
