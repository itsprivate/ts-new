I have noticed as well that his behavior is a little odd at times. I’ll list some of the things he does that are suspicious:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• He turns his phone off or turns the other way when someone enters the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• He used to leave his phone in the bedroom when he went for a shower, now he takes it in the bathroom with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• My mom found an app on his phone called “Photo volt” where you keep an album with private photos in, and it has a passcode that you need to enter to get in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• I frequently see him clear his search history. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• A few months ago, I caught him looking at a photo on his phone of a woman on a magazine cover. \n(I couldn’t see clearly as to what it was)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m really hoping he’s not doing anything, but it really will break my heart if he is. Please someone share their HONEST thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also to add that my mom caught him a few years ago on porn websites!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
