We were into spanking, biting, light choking. But when I saw him a few weeks ago, he was very aggressive and violent which I wasn’t expecting. He choked me and I tapped out but he didn’t stop until I kicked him off. I said not to do it again, and if I tap out to stop immediately - but then he choked me harder with both hands this time and ignored three tap-outs. Then he spit in my face. He was also putting his fingers in my butt which I’ve told him I don’t like multiple times. While he was inside me I tried getting up and said I have to use the bathroom / leave for work and he’d just hold on and keep going harder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days later he admitted via text that he was drunk, out of control, and his behavior was unacceptable. He apologized and said he doesn’t know what he was thinking or why he did it. I told him it bothered me that he never asked me if I liked or wanted that and his response was “no offense but I’ve never had a girl expect me to ask them if they like it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He’s blocked and I haven’t seen him since. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did this happen? What “kink” is this; I’ve heard of CNC but we’ve never discussed that or the spitting? IS this a normal dom/sub dynamic? Was this a drunken mistake or do you think he has a rape play fantasy that he used me to live out?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
