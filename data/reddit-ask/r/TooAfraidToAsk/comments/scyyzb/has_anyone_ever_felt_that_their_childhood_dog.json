  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up with a fantastic dog.  She was everything to me.  When I got diagnosed with a chronic disease when I was young, I showed no emotion to anyone, until I burst into tears only upon seeing her.  She immediately comforted me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went on to work with canines for many years of my life.  Wolves, coyotes, and foxes in particular.  I have met, lived with, cared for over 60 wolves (at sanctuaries). Even raised one from birth.  My baby girl. My best friend, at one point, was a coyote. He didn’t let anyone touch him.. and I was the first. They always made more sense to me than humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love and be loved- respect and be respected. They are so simple in that regard…and not ironically, like me. I find humans to  often be absolutely absurd in their logic.. but dogs just make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really am afraid to ask.  Because I know I’m a  bit divergent. But this is one aspect of my self I am curious to know more about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever felt like they understand canines better than humans, to this scale?\nI feel like I have three parents.  Only… I connected best with the dog.  To this day I feel more comfortable around canines than I do humans.  I’m distant from my family, but latch on immediately to any dog that gives me a ‘smile’ and a “howdy, do you play?”  Likewise, I’m very good at knowing when a dog doesn’t want attention, or understanding their needs and desires- like how important to them their favorite bone is.  Or how fucking with them can really stress them out. It hurts sometimes when I see people interacting with dogs- yanking on leashes and feeding them food the garbage bin behind Trader Joe’s would refuse. I’m the guy that will remember to bring your dog a treat, but forget the wine I said I’d bring for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Children are intuitive.  If you try and pretend everything is fine, your kid will see through it. Dogs don’t do that to others.  They are genuine.  So am I a lone wolf on this, or are there other people that feel this, too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Btw, I am not one of those “Wolves are my spirit guide” people.  I genuinely feel similar to canines.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit- I’m going to try and sleep again.  I hope I get some responses. Dreamwell, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
