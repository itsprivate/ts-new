  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I (15F) have been spending time with my mother&amp;#39;s boyfriend, (23?M), and I&amp;#39;m genuinely confused as to whether or not I am being/may be groomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is constantly telling me pretty, or that he wishes he could marry me. While my mother was asleep at his house, he drove to our house where I was, to pick me up and take me to his house to help him paint. He let me buy something at the gas station and then bought me fast food. The car ride is a little long, so we casually talked about my mother and other things. He randomly brought up that he wishes I were 18, 21, or even 16. He said that he would marry me right now if I was of age (and has several times already.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kept talking about how it just seems wrong, but that &amp;#39;Who is to say, really.&amp;#39; and that &amp;#39;back in the day, kids would get married and have children at, like 12&amp;#39;. He then randomly during a normal conversation from the ride said that if I were to &amp;#39;get on top of him&amp;#39;, he wouldn&amp;#39;t stop it. He genuinely does not seem like the person to physically do anything to me. He is nice, and his demeanor doesn&amp;#39;t seem bad, but more so he&amp;#39;s just being stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kept saying he wishes it could just be me and him living at his house, without my mother. He was very nervous to hug me goodbye, and when he did, he squeezed my waist with his arms a little bit. And he also, while laughing/joking, will say not to tell my mother how he and I speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I genuinely cannot tell, he has not actually touched me or anything, so is it alright? he&amp;#39;s held my knee, or accidentally brushed his hand on my behind, which I genuinely think was an accident, but that&amp;#39;s all he has ever actually done physically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(edit: forgot, he also said he&amp;#39;d be waiting for me on my 18th birthday. And said that although I&amp;#39;m 15...really 14 and almost 15, that I&amp;#39;m very mature for my age, and act 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is aware I like girls, but he said he once turned a lesbian straight. Basically trying to tell me I might not like girls... and asked if I&amp;#39;ve &amp;#39;even ever been with a girl.&amp;#39; even after saying it&amp;#39;s totally awesome that I like girls.? )&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
