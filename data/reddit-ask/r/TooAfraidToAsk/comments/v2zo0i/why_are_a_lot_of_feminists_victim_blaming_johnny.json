In fact this was one of the comments &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think we need to reframe the narrative: why does an almost 60 year old man who owns an &lt;em&gt;island&lt;/em&gt; feel the need to sue his 30ish year old ex wife who isn&amp;#39;t very talented and at best a B-list celeb for $50 million if only for some sick power game. If the pro-Depp&amp;#39;ers thought about it for two seconds, they would realize he had all the resources to remove her from the relationship before it got so bad. The power dynamic doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the roles were reversed this comment wouldn’t be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
