  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not an actual practicing necrophiliac nor will I ever try to be. I also don’t JO to actual dead people either as it scares me. There may be another term for this but I get off to people “dying” whether it be a scene in a movie or a porn where they pretend to kill someone. I don’t really like extreme gore but I do like strangling, choking, poisoning, low blood shootings or stabbings. I’ve been like this since I was 12 and it’s kind of disgusted me that I have such a weird fetish. I’m wondering what it was that triggered this, I read an article today that brought some thought to this. It described how violence towards women has been advertised over the years and it has been a problem with objectifying women. An example of this advertising can be the “beautifully executed” ads for hitman: blood money where women are shown scantily clad with a bullet hole in there head I don’t remember ever seeing these kinds of ads as a child but subliminal messaging can be a bitch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What drives me away from this theory though is that I seem to be more turned on by the concept of death. I was watching a show, “Utopia” on YouTube and there is a scene where an unattractive man is slowly killed, his throat is cut, he drags himself to a glass door and slides down with some blood and I was horny as fuck. Of course I’m not gay as men don’t really do it for me but a scene of one fully clothed man strangling another might just do it for me. While the ideal porn for me is naked women being desecrated post mortem any normal murder scene close and personal might do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not looking for people telling me to get help I just want to know, what the fuck is wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
