She made a statement that I found interesting… she stated that she never got any pleasure in her teenage years from fooling around with boys and it was done to keep the guy interested in her.  She went on to state that it was the same way for her group of friends.   As a guy, I didn’t have the same experience nor did my friends, so I feel like her and her friends have to be the exception…She said she didn’t start really enjoying sexual activity until we were in our mid 20s.  She also didn’t masturbate until her mid 20’s which I think was the plays a part in her situation specifically, but that’s just my assumption…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question for the women is,  if you think back to your earliest sexual experiences, even pre-intercourse…did you get any sexual pleasure or was it to keep the guy interested?  Also what age were you when you first started to feel something pleasurable?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
