I’m 19, my childhood was extremely dramatic and stressful, I grew up with abusive parents in a poor neighborhood, so needless to say I was never bored, there was always something to do, and someone to run from. I ran away long before I turned 18, and was on the street/living out of my car for a couple years, and my grandparents found out around 6 months ago and moved me in with them. I’ve managed to turn my life around and I’m in college now to study psychology, but the more work I do in school the more depressed I seem to get. I’m so bored by peace and quiet and not having to fight for my life constantly, it sometimes makes me question what I really want for my life, because i’m not sure living a mundane, everyday life is for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;please no hate but constructive feedback or anything you think might help me see things differently is always appreciated, i’m hear to learn and try to be more positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
