The world has changed, this isn’t the 1900’s anymore and just because a child doesn’t physically look like a particular member of a given race/ethnicity, doesn’t mean they can’t learn the language, culture, customs traditions ect; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was raised by a blend of different ethnicities. I learned the value of hard work from the Mexicans and Chinese and raised me, my bachata and dembow dancing skills were taught by Dominicans. My values are a blend of Chinese collectivism and Latino’s importance of family relationships and friendships over personal ambition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So explain to me, how does a child with 2 same race/ethnicity parents make them any better than having mixed blood? What harm do interracial marriages cause to a collective identity? Please avoid simple comments like “oh it’s just WAY-sis-umm” I’d like to have an intellectual discussion on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
