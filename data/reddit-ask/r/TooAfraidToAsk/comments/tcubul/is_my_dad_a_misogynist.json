One thing, however, has been on my mind and I can’t seem to get behind it. My father has said some pretty obscenely harsh things about women that I don’t agree with. He has at one point encouraged me to manipulate and use them as it’s the only way to “win” and “be superior”. He also describes them as being a “lesser creature”. I asked him bluntly if he was a misogynist and he said no and got offended thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
