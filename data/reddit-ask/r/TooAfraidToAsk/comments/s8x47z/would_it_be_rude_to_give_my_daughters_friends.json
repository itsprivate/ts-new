Whenever they leave, I have to crack the windows and spray air freshener. I light candles when they’re over. They come over almost every day so it’s a constant battle. It’s gotten to the point where the smell lingers in my daughter’s room for hours or overnight, even with Glade plug ins and airing it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never mention it to them or to my daughter. I’ve been to their house before and while it does have a faint smell, it’s nothing like the smell that radiates off of them. Their house is also very nice and clean. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about giving all of her friends (including her other 2 friends) little gift bags with cute lotions, bathbombs, chapsticks, and deodorant. I wouldn’t want to flat out hand them deodorant so it seems like a nice way to give them some good smelling products without offending. My husband and MIL say it’s a bad idea and even if the kids don’t realize, their parents could get offended.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
