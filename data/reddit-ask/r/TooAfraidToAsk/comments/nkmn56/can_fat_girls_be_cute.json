I think that if I met another girl with exactly the same body as me I would find her cute, but when it comes to myself it&#39;s different.</p>\n\n<p>I also know a lot of people who think that fat = ugly, and it&#39;s impossible for me not to feel guilty or feel like I&#39;m doing something wrong when I try to feel beautiful without losing weight first, as if I was fetishizing a social and health problem, and that normal people do not think that fat girls are cute.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly don&#39;t know how to feel about myself and my body, but i&#39;m definitely tired of aggressive diets that make me starve and feel sick.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
