He has always had massive meltdowns in public when I was a child and even literally right now at 23 yrs. During these meltdowns he has had police called on him for coming after my mom multiple times and left a scar on my face when I was 8. Everytime I have fun he has a meltdown and we have to leave. he has taken over my moms life and she works full time as well. She has been yelled and screamed at for years by him. There’s been so many times she’s been so sleep deprived bc she has to stay up till 2 am talking him down and wake up at 6am for work. I’ve always wanted children when I grow up, but am I wrong for believing I never want a child w special needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
