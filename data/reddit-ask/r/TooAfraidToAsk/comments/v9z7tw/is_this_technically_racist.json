If someone was born in Germany and raised in Germany, people would consider them German no matter what their skin color was or their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, this sounds somewhat similar (but in the opposite way kind of) to Americans who say “I’m 10% native american and 60% german and 30% irish” etc. That very idea that your ancestry and/or skin color determines your nationality instead of where you were born/raised in. Is that not what they’re saying, essentially, even on a basic and from a non-American point of view?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry if I sound incredibly ignorant but I don’t mean to sound patronizing or anything of the sort. I’m just a bit confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it essentially saying the same thing as “Black people can’t be American because of their skin color/ancestry?” that racist people used to say back in the day? Except, you know, replace Black people with White people, and replace American with African.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any Africans (or just anyone who knows about this way better than me) would like to shed any light on this I would really appreciate that! Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
