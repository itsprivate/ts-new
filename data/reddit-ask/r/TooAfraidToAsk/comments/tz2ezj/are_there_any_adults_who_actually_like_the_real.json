How can people actually enjoy this life? Where you just wake up, go to work, work for 8+hours, go back home, clean, make dinner, eat, have only 2-3h of free time, shower, go to sleep, just to do it all over again the next day. And for what? Just to make minimum wage? Just so you can pay for literally just existing? How can people with childeren even do or enjoy this? How do you even keep doing this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
