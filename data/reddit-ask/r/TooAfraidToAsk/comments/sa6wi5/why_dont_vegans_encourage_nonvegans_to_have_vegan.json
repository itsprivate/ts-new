My wife has been a vegetarian for a long time and just went vegan this year, so I’m exploring a lot of new recipes to accommodate. I’m not vegan nor vegetarian myself, but I like all food, including a lot of vegan food. There are several days of the week where I end up eating vegan just out of happenstance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems like it probably also has a good impact on the environment. Not as much as if I went completely vegan, but limiting my consumption of meat an animal products has to at least be a step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I rarely see vegan organizations that are willing to make any sort of compromise with their mission statement. It’s either all or nothing, and that seems to actually have a detrimental impact on their cause. If the entire world just stopped eating animal products on tuesdays and Thursdays, wouldn’t that have the same impact as 2/7ths of the world going vegan?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
