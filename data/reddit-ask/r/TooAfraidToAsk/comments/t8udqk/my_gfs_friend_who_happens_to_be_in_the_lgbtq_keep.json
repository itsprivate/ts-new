All I can think of is alternative situations where if she said that about any other group she would be a purse clutching Karen. Like if she said that about black men it would be crazy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to equate it to racism directly or sexism but I feel like even if it’s not exactly sexism you shouldn’t make comments like that about people sex or gender. Yet I feel conflicted because I know how people feel about the idea that other genders can be sexist to guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
