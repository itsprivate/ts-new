When I say run I mean run like overnight without saying a word to anybody. I’d obviously send out reassurance letters to my parents so they are not worried but that’s as far as I want it to go. I’m child/ spouse free. I have a full time retail job that I could get anywhere if I just up and quit just to leave. I’m tired of people not giving a damn about me only when they need something from me. I won’t lie, my mental health is lacking lately and I feel this urge that if I turn and run I’ll feel happier. Travel has been in my hindsight for awhile now and it feels like it’s time. No this is not a suicidal thing, I do not want to kill myself, harm myself if any way shape or form. I just feel caught in this constant cycle of shit and life’s just a ritual. Same shit different day and I need something more. This life is too short to waste it living this way. How would I go about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
