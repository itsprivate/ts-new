In fact you cannot tell them apart from an ordinary white folk - the way to tell if someone is Jewish is when they declare themselves as such. You can also become a Jewish person by joining the religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas if you&amp;#39;re black- you cannot do either. You also cannot simply become white or hide it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If holocaust was about racism why don&amp;#39;t we call every type of ethnic cleansing an act of racism? &amp;#39;Xenophobia&amp;#39; is the word I would use, but not racism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t understand why she got so much backlash for it and got suspended. I would be grateful if you could help me understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: thanks for all the good answers! Seems like the issue lies around the definition of &amp;quot;race&amp;quot;. Nazis had a much more extensive classification of what race is than what we currently have. So yes, it seems to have been a race issue as they thought of Jewish, Polish, Roma people as a &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; and not as &amp;quot;ethnicity&amp;quot; which is how we classify nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
