  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I often see highly upvoted comments/posts about men who were complimented once 10 years ago and remembering it vividly because they never receive compliments and they wish it was more normal. But often this is aimed at women and wanting women to compliment men the way they compliment each other. Then you&amp;#39;ll see women&amp;#39;s replies saying that men will take it as an advance/hitting on them and they don&amp;#39;t want to cause misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is, if women are unwilling to compliment men (for valid reasons) and men are generally attention starved, why don&amp;#39;t they compliment each other? From what I gather from these reddit comments, &amp;quot;hey that&amp;#39;s a really nice shirt man&amp;quot; might go a long way and be remembered years later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
