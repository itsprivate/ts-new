My main question is why is there such a stigma of “haha dude finished and girl didn’t”? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen many memes about it. I’ve been told countless stories from my girl friends about a guy they were with and how the guy finished fast without her finishing, and they made a lot of fun of them for it. Some were upset about it too, even at the guys who they said “tried to get them off after”. I’ve never heard of a guy talking about how proud they were for “finishing and the girl didn’t”. It’s normally something they’re embarrassed about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I’ve had (former) friends who were girls who bragged about having sex, finishing, and then just leaving without the guy finishing because “I got mine, I don’t owe him anything”. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is there that double standard of “guys have to finish off the girl” but not the other way around?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pre-Edit: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve had that problem once where I did the ol\nfast cream special. Luckily, the girl I was with at the time didn’t care and made jokes with me about how she was that good. It helped cause I felt less embarrassed. However, Seeing that top post however made me realize that my goal wasn’t ever to finish but to get her to. And that my George Lucas edit of shooting first had me quite embarrassed initially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it cause guys only have one luge of splooge and we’re done for a bit? Is it cause some woman can’t finish or last longer? (That one I’m uncertain of cause my best friend said she can’t finish even by herself but feels great when the dude does)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
