When I say a bit I&amp;#39;m being nice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand personality is what should matter, we aren&amp;#39;t perfect and as we age so will our looks anyway. But I can&amp;#39;t help but not be physically attracted it&amp;#39;s the truth. I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt her, I do think she&amp;#39;s very sweet and I want to get close to her as a friend if anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one other thing that actually sadly is unfortunate is that she&amp;#39;s very subby and I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to end up with someone dominant. It&amp;#39;s just one other big thing keeping me from being completely attracted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this may seem shallow but I can&amp;#39;t change how I feel. : (  please help&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
