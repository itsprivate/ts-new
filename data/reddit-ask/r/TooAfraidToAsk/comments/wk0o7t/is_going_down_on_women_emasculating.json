Years ago I met a guy who told me that he dated a woman from some non Western country and the first time they were intimate, he wanted to go down on her and she stopped him by saying that real men don&amp;#39;t do that. She was fine with giving him oral though. I was told that going down on women was normalized through porn and that back in the old days, very few men would do such thing. The man who told me this was a friend&amp;#39;s grandpa. I don&amp;#39;t know but I wonder if any women or men see it as something not masculine or simply as something that emasculates a man. I know that many are totally fine with it but I keep wondering if it was somehow normalized through porn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
