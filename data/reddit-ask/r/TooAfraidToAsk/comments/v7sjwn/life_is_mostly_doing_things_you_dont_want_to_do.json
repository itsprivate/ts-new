Idk. We&amp;#39;re born without our consent, if we&amp;#39;re lucky we leave without our consent. We&amp;#39;re complicit in an economic system that&amp;#39;s basically just a blood engine -- like, yeah, ice cream, right? That&amp;#39;s great, sure, but then you think about how other people are doing shit they hate to make it. Or what about the animals? Where they have to strap a cow to a milking machine and centrifuge the pus from the blood crusted nipples out to make the ice cream? Everything just seems horrific. Our economic system is grown from the environment it&amp;#39;s created on -- life feeding on life, even the ground we walk on is decay. It&amp;#39;s just corpses all the way to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to keep doing this and whenever I&amp;#39;m around other people and they seem even kind of fine I feel like I&amp;#39;m taking crazy pills. This shit sucks so fucking much. I hate being alive&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
