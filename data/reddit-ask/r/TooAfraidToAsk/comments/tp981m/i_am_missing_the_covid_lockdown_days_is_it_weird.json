Returned to college after such a long time and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I am overwhelmingly happy, finally seeing my significant other everyday, going out, doing outdoor activities, it is so much fun. But in all this a small part of me is missing those lockdown days, no college, no routine, complete freedom to do anything at anytime, not seeing loads of stranger faces everyday, empty roads, an overall aura of silence, doing things at our own pace and comfort, it was awesome. Sometimes I wish we can go back to those day, like it&amp;#39;s disheartening to imagine, that might never return (don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, Covid was hell, but i am talking about how I perceived this time) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s that, anyone else feeling this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
