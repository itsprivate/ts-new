Now I understand how this might be construed as me trying to undermine womens progress but I promise I DO NOT think all women should be like this. Everyone regardless of gender should be able to chase whatever ambitions they have. I just want a woman that WANTS to be like this. I just want her to take care of the house and children, to be at home everyday after work so we can hangout all day and raise our kids. Everytime I say this is what I want women get really infuriated and tell me I’m just a sexist pig that wants a handmaiden. This simply isn’t true. Am I still wrong for wanting this future?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: to all who commented or dmed with great advice, perspective and stories of their experiences wether they were good or bad thank you. I really mean it. As to all of you who have shamed others or trying to push an agenda on both sides should go to bed tonight with great shame. This is obviously a big hot button topic that intersects with religion, culture, sexuality and very personal events. I won’t comment on here anymore because I feel like I’m in a echo chamber but you can look at my other comments to see more details. I look forward to reading every single comment as I have been and will continue to, this has been eye opening and honestly a bit of fun listening to different stories and perspectives and for that I thank you. Dms are still open if you don’t feel comfortable commenting here but I won’t guarantee a reply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
