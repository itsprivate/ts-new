One girl I chatted with from the Philippines kept telling me about how she want white kids with the &amp;quot;white genes&amp;quot; Also just posting tiktoks none-stop on her story about asian girls wanting a tall white bf. It was actually kinda disturbing and a huge turn off because not only did she speak ill of all asian men but it was just gross to hear somebody talk to you in a way where they just want you for what sounds like &amp;quot;physical&amp;quot; reasons. Now I know how asian girls must feel around neckbeards, but how come there is sooo much colorism around asians?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
