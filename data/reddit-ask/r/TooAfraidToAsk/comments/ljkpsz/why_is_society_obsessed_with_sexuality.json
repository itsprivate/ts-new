The gender you&#39;re attracted to is just as important as your name or what language you speak, it makes 0 difference in any situation. Why are we obsessed with labels? Why is there a whole culture revolving around homosexuality? Why are gay people and lesbians stereotyped and why do so many homosexuals fall into this stereotype? Like &quot;I&#39;m gay, that means I need to act what is stereotypically gay.&quot; Why can&#39;t we just forget about our sexuality and move on? As someone who is bisexual who never pays any thought to my sexuality, I don&#39;t understand any of it. Unless someone asked me what my sexuality is, I&#39;d have 0 reason to discuss it because it&#39;s not important.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
