  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came out of a 4 year relationship last year and the reason we broke up is I found the relationship was getting platonic. We had a toxic relationship but we both couldn&amp;#39;t imagine ourselves being with anybody else. I think a lot of the toxicity came from constantly being in each others space, like literally in each others company 24/7 where we just got sick of the sight of each other and started irritating each other. Eventually I realised I&amp;#39;m not making her happy. I started realising we barely have anything in common. That we exhausted all conversation topics and whenever we talked to each other it felt scripted.   She&amp;#39;d never break up with me though. Not enough confidence in herself. Too scared of being on her own and afraid I&amp;#39;m all she has. But I knew I could never be the boyfriend she wants, so I broke up with her so that she could find happiness in somebody else who can make her happy and she did. But it hurts. It took over half a year to get over it. It&amp;#39;s different when you&amp;#39;re breaking up with somebody because you love them and it isn&amp;#39;t a rare thing. A lot if relationships don&amp;#39;t end in an argument or a fight or bad terms. It ends from an agreement that it&amp;#39;s for the best and nobody talks about how much that hurts and I just wanna know why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
