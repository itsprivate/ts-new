I don&amp;#39;t have to deal with stressful managers or a toxic workplace, cleaning a regular sized home is very easy and efficient with all the technology we have now a days. The only thing I can really think of that might be a pain to deal with is cooking which takes practice and patience lastly including taking care of the kids which is easier said than done but as the years go by the kids start becoming self sufficient and your involvement babysitting decrease thus giving you alot of free time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
