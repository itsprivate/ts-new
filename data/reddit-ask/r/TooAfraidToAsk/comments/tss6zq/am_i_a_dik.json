He drugged her several times. He raped her several times. He drugged her, then manually removed her IUD, then raped her. He threatened to release nude videos (that he had taken nonconsensually) of her online, then DID, in an attempt to take her business down. She has been living in fear ever since she left him. Is it okay for me to feel a little closure in this situation? She is feeling triggered. She is feeling all the feelings she felt when she was with him. I know the right thing to say is, “whatever you feel is right and is okay.” But god damn, I feel some sense of relief that he never followed through on his threats of taking her with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
