So im gonna ask here since its been on my mind so much.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 months ago i was messaging this guy on grindr and we agreed to do some things, but not once did we agree to anal sex. Anal was not even mentioned in the conversation AT ALL. So i get to the guys house and we trade oral, make out, and do some other things. Eventually he tells me to turn around which i agreed to because i assumed he was gonna rim me since i just got finished doing it to him, but that’s not what he did at all. He put his penis inside and started fucking me. It hurt really bad since he was like 8&amp;quot;. I was too scared to tell him to stop so i just sat there and took it. He kept going until he came and i was completely turned off at this point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a week or so my bum started to itch a lot and i assume he gave me an std. if he did give me one then its still untreated till this day because im too scared to come out. Everyone in my life including my doctor thinks im straight. Was I raped? Or is it my fault for not speaking up&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
