I&amp;#39;ve never even had a best friend that considered me their best friend back, it&amp;#39;s always been a friendship triangle multiple times throughout my life. As much as I understand that their girlfriends/boyfriends are their everything now (and then they come back to me for comfort for a little while after they break up few months later, before they find someone again and the cycle can repeat lol) , I also can&amp;#39;t help it but feel a little bit down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
