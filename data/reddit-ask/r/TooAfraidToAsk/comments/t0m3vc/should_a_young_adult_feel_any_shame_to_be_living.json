I have a job, I conform to the laws of society, I don’t cause any trouble or mischief, I get along with my coworkers well. But at the end of the day I’m met with the same empty life at home. No messages, no plans, no pings, rings, or notifs. I have my pets waiting for me, but that’s really it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven’t gotten around to making any new friends. I’ve made none since high school, not even in college I’ve found any, haven’t had anything close to a girlfriend, and despite many things going my way in life, I can’t manage to change this one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost like I’m incapable of any connection. I hate to think this way, I try not to. Some days you just can’t help it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t drink or take any drugs or substances. Certainly not hideous as I exercise often and watch my health. Music and video games distract me from everything, but I’m probably not doing enough to meet people or some shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I happy? Somewhat yes, somewhat no. I like how I am, other times I want to move or go off the grid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
