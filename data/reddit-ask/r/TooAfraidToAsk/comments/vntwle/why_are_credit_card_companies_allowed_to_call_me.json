I know I&amp;#39;m late and their constant calling is nothing but a drain on me.   You want more money that I don&amp;#39;t have?  I&amp;#39;ll add you to the list.  Maybe at some point I can stop constantly stressing about losing the housing for my two kids.  I&amp;#39;d be fine losing my housing if it was just me, I would actually prefer it.  I&amp;#39;ve done it before and as soon as they move out I will do again, I hate renting.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t do it.  I already struggling with life and then this.  I&amp;#39;m not doing it by choice, jesus.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do they think that (unnecessary)constant reminders are going to make me pay something I can&amp;#39;t?  I don&amp;#39;t know, I just can&amp;#39;t...  Life sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  I&amp;#39;ve tried blocking them, but they keep coming.  They have an endless list of numbers to ghost?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
