But is it feasible for every road in rural counties to have a bus stop? Do they really expect people to walk miles to get to one? What if I want to buy a bunch of groceries, am I supposed to carry them on a bus? What if I want to use my Truck to buy some lumber to build something? Its hard to take 4x8 sheets of plywood on a bus I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just seems like this movement is geared towards people in populated areas who live in highrises who only need to ride a bus a few blocks to get to stores and work. I just cant see how not having a car would work for people who live on dirt roads in cow country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
