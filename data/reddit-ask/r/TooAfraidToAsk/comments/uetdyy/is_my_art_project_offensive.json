I’m making these fake cakes (using spackle, foam, and cardboard) that spell out the word “starve”. It looks like a vintage cake and it’s pink and red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A person in my class said that it might be offensive to those with eating disorders and maybe I should change it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, my art project is satire. I’m not telling anybody to starve. It’s actually based off of Marie Antoinettes rumored-to-be-said-quote, “Let them eat cake”, during the French Revolution. So my project is essentially about starving the lower class. It looks very opulent, I have jewels and “rich” looking fabrics in the background to get that message across.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I have an eating disorder. It’s binge eating disorder so I’m a fat and struggle to lose weight without going on binging sprees. So I feel like even if my project was about eating disorders, my perspective with binge eating could give context to the project regardless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But idk as I don’t want to offend anyone in my class or build bad blood between them. They could also be my potential coworkers one day and don’t want to start off on the wrong foot so soon!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
