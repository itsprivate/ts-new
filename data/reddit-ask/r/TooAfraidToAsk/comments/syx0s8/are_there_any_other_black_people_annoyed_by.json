Nothing annoys me more than my white liberal friends educating ME on oppression against black people. IRRITATING AS HELL. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know what colorism, texturism. etc but having other people TRY TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME is SO IRRITATING. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to pride myself on being a liberal. Oddly enough I come from a devout Catholic liberal Democratic household. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&amp;#39;d even say after these things or I would lean more conservative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sick of the demonization of relatively fair conservatives. Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro are not transphobes, sexists. etc.  Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro seem pretty harmless to me. Jordan Peterson seems pretty sensitive. Have they used any slurs in their discussions?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
