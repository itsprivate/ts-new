We haven&amp;#39;t done anything besides kissing, but we&amp;#39;d like to try certain things in the (near) future. But before we begin, we&amp;#39;d like to be educated on the topic of gay sex and especially in terms of STDs, so we can explore as safe as possible. For example, these are a few of the questions we have:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- If both partners have never been together with someone, is it safe to assume both don&amp;#39;t have any STDs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Is taking PReP necessary if both partners test HIV-Negative? (Or even better; is taking PReP necessary if both partners have never had gay sex before?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- If both partners are tested negative or assumed negative, is it &amp;#39;safe&amp;#39; to have both oral and anal sex without a condom? Or is a condom always advised, even when you&amp;#39;re exclusively together with someone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Are there any other things we should know?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know I could &amp;#39;just Google this&amp;#39;, but I&amp;#39;d prefer to hear opinions of perhaps experienced people, and since my sexed in school was like 5-6 years ago, I don&amp;#39;t remember much lmao.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
