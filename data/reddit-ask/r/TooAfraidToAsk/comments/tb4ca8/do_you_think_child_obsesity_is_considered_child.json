It just feels messed up that they let their kids bloat up super big, and those kids don&amp;#39;t understand the future issues they&amp;#39;re going to have. It just seems like pretty bad parenting. But I&amp;#39;ve never really asked other people about it and if they feel the same. So what are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I’m sorry, I shouldn’t say abuse since most of the time it isn’t intentional. And I do know that diseases, disorders, and genes can play a HUGE part. As well as poverty and the inflation of prices. But we can’t ignore the fact there are parents that will let a kid eat chips all day and soda and not say a word. People say this is because of pure ignorance, which that’s absolutely true. But it’s also unintentionally neglectful. That’s how I see it though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
