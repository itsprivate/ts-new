She was pretty strict, BUT my cousins are all in middle school and so is my younger brother. My cousin just graduated 8th grade and I went to the ceremony. Every girl was wearing unbelievably short dresses. Now, before someone tries to be an ass and try to bully me for saying that, shut up. Lol. There’s crop tops, booty shorts, dresses so short they can’t sit normally, it’s disgusting. I don’t know what happened between my generation and theirs. If my mom caught me in a crop top, she would’ve beat me!! WHY ARE THESE PARENTS LETTING THEIR KIDS DRESS LIKE THIS!? Not saying it makes you a bad parent, but Jesus, isn’t it kind of a gamble?? What if some creep tries to actually hit on a kid? Kids aren’t very smart, they could get hurt. Last thing: I’m not saying if a kid gets hurt and they’re wearing something maybe inappropriate for their age that it’s deserved or expected. I’m saying, why risk having someone target you or your child?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
