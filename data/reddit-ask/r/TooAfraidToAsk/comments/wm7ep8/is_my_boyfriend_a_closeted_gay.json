Before we were like ‘official’ my gay friend came across his Hinge account (online dating app) and I messaged my boyfriend asking what was going on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He replied saying that he deleted Hinge and he thought that that would delete the account and when he redownloaded it he didn’t know why the ‘everyone’ preference was clicked. Next time we went out I asked him if he was bisexual and he said no. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave him the benefit of the doubt because in this day and age I don’t see why anyone would lie about their sexuality when they date people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has gone to Europe and I’ve been looking at all of his new followers and they are all openly gay guys. Each day I wake up, take a look at his new followers and they are always gay guys. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if I’m overthinking but he sent me a few photos from his trip so far and his legs are now shaven, silky smooth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven’t spoken to him about the gay followers and I’ll feel really emotionally violated if his intention was to use me like a cover. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think and what should I do? Do closeted gay stories still happen?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
