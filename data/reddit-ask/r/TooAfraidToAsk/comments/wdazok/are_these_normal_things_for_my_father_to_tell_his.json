My parents are divorced, you see. In the past, my father has said things to me in the past such as calling me sexy or hot, that every boy will look at me, and he has said he wished he had a girlfriend like me, as well as some other things I&amp;#39;ve forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But anyway, once I told him, he was angry about it, I kind of had to make him promise that he wouldn&amp;#39;t tell my mother. (She would absolutely freak out if she knew) ...But while being angry, my father said, &amp;#39;Yeah, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to stop myself either, you&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;fine&amp;#39;, but you&amp;#39;re what- 14?&amp;#39; then went back to being angry about him saying the things he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are these (and the other things) normal comments that I&amp;#39;m overthinking? I don&amp;#39;t know where a line would be between a daughter and her father. We are quite close, and I&amp;#39;ve always preferred him over my mother.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
