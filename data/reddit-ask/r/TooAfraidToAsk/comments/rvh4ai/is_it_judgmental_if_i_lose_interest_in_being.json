(She lives with them)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it wrong if I slowly stop being friends with her? I’ve known her as a toddler and she’s a great friend, but her life really disturbs me and every time we talk, she’s busy with her games. She acts as if her game is her job (no, she is not some paid streamer). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ironically, she always tells me she wants to be a paid game streamer (or whatever that’s called), but she never puts in any effort. I even tried helping her take some steps, and she never completes anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
