I needed to find some old pics of mine which he probably has in his gallery, so I asked whether he can look for them, and he told me to do it myself while he&amp;#39;s taking a shower, because he didn&amp;#39;t have much time. I was browsing through his Google drive, but couldn&amp;#39;t find them. He has everything sorted by folders, and I only opened the one with my name on it and also a couple of folders from our vacations and so on. Then I saw a folder named &amp;quot;Stuff&amp;quot; and I thought that maybe it could be there, with some unsorted pics or whatever is inside. I opened it and found one single unnamed folder inside, which led to another one, and another one, and another... At this point it just became suspicious, so I clicked till the end, just to find nude photos and videos of some girl (just to be clear, I definitely mean 18+, probably around 20), which didn&amp;#39;t seem like something you can find on some porn sites and which were most probably made for him specifically. The girl is pretty attractive, to the point it made me kinda insecure. According to the folder info, some pics were placed there 2 years before we met, some just a few months before, but it was always the same woman. The folder was last modified 2 months after we started dating (as in placed into another folders). Not sure what I was thinking, but at some point I just lost it and impulsively deleted the pictures (permanently). I didn&amp;#39;t tell him anything, although now I can&amp;#39;t shake off the feeling that he&amp;#39;s still in touch with her, whoever she is, as there were some big time gaps between recieving the pics. I can&amp;#39;t call him out and feel super guilty for doing this, but at the same time I feel angry that he kept the pics even after we started dating, moreover, he specifically created these folders to hide them from me. Am I the asshole for doing this or should I call him out?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
