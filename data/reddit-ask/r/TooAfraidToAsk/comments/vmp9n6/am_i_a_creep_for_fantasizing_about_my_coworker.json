Honestly she’s a 10. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like such a creep for this, but I want to fuck her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would never ever want her to feel uncomfortable. I wouldn’t tell her I’m attracted to her or hit on her or anything. She’s straight and in a committed relationship, so there’s no chance for us being a thing. Even if that weren’t true, I wouldn’t want to make her uncomfortable at work (or in general, of course). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I think about/fantasize about fucking her. It feels good of course, but it also feels wrong because I’m sure she’d be creeped out if she knew. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I a bad person for those thoughts? Is it bad to fantasize about someone you know?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: After reflection and reading the comments, I think I’m just dealing with a combination of internalized homophobia and purity culture. Thanks, y’all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
