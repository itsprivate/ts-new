Most people know he was accused but no one knows that I am the victim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I come from a strict religious background and even though my mum supports me, she keeps repeating to me about how I shouldn’t ever tell anyone especially my boyfriend that someone assaulted me. She was like this before I met him. She kind of makes me feel that there is something wrong with me but when I talk to her about it she’s understanding? She tells me that people will judge me if they knew and that ‘mud’ sticks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now 21 and I have been dating this empathetic beautiful man for a while. I really like him and see a future with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mum keeps telling me I should never tell him anything of the sexual assault, what I went through and it gives me a lot  of anxiety. For example, I have constant fears that he will leave me if he knew or if someone tells him anything just because of what my mum keeps saying to me. Is this true? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day I’d like to talk to him about it but I’m not sure if it’s so I just want him to accept me because my mum has made me feel like there is something wrong with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should I do? What are your experiences with your girlfriend telling you about sexual assault experiences?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
