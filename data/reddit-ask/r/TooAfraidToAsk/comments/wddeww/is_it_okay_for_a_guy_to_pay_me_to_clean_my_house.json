She checked with me first and we met the guy beforehand and he came with a reference from another dominatrix so it was fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it’s been happening for a few weeks now and it is just such a strange dynamic like this guy who’s a professional lawyer pays our rent just so he can clean our house. He’s a super sweet dude and we’re just like telling him to clean? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a party on Saturday and it got messy and one of our bathrooms was just so gross but my first response was just “eh the guy will take of it” and then it occurred to me that what a crazy thing that was and the even crazier thing was that he did it! He spent a whole day cleaning while we were just hungover and I was like ??? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So is like is this okay?
