(up until my mother moved when I was a freshman in high school.) This made me associate with them less but now when they see me they say I &amp;quot;act like I&amp;#39;m better than somebody&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;act bouijie&amp;quot; simply because of how I present myself, how I speak etc. This went on from about when I was 9 years old till now. (I&amp;#39;m 20) They made me feel so alienated at a young age because of this and I realize that this heavily influenced who I am today. The majority of the ones judging me were grownups and some cousins. The majority of them did grow up in areas with substandard schooling systems ranking very low. Why should I be judged because my mother wanted me to have a good education at a young age? I notice this happens to my younger brother as well which is why I&amp;#39;m typing this now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see this a lot in the black community but I don&amp;#39;t want it to be a race thing so if you are any other race and went through this can you comment as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I do have a couple of cousins who are more understanding of this now and I don&amp;#39;t hear it as much now because I know which ones to associate with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The only difference is the school system I was in up until 8th grade and the fact my dialect was a product of it. Other than that I grew up relatively the same as them, poor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
