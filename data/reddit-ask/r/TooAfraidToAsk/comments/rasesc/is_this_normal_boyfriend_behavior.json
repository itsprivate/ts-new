Its like he’s no longer there and his mind is elsewhere and this is every single time we talk for the last few years. He was only attentive like the first few weeks of us dating. I could literally be telling him about something funny that happened at work and he will not react at all, but when his weirdo mom talks about stupid nonsense that revolve around her narcissistic tendencies he laughs so hard and I just get so confused. Its like talking to a wall and idk why because conversations with everyone else in my life are great. What could be the reason for this and is this just a guy thing to not pay attention?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
