Yet again, women my age are criticized for being picky, stubborn and running out of time. I want to prove them wrong but sometimes those taunts get me. I recently broke up with my ex who said I couldn’t find anyone better than him at my age (he is attractive but has little ambition with a temper). I have a good career, loves to travel, enjoys philosophy and psychology, very spiritual.. and has huge stamina for sex— and yet I still feel anxious. I hope to read success stories from women, men and couples who have/had similar troubles but turned out just fine. (I know some of you might think “you don’t need a man”. But my point here is, I’ll be nice to share happiness with someone).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
