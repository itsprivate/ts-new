There are some girls that have approached him but he always ends up saying that they are not beautiful enough according to his standards. That has happened 3 times already and the girls that have approached him weren&amp;#39;t unattractive at all and they had great personalities too. I think that his mindset resembles that of an incel. He talks about how all the beautiful women never approach less hotter men and that he won&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;lower his standards&amp;quot; just to have sex. His &amp;quot;standards&amp;quot; are pretty high and he doesn&amp;#39;t actually try to talk with these kind of girls. He just waits for it to happen. How can I help him get out of this mindset?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
