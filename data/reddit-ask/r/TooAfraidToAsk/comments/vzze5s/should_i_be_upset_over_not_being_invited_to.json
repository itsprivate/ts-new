We live in a neighboring state to most of his high school/college friends (1-3 hours away). We bought a house together, and we have intentions of getting engaged within the year. I’ve met all of his friends and hung out with most of them more than twice. I’ve never had a negative experience with these friends, and many treat me as if they’ve known me for just as long. That being said, since we started dating, he’s received 3 wedding invites that I have not been included in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand there is a budget, and it’s hard to accommodate for everyone. Plus, I understand that it is not my day to have a feeling over. I understood leaving me out in the first year of our relationship because these are college buddies that I didn’t meet at the same time as him. But at this point, I’ve been friends with most of these people for over a year, we interact on social media, and keep in touch just as much as my partner keeps in touch with them. It feels personal, so I’m here to ask… is it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
