I&amp;#39;ve kept it for the sake of making him feel better, but I&amp;#39;m going through a serious bout of depression at the moment and have many times considered using it on myself. I know it is loaded, and in a gun case in my closet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not want to give myself the option to hurt myself with it. Every day it becomes a bit harder to resist and I would like to get rid of it so that the temptation isn&amp;#39;t there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gun is not registered to me in any way. I don&amp;#39;t want my dad or myself to get in trouble for turning it in. I lived in GA when he gave it to me. Moved to SC a few years later. Who do I hand it to, and how would I go about it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do apologize if this is triggering for any of you or if this isn&amp;#39;t the appropriate sub for this question. I&amp;#39;m also sorry if this seems attention seeking. Google wasn&amp;#39;t very clear regarding the state laws so I&amp;#39;m seeking clarification here. I will remove my post if it&amp;#39;s deemed inappropriate for this sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your help in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
