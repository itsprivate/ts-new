Disrespecting christianity (along with catholicism, baptism- all the jesus stuff) has been widely accepted but when disrespect is caught going to other religions there’s immediately a defense. On tiktok and twitter I see mostly 14-25 year olds just putting the whole religion on blast and saying the most disrespectful things that would never be said about any other religion in public, also dressing up as nuns, priests, god and such for halloween when its frowned upon to dress up as other religious figures and/or in others cultural attire. Also the whole trend of wearing rosaries just as fashion. I see a lot of people blatantly telling christians that their religion is fake and how the bible is fiction, but happen to be the same people who defend other religions? btw im not associated w any religion im just curious from an outside POV, also i have no biases i understand this is a touchy subject im fr just curious&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
