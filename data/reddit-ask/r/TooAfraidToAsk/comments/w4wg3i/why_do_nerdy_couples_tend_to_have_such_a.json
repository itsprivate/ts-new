My heart melts for them&amp;quot; from couples (of any gender) where BOTH partners would be characterized as &amp;quot;nerdy&amp;quot; on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By &amp;quot;nerdy&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m referring to a vibe -- nerds can have any profession and income. Some nerd couples I&amp;#39;ve met consist of animators, graphic designers, app designers, writers, and most commonly software or mechanical engineers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The less &amp;quot;sexy&amp;quot; they look (even if they&amp;#39;re still somewhat attractive), the stronger the stable energy is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that couples that are more highly educated and are more financially successful tend to stay together longer/have more relational stability. However, wealthy, hot celebrity power couples tend to give me the opposite vibe: they come off as instinctively unstable and conflict-prone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve noticed the same vibes from nerd-nerd couples, have your assumptions been right? If so, what do you think the recipe is?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
