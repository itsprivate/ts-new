  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been friends for about 25 years. She is around all the time, stops in to see him randomly and use to sleep over in the guest room up until a few weeks after we dated. They seem close and I can’t help but wonder if they have any sexual history together. I want to ask him but I’m nervous to make him made or upset by asking. Or coming off as insecure if I was to ask. She told me she had seen his package before when he was injured and I’m not sure how to feel about that. Should I ask him if they have ever slept together?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: I asked…he admitted they did about 6 years ago when they both went through their divorce. He told me she is like a crazy sister to him now and that it was a long time ago. I’m not sure how I feel about it now. I don’t hold it against him but then with as much as she comes over and hangs out with him one on one it makes me uneasy. I have been hurt a lot and guess I’m worried about being hurt even more. So now I feel like every time I hear she has been over the thoughts will run through my mind they did before why won’t they again? Probably my own issues I need to work though but I’m glad he was honest. When he asked me why I was asking I said statements that she had made earlier to me brought the question to my mind. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this fact so I can just learn to trust him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
