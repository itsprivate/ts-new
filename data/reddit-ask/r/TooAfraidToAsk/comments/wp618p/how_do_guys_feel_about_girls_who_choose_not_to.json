How do most 18 yr old males feel about this for example, as opposed to someone whos 30 or 40 etc? Also when referencing mental health/ sanity the major problem for most girls from experience, is a matter of the fact that social media is a highlight reel ans it can often make people feel like they are a mess in all aspects of life. And the hyper exposure to flawless women w perfect bodies is also prevalent. Of course, one womans beauty doesnt take away your own but being a barely legal female, the comparison game will always sit in your unconscious no matter how much self work you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
