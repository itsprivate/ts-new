I dropped out of school at 8th class and just went to play video games until I was 26. Now I’m 29 and I have no friends and no family that is there for me. Whenever I get the chance to chat with people I don’t know what to say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I observed that people gossip a lot about other people and complain about their jobs and stuff. I don’t want to match that negative attitude, but how the fuck then have people small talk?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s just getting harder if you’re growing older. People my age accomplished so much more and did so much more in their life already.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
