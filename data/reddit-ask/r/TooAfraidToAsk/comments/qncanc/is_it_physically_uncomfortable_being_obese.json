I am not trying to insult anyone but whenever I see someone obese to the point of being called &quot;big&quot; I wonder if they are uncomfortable. It honestly looks uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>I am far from a godly physic but I would not consider myself &quot;big&quot;. I have like a light beer belly/dad bod thing going on. I ask this question in part because I will give myself periods were I allow myself to gain some weight before I work it off/eat better. I can usually tell when its time when my body starts to feel uncomfortable or it feels like I am getting man boobs. And I say this to be literal in a way. Like I can feel the difference and my body will feel uncomfortable. My body will feel heavy and I could feel the rolls and they feel uncomfortable. So ill almost get back into shape just for those reasons. </p>\n\n<p>This to say when I see ppl who could honestly be considered bigger I wonder how they feel physically. I know ppl who are bigger and they often have issue like bending or doing other &quot;normal&quot; things. Even things like fitting in certain places. One thing I have really notice is sometimes I will see them do this arm thing where they almost have to hold their arms away from their body because they can&#39;t keep their arms down the side of their bodies. Or where walking just a few steps makes them lose their breath. Again I truly do not mean these as insults. I genuinely wonder if those ppl feel ok physically? Like can they feel the weight? </p>\n\n<p>P.S. This is semi side but is also why I am not big on this whole promoting big bodies thing. I am not saying ppl have to be like models or career athletes but I do feel like we should promote a level of healthiness. Like I feel like it should be more acceptable to tell ppl when they are gaining too much weight because I feel like it at some point it becomes a health and realistic lifestyle issue.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
