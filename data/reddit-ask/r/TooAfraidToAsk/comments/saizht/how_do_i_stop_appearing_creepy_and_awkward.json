I do better around my close friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, I come off as creepy. It’s almost like I’ve lost all natural ability to communicate socially during the pandemic. When I say “excuse me” or “hello” it always comes out squeaky and awkward. I’d consider myself a kind person, and I’m certainly not trying to be this way. How do I stop? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
