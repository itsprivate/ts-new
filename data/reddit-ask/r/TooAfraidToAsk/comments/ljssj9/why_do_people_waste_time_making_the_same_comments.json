Basically every time something is written about the author will use increasingly &quot;funny&quot; nicknames to describe it.  Like if a post about a cat was made, the author would call it a &quot;little fluffer&quot; and the next time they reference the cat it will be &quot;small bitey floof&quot; or some other embarassing thing, changing the nickname each time to something more try-hard than the last.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I think ninety percent of the users here are bots or something.</p>\n\n<p>Also it is so clear that Reddit nukes any thread critical of China that makes it to the front page.  Yesterday a small thread got locked for no reason other than it mentioned how China was running mass concentration camps (demonstrably TRUE btw)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
