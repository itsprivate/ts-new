So I understand a lot of Frustration. \nAnd often women do behave shitty. (As usual, neither side on anything is flawless).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT I also see how men behave.\nAnd boy, it is truly amazing how much most (feels like most) men are genuinely lacking any sort of social skills.\nI don&amp;#39;t even know how to say it, so I will just list the Things I personally Encounter the most. But These Things are not in order:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not giving a single shit about grammar in the slightest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No manners. No Hi, no nothing, just jumping straight to some question out of the blue. Usually also with Bad grammar. And of course: No question marks. Ever. And obviously.. those are of sexual nature usually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zero empathy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No sign of any emotions, ever. By emotions I mean your everyday emotions. Like joy because something was funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No clue how to engage in conversation. Bad Timing. No interest in the other Person, even If its just small talk for hook Up. Changing subjects out of the blue. Ignoring sentences for no obvious reason&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are like literal averagely programmed NPCs who just go trough the motions and fail to make the Player believe that they are actual characters. \nJust lifeless stones who don&amp;#39;t care about anything and just do whats in the script.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they talk to women like that I honestly am not even surprised that most men get zero Action. That Shit is just emberassing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
