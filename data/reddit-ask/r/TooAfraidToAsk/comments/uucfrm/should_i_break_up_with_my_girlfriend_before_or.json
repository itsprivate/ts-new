I&amp;#39;m thinking I (16F) may just be straight after all (or just not into her), but I am unsure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like breaking up before prom (which is tomorrow) is wrong in every way; however, I don&amp;#39;t think breaking up after will be much better. I know I need to be honest with her and I need time to sort through my feelings. Am I attracted to her romantically? Was I ever?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t want to lead her on, but I also don&amp;#39;t want to lose our friendship. In an ideal world, I would have broken up earlier and tried to go as friends, but I kept trying to see if I&amp;#39;d regain attraction or something. I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m so lost right now and frustrated with myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I already know the answer to my own question, but would it be wrong to break up with her tonight and explain my feelings (that I likely mistook platonic love for romantic love)? When should I break up and how should I go about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
