But it was MY love language. She never did anything or went out of her way for me. I never felt loved or wanted by her. Our separation was for the best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, for example I just recently donated blood. After you donate, these sweet little old ladies bring you soup to replenish energy. I had no idea they did that, and when they ushered me to come sit down and placed a bowl of soup in front of me... I just.. burst into tears. I couldn&amp;#39;t handle it.
