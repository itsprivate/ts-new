I understand you shouldn&amp;#39;t judge people, and you never know everybody&amp;#39;s story, but why is it wrong to judge somebody harming an unborn baby and possibly adding medical difficulties into their lives with their decisions. At the beginning of a pregnancy I can be sympathetic, as going cold turkey can be worse for the baby if you&amp;#39;re addicted. But if you look ready to pop and you&amp;#39;re still smoking, I don&amp;#39;t understand why you didn&amp;#39;t wean yourself off for the rest of the pregnancy and just start back up when baby was born. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a smoker when I found out I was pregnant, and as soon as I knew I quit smoking. So why can&amp;#39;t everybody else do it? I genuinely don&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
