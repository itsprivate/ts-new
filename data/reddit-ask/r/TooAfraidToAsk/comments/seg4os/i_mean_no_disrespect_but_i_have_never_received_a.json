Why though?

Why? Why did they believe the Jews were responsible for their humiliation at the hands of the West?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: It appears to go beyond merely considering them &amp;quot;other.&amp;quot; They have &lt;em&gt;regularly&lt;/em&gt; and by multiple societies been targeted for elimination. They even have a word for it, &amp;quot;pogrom.&amp;quot; I simply cannot understand the level of hatred that leads society after society to systematically try and murder this group of people. It is, so far, beyond my comprehension and unique to this specific group of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
