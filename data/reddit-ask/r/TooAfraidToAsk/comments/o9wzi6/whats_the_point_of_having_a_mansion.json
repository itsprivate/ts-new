When you have a mansion you need to have a lot of upkeep. Yes you can hire people to clean and cook etc, but doesn&#39;t having strangers always in your house put you off?</p>\n\n<p>Also to me having a mansion just seems to put a massive target on your head for robbers. Like yeah, you can get your normal sized home robbed just as well, but I would feel much less safer within a mansion. It&#39;s basically screaming &quot;HEY! I HAVE A SHIT TON OF MONEY AND EXPENSIVE SHIT!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And then you have the fact there are SO MANY different styles of homes, you could LITERALLY build a kickass treehouse home, an adorable cabin on a massive acreage of land, an underwater base, but nah... I want the suburban mansion next to all the other mansion in this ugly ass walled off neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if I&#39;m rich the LAST thing I would do would be spending time in-doors. Excuse me but I can go on a plane in first class RIGHT NOW to ANYWHERE I want and do basically ANYTHING I wanted. Once I&#39;m done on my adventures I just want a nice cozy home to return to. Why do I need a 10billion sqf home to return to?</p>\n\n<p>Idk, I just don&#39;t see the appeal of having a mansion, I see no pros at all. Do rich people just feel like they SHOULD have these homes? is the space a factor? makes them feel grandiose?</p>\n\n<p>(Just for clarification I&#39;m not saying people SHOULDN&#39;T have mansions, I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t get the appeal)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
