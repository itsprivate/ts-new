  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (20something man) have a brother (20something man) who seems to be becoming more and more extreme. When I say “extreme” I don’t mean “political stance I disagree with” I mean that he says and believes legitimately concerning things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As kids, we were fairly close, hanging out and playing games together and such, but in high school we became more distant. We were in the same grade, but I was the more “popular” one of us and he tended to keep to himself. I don’t actually remember him having any friends, not because he was weird or annoying, but he just was a bit of a loner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I want to mention is that both of us were big into gaming during the “gamergate” thing, and I think that may have played a part in what happened. While I wasn’t really “sucked into” anything aside from those “feminist cringe comp” videos, I think he went much further. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In high school, he (as well as myself at the time) described himself as “politically moderate,” seemingly having the viewpoint of “socially liberal, fiscally conservative.” He was never hateful towards anyone, never racist/sexist/homophobic/etc, just had a certain view of how the economy should work and what role the government should play. Later, he became more “right-leaning” as he described, voting Republican in every election but still never being “extreme” about anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, he deleted all of his social media accounts. He was never super active, but I noticed he hadn’t been posting much one day and discovered his account was gone. I didn’t think much of it, as he never cared for social media anyway. But one day I found his twitter, and that’s when it seemed like he was a completely different person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything he liked, retweeted, and posted was some sort of racist remark, something about how women need to go back to “traditional roles,” and various things about how Jewish people are taking over the world. I was pretty surprised. Again, he doesn’t have any friends that I know of, and I’m sure he’s getting a lot of this information from other online extremists. In real life, he’s pretty meek and non-confrontational, so it’s surprising to see things like this from him, especially considering he wasn’t like this as a kid. I’m wondering what I can do to help him out of that mindset, and I’m worried he’ll just become worse as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
