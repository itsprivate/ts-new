  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Iâ€™m honestly just not sure at this point. I once lent some white basketball shorts to my dad when he wasnâ€™t doing so great financially, and was living with me at my apartment. When I finally got them back after literal weeks (heâ€™s the opposite of a punctual person) there wereâ€¦ umâ€¦ well ðŸ’© stains on the back area of them. Thoroughly grossed out, trying to be understanding, I proceeded to wash them 4 times, ended up under my bed folded up, stains still there, just to be washed again every now and then because Iâ€™m kinda afraid to wear them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought this is something that was an odd â€˜my dad thingâ€™, until I got my hands on my boyfriendâ€™s white, Naruto boxer briefs. Theyâ€™re absolutely adorable but I felt pretty awkward when putting them in the wash, only to notice there were skid marks in his underwear too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also remember seeing them in various places like visiting my brother and accidentally noticing his underwear thrown over the side of the hamper, as well as some bedrooms of guy friendsâ€™ of my boyfriendâ€™s, when Iâ€™d be invited to go hang with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This honestly, and completely undisrespectfully, troubles me. Idk about EVERYONE, but every woman I know wipes that bum over and over again until the paper is as bright as, well, paper, even if it takes 25 sheetsâ€¦ and my mom agrees. None of us have had that problem in our underwear since we were 6 at the very latest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my question is, are you guys just spending your entire lives wiping your bootyhole incorrectly and no one ever correcting you? Did your mothers not teach you how to do it right, or are yâ€™all just slowly forgetting over the years?â€¦because I honestly canâ€™t think of any logical reason that I know this many people with skid marks in nearly every pair of underwear, and theyâ€™re all men. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems silly, but itâ€™s a legitimate question I just canâ€™t get out of my head ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
