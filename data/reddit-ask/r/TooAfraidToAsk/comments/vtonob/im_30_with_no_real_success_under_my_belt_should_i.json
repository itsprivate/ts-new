  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m 30. I live with parents. That right there would conjure up in some peoples minds an image of a certain type of individual. Especially where I’m from in the US. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here You’re supposed to be out of the house at 18 or 19. My aunts, uncles, and cousins are all pretty successful - some of them own multiple large properties. I’m not sure what most of them think of me but one uncle in particular likes to bring it up during holiday gatherings a lot. I hear about him being out of the house at 18, getting married, and owning a large house at 20. I’m not able to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of characters in shows and movies that are these gross, unhygienic, leeches who refuse to do anything productive. They live with their parents and are just all around not good people. I see that and I think “God I hope that isn’t me”. And over the years I’ve done everything in my power to distance myself from being that kind of person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents never had to convince me to work. I went out and found it myself. I bought my own car. I pay for it’s repairs, gas, and insurance. I pay for my own phone. My own health insurance. Everything. My older brother is severely mentally handicapped and nonverbal. He needs help watching over. So if my parents need to be somewhere I’m always willing to stay behind. If my dad needs help with a project, I’m always there. They allow me breathing room to have time for myself but I always ensure that my free time doesn’t take priority over their needs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But recently something came up. My car had a lot of issues cluster together at once and it was going to be a massive payment and my parents offered to take up part of it since I was unable to. This killed me inside. The whole point was to save up so they wouldn’t have to do this. Of course I’ll be paying them back. But I hoped they’d never have to come to my rescue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s left me thinking about life. Am I a bad person? I’m someone who just doesn’t need a lot in life. We all get along very well so there’s that. But I still feel like a burden and feel like a failure. They like me being there to help my brother. So I guess they figure that’s more or less my rent. It would be a huge burden on them if I left. But I feel like a burden if I stay. I think my extended family is a bit ashamed of me. And I don’t know if I should be feeling the same or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
