I understand that everyone has lives but after asking for human connection from my friends every week for over 3 months I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that they just don&amp;#39;t care. I posted about how I was hurt by all of these things 2 weeks and all of a sudden people came out of nowhere with &amp;quot;Are you okay? We should hang&amp;quot; and now 2 weeks later they still leave me on read and don&amp;#39;t reach out at all. Am I crazy for thinking that they just don&amp;#39;t care?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
