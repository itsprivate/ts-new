I turn 24 in a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let me explain. I really love the idea of writing love letters and going on dates, writing love poems, etc. You get the point. The problem is I honestly do not like hookup culture - it’s not my cup of tea and I’d rather refrain from partaking in it. I’m not judging anyone who enjoys it - it’s just not for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like a bit immature with these thoughts as everyone else I speak to about these things generally say things along the lines of  “that’s not the world we live in today” or “stop day dreaming and get real”. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes me a bit sad. I enjoy hearing stories how other people met their significant others but for me …. I feel like I’ll never get to experience that. I know life is unpredictable but still….&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My apologies, I guess this was more or less me venting haha.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
