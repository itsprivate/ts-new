I have major anxiety (and also feel silly asking but this seems like the place to do it) and lately it looks like everything is either on a shortage or triple the price and everyone says it’ll only get worse. How bad can it realistically get and what can people do to make sure we can still get by? Budgeting only gets so far if gas ends up costing $15 a gallon and eggs cost $600 or something. Is there ever going to be an end to the price gouging?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d be happy with resources to read too, to get a more realistic picture that isn’t sensationalized and gives tips on how to prepare. I’m guilty of seeing headlines and panicking :(&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
