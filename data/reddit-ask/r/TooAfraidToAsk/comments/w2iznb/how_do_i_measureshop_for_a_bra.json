I’m distanced from my rest of my family so I don’t have relatives I can ask either. Asking friends just seems too odd for me. I was too nervous to ask store clerks growing up and now I’m nervous BECAUSE of how i’m still ignorant at my age. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sites/sellers have inconsistent sizing for cups and it seems confusing, so it’s hard to pin down what size I am. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slightly TMI: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should be a B34 in theory but it creates a noticeable bulge protruding from the “cup” of the bra. I’ve tried sizing up and down and different brands and I’m so confused. A34-36 sports bras are a cozy snug fit while B34 is constricting in non-underwire bras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any tips for understanding how to measure myself, any good affordable brands? I know this is supposed to be rudimentary knowledge, but I would really appreciate any help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
