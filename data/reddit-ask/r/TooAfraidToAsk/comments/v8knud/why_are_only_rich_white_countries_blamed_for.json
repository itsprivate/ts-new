Compared to the racism experienced in the US and Europe the racism in these countries is on a whole other level. People who are not ethnically Japanese or Korean respectively are treated terribly and it is incredibly difficult to integrate or climb in the work force if you belong to any other race and it is especially terrible if you are black or brown.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlmost no heads of companies in these countries are ethnically different and they sure as hell do not do anything to improve diversity or increase immigration. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rich White countries are constantly pressured to become more inclusive and make integration easier and accept  immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very interesting that democratic rich Asian countries are not held to the same standards as democratic rich white countries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m quite shocked by the double standards here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder why that this is the case?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
