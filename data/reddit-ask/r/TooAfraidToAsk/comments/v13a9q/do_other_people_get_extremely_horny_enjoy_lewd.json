I’m SUPER horny a lot of the time, to the point where it’s genuinely a problem sometimes with how much I devote to that side of life, but I don’t have any desire for actual sex. I just love the female form in addition to a few specific fetishes. I freak the fuck out over the slightest bit of midriff or ass or boobs showing or something, but when I actually see a vagina or see sex or whatever it’s somewhere between ‘this does nothing’ to ‘this is gross’. I know this is probably pretty common among kids but… im 20. Is there a name for this? Do other people usually have this kind of thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
