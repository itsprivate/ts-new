Everyone in the comments are saying how inappropriate it was for her to be wearing a bikini bathing suit to a kids water park but honestly what little kid is paying attention to that? when i was a little kid my only priority was having fun. I never thought of anyones bodies sexually at all. I just find it rude when people have those types of comments. I just don’t see the big deal. Just cause you have a perverted mind means 1-10 years olds have them? What’s the big deal? \nThis also goes for people commenting on teachers wearing “tight” clothing in schools. It’s like just because a women has curves means she’s automatically going to be seen as sexual. I grew up with thick women in my life.. i really don’t understand this logic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
