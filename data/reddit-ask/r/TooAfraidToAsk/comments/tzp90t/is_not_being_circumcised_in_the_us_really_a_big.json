My husband was adamant that we should and felt that because he has a penis he should get to decide. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a lot of debates, we eventually found compromise and decided that we will let our son decide when he is old enough to choose for himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now a few friends/family have shared their (unsolocited) opinions that our son will have a hard time in life with girls down the road because we didnt circumcise him as a newborn, and said we did him a disservice. Were we really wrong to wait and let him decide for himself? Is circumsision really such a big deal in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL/DR: We chose to wait on getting our son circumcised and let him decide when he is old enough to choose for himself. Friends keep saying our son will have a hard time living in the U.S. b/c we didn&amp;#39;t circumcise him as a newborn. Is not being circumcised really such a big deal in the U.S. ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
