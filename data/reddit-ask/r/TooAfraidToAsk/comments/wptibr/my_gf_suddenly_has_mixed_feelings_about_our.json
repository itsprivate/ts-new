We both love each other but recently she shared that she feels kind of empty when saying I love you. In her words, our photos together dont feel the same to her. I consolidated her and she seemed better. But she mentioned it again today. Should I be worried? I know feelings are complicated and shit happens but I don&amp;quot;t wanna lose her. I wanna help her but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I wanna force love upon her. We are gonna talk again tonight about it. But I&amp;#39;m really scared. What if it&amp;#39;s just something that happens, and she doesn&amp;#39;t feel love for me anymore? Or what if it&amp;#39;s unlnowingly due to a bland relationship? Vacation also took a toll on our time, we couldn&amp;#39;t find much to talk about in the last week of the vacation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 20 and she&amp;#39;s 19&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
