For YEARS we’ve been fed that a 9-5 office type job is the most soul crushing job on earth but after working food service for like 5 years and just getting a front desk job at a barber shop this shit is the life. I just check in and out customers, answer some phone calls, make appointments,sweep up hair and sanitize shit. My boss and coworkers are all cool too.I fucking love it. it’s really light work compared to the restaurant work I’ve done where it’s constant running around, tons of side work, cleaning for hours on end, having no weekends or nights. Not to mention getting to sit DOWN at a job. On top of that an hour lunch? Restaurant jobs you’re lucky if you get a chance to pee. Idk it just seems like people complain about it a lot when it’s really a cushy job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
