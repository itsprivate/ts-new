Everytime a woman is struggling mentally she gets a lot of support and advice but if a man is struggling you get “stop being a victim and man up”. Being able to work any job(outside of sex work or nude modeling) and not be judged for it based on what your income is. To be open about being bisexual and it’s okay. Hearing shit all over Reddit about men aren’t pleasant and men are creepy and it gets upvoted. Me being so a POC I’ve had women on here say I’m controlling just because of the race I am(middle eastern) and they don’t even know me. All of the negative racist stereotypes are always towards men and not women so much(except black women). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the multiple options women have in fashion. For men it’s bland. I’ll probably have multiple people call me an incel or whatever but I don’t hate women or anyone. I just wish that society wasn’t so toxic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
