What should i do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend has sent me and my friend group potential suicide notes recently, such as saying &amp;quot;it was nice to know you.&amp;quot; His parents argue a lot and i heard that his dad strangled his mom during an argument, and the day after that he was told that he&amp;#39;s going to get a new brother soon. His therapist declared him suicidal. Hes an athiest, and from what i can tell doesnt have much to live for. Hes constantly bullied both online and physically. He also moves a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am 13. He is 14. He sent suicidal messages and stuff of the sort to a 12 year old. We don&amp;#39;t know what to do and how to help him. I am scared to see what has become of my friends life, and hiw he&amp;#39;s barely hanging on by a strand. It makes a sharp pain in my head knowing that i have some of the biggest privelage i can have in life; a great family, a goal in life, a beautiful town, access to any knowledge i need, yet my friend has almlst the complete opposite of what i am gifted. I hope he will be okay. Please help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
