No one wants to swallow their pride and admit there’s a severe mental health epidemic among young men. “Well not all men so why should I care” or “you’re just being sexist bet you hate all men huh” is all I ever get from comments when I bring up this topic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any gender can be an insecure little POS yet somehow we extremely rarely see women picking up an AR-15 and mowing down a bunch of people in public or at school over it. Somehow they are collectively healthy enough to NOT go that route. Why can’t we discuss that? Why can’t we address this? Is it THAT much of an inconvenience for everyone to care about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
