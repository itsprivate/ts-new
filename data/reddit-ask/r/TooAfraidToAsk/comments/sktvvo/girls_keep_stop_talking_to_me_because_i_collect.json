I collect bottles at work, everyone gives them to me, and if I see them sitting on top of the trash I take them, to clarify I do not dig thru the garbage. Then whenever I walk outside which is twice a day I bring around a bag with me everytime and pick up bottles along the way. The last girl I as talking to said she didn&amp;#39;t want to be with some bum who has to go across the street to pick up 10 cents. People get the idea that I am cheap but I most certainly am not. My way of thinking is it is easy pocket cash and I barely have to work for it. I see a bottle there, I take it and it adds up, the only thing it takes is time and two minutes of gas. I usually make 10$ a week. Girls don&amp;#39;t like it but I don&amp;#39;t think I can give it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
