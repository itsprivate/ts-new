We are Canadians by the way, similar to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He lied and said the girl was 16 years old and in love with him... that he felt bad after she went to the cops about it. Mom bought it and thought he made a mistake. The cops assumed she knew the real story of the kid being 13 and assured her he would most likely never commit this offence again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting molested at 12 years old. She broke up with him and he went to jail. She hates what he did to me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I DID get mad. She got all mad, saying she just gave him the benefit of the doubt. I told her that she knew he slept with a teenager and stayed with him anyway, implying that&amp;#39;s why I was able to get molested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got pissed off at the idea of being blamed for what he did, She refuses to believe she was partially repsonsible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
