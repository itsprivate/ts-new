Mom bought it and thought he made a mistake. The cops assumed she knew the real story of the kid being 13 and assured her he would most likely never commit this offence again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting molested at 12 years old. She broke up with him and he went to jail. She hates what he did to me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I DID get mad. She got all mad, saying she just gave him the benefit of the doubt. I told her that she knew he slept with a teenager and stayed with him anyway, implying that&amp;#39;s why I was able to get molested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got pissed off at the idea of being blamed for what he did, She refuses to believe she was partially repsonsible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
