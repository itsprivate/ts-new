  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 23 year old male. I recently had an awkward conversation with some mates... They were going through girls our age on tinder and having a laugh, and chatting away. The topic of rating people came up. I rated people consistently a lot higher than they did in terms of physical appeal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question that I&amp;#39;d never want to ask is: I (male) think most people of the gender I&amp;#39;m attracted to (female) have an appealing appearance. Whereas, they were somewhat like 50% were appealing to a degree...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Statistically, the 50% sounds right. An average of mates found the average person appealing... so does that mean I&amp;#39;m below average? I found 90% (approx) appealing... I was called thirsty. told i needed to &amp;#39;J-O&amp;#39; more, and weird (like I see &amp;#39;imperfections&amp;#39; as features) etc... and whilst yes I am lonely, it shouldn&amp;#39;t skew it that much..? should it? It has made me question whether I need to just lose virginity to get that experience or whether my suspicions that I am in the lower 10-20% that you could rate in terms of looks. I&amp;#39;m not upset at them. I&amp;#39;m just upset with myself and confused. If you want specific example of what they found &amp;#39;weird&amp;#39; I found it more attractive for people to have &amp;#39;imperfections&amp;#39; such as &amp;#39;buck teeth&amp;#39;, acne, scars, or slightly overweight. Also please be blunt - I&amp;#39;m on a self-improvement journey with my psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Is it normal/ok to find 90% of the gender you&amp;#39;re attracted to appealing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
