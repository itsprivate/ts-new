Yet the DSM-5 removed gender dysphoria from being a mental illness but kept body dysmorphic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I understand gender dysphoria is still in the DSM-V but it is no longer a disorder like body dysmorphic disorder&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not being antagonistic or transphobic by any means, I just want to know the justification of the difference between the two and why one is considered a mental illness and the other is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
