Before I got off birth control about two years ago - I would say our sex life was relatively decent like maybe once a week or more sometimes. However, he claimed he didn’t want me to get pregnant before our wedding which was understandable, so we had sex like once a month if I was lucky and asked. but now we are married and very financially stable and I still have to ask and a lot of the time it’s brushed off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly it makes me feel so depressed and makes me hate myself. I feel gross asking someone to please have sex with me and show intimacy towards me. Overall our relationship is good like really good but our sex life is absolute shit - except for when we do have sex it’s actually really good and enjoyable. It is just a chore to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly I don’t know what to do. It is effecting me mentally and I feel like there is no passion in our relationship and it definitely makes me feel ugly like I’m to the the point of hating myself. I’m very open and have talked to him about it repeatedly and he just says sorry and he will try harder but he never does. And plus like how do you think that feels hearing someone has to try to be more intimate towards you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should I do? It is truly the only thing wrong&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
