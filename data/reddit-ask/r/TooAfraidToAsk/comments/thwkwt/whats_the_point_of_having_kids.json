They don’t listen, they cost a lot of money, they don’t make us sleep, I lost myself since I had kids, I wish I had some time for me, etc. So they suffer with kids from childhood to their teenage years. Then their kids just leave. What’s the point of having kids then? What do parents expect when they bring humans to the world? Parents suffer with kids and their “suffering” (that most of the time be abuse) reflects on the kids and possibly traumatize them for life. I personally wish my parents never had me because of how much they tell they suffered because of me. I don’t think I’ll have kids either because I don’t think I’m a good fit to be a parent. I realize I don’t have the patience for that. Why people have kids because they simply want them, without thinking if those kids actually would want them back or not? Why bother and have kids? Why do you do that to yourself? If they’ll change your life negatively why you insist on having them?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
