They said “yeah he’s been working out for 3 months now, but still there is not progress hahhah” and many other stuff. I would have not reacted if it was constructive criticism, but they were straight up laughing at me. (They were talking in another language which they assumed I didn’t understand).\nAnyway, it left me broken and I’ve been not able to have an ounce of motivation for my workout. I use to be excited for gym, but now it’s turned into something that I just want to skip. What should I do&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
