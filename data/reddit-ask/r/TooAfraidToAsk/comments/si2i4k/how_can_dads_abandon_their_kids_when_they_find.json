So the husband packs up and leaves. Now I understand, kind of, if the child is young. But how can you do that if the child is a little older? You’ve spent your life and all of their life with them. You are the only thing they know. It’s not their fault they didn’t know. Now they feel abandoned by the many they called dada as their first or second word. I understand. It’s a losing situation for everyone involved. But how can you abandon a child that loves you and you raised? I understand leaving your wife but the child too? That hurts them the most. I don’t understand how someone can just leave their kid. How can you just forget about the child?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
