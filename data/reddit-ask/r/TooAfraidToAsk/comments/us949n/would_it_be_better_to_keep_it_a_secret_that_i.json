We’ve always kept it strictly platonic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thing is, I had multiple wet dreams about him over the course of the last few months. They’re always super hot. Plus, I’ve found myself fantasizing about it at the most random times. I feel awful. He’s an amazing person and I feel so guilty about picturing him this way. I don’t think I have romantic feelings for him, I just can’t suppress the feeling of wanting him to fuck me just once. He’s charismatic, funny, and respectful of all the women around him. Easy on the eyes, too. Things like that just get me hot and bothered, I guess??? I’ve also caught him staring and acting a bit nervous when I wore revealing outfits. Its cute. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would be devastated if our friendship was soiled because I was being a stupid perv. The fantasizing has gotten more frequent lately. Like… on a nearly daily basis. Oh god, I just realized how bad that is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly have no idea how he would react if I told him this or asked him if he would be down to just try it once to get it over with. Is it better to just keep this a secret?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
