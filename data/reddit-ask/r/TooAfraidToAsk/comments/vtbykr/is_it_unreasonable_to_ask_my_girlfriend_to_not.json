  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in the past, in conversation with my girlfriends friends they’ve brought up how they know EVERYTHING (inferring they know about our sex life). This makes me a little uncomfortable but I haven’t said anything. I’ll sometimes joke about like my girlfriend and I have sex, for example after a long night out my girlfriend and her friend Emily walked my upstairs to my room. As my girlfriend was taking off my shoes I had joked “Emily you might want to leave things are about to get freaky.” Just to give an idea about the type of joking. It’s never usually specific or grotesque. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Tonight I was talking a little dirty to my girlfriend and she really liked what I was saying and told me I should write a book. I threw a little something together and presented it to her. She then said “Emily and I are going to read it.” For some background Emily is her friend who is sleeping over. I was immediately against this and said that I had wrote it for my girlfriend and I didn’t want Emily to laugh at it or something. My girlfriend insisted Emily wouldn’t so I just said fine. She then gave me all the feedback that Emily had, which made me very uncomfortable. I had explained that to my girlfriend and sort of just brushed it off. It makes me really uncomfortable that she was willing to just let her friend read a very explicit “erotic novel” about us without even asking if it was okay. My girlfriend has since gone to bed and it’s really stuck with me and just make me really uncomfortable and I’m not sure why I even said okay in the first place. I don’t want to seem controlling but 50% of sex is me, so I feel like I should have at least some say over who knows about it, especially when it’s things written from my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
