The Japanese call it Ikigai (having a purpose), for example. Even when discussing whether UBI (Universal Basic Income) should be a thing, people always mention that humans inherently like working. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not just because of the money, we like contributing to society and being busy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;ve never had a long time to actually do nothing, but I definitely don&amp;#39;t feel like I need to be working to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I didn&amp;#39;t need to work to survive, I think I could love my life anyway just by watching Netflix, going to the beach, the park or the cinema, eating out in restaurants, travelling, etc. - Just enjoying life in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was afraid to ask this question because, well, I don&amp;#39;t want to seem like a lazy ass and find out that everyone around me is actually super motivated or something haha. I don&amp;#39;t feel like that at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My life goal is actually to FIRE (Retire Early) so I can do nothing productive after that. No, it&amp;#39;s not to open a company while working &amp;quot;on my own terms&amp;quot; or something. My goal is to do nothing productive all day (except for going to the gym).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you relate to what I am saying or am I weird?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
