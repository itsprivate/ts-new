Heck, just take a walk through the mall. You&amp;#39;ll notice that most middle-aged men usually have a large pot belly, are dressed badly,  &lt;del&gt;balding&lt;/del&gt;, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on personal experiences and observations, women in general are mostly skinnier and noticeablely in more effort to keep their appearances up. Even as they get older&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems highly likely that since most middle-aged married men don&amp;#39;t put in the effort to look attractive, it&amp;#39;s probably the reason why they are not having an active sex life&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: balding is hereditary. You learn something new every day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
