I know every guy is different but there has to be a consensus right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think losing your virginity is anything special but I guess like other things in life, I’d like my first time to be lovely with someone I love and trust my life with. I also want to make sure the guy wants to be with me as a whole and not just use me for fun and disappear (that truly sounds scary to me because I don’t think I’ll recover from the embarrassment of falling for someone who was laughing at me in secret the whole time and pretending to share the same feelings) so a few weeks isn’t enough I feel. I think 2-3 months?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
