There’s a Panera in my area and a few nights a week (I’m talking two or three MAX), I’ll go in there and silently take an online order from the shelf if I see it has been sitting for a few hours (I check the time stamps on the receipt, so whoever ordered it is obviously not coming for it). The staff don’t seem to check the shelf and there’s always an old order or two still sitting there, and honestly it’s a good way to get myself fed, because I can’t really afford otherwise. I feel bad doing this, but I mean, the orders would’ve been thrown out anyways at the end of the night. Does this make me a bad person?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
