Tricking me into going to christian sleepovers etc, I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of it firsthand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean many of these people are grown, intelligent people. Can&amp;#39;t they look at the dozens of other religions that have all the parallels between them, and recognize that this is one of many similar belief systems, and recognize why people create those stories to deal with our mortality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just amazing to me how powerful that early indoctrination is. What do you think thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: ok I should add: I am not an atheist, I am agnostic. I went to Unitarian church for about 8 years as a child, which was sort of a very light attempt at indoctrination. But mostly just coffee and a lot of togetherness. Then I got old enough to study different religions and saw the parallels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
