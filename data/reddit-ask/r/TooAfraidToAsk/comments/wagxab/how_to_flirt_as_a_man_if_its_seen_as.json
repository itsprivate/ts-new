Is it because there are seemingly too many creeps nowadays?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Just because some people think bad of me here is an explanation regarding parties and bars. I hate being surrounded by drunken people. I got some issues with people being drunk. That&amp;#39;s why I hate locations that serve alcohol in general. And thanks for thinking I got an issue because women feel safe there. I don&amp;#39;t feel safe there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
