This stance is in regards to largely uninformed Redditors, of unverifiable credentials, offering “advice” with methodology that is not evidence-based nor generally is it without risk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Were medically-assisted suicide pan-legal across every single State, it would &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; not be allowed for users to give methods to others on how to kill themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your individual beliefs have nothing to do with this discussion, has nothing to do with adhering to rules in order to participate within a sub and further has no bearing on your ability to support &lt;em&gt;medically-assisted&lt;/em&gt; suicide, of which a Reddit comment &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt;, across various discussions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, If you tell a user a method to kill themselves, you will be banned and your comment will be escalated for additional review by Reddit admins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should know better than to provide someone potentially suicidal with methods to kill themselves, and if you can’t have that inherent moral compass then you should be able to gander at the multiple places our rules are plastered before engaging within this sub. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the rest of you with enough common sense that this message will seem ridiculous, keep on keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
