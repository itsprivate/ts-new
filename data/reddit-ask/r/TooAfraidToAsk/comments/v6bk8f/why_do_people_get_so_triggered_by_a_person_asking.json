  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see so many posts where someone talks about how their significant other asked them to lose weight  because they do not find their partner attractive with the extra weight on and all the comments are like &amp;quot;lose him/her&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dump that piece of shit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;go find a person who will love you no matter what&amp;quot; etc&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents have been married for 26 years, and they routinely tell each other to lose weight and make sure they hold each other accountable when one gets out of shape. At 60 they are both very healthy and fit and able to enjoy so much, and it is because of how they have cared for each other and held each other accountable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like a partner who says &amp;quot;no matter what you eat and no matter how much weight you gain, no problem, i will always support you and love you&amp;quot; is an enabler. Someone who cares will tell you the bitter and uncomfortable truth and will make sure you remain healthy. Plus, being in good shape is important for a good sex life and to remain attractive for your partner for as long as possible, on top of health.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really do not understand why so many people get so triggered by this and why it is considered terrible to ask your spouse to lose weight and stay in shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
