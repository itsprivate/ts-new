But i feel like when I go on doordash and they have specific catagory for black-owned restaurants, or on Netflix they have a category of black-directed movies, isn&amp;#39;t pointing out the race, racist? Like i totally understand this is in an effort to promote these establishments and movies, but I feel separating them into a catagory not based on the type of cuisine or cinema(drama, comedy, etc), but rather based on the race of the director or restaurant owner, therefore putting a magnifying glass on the color of the skin rather than what they are trying to sell, is a form of segregation based on race. Im not smart to know how to fix it, but it just seems like if we keep pointing out the race of  people, whether to promote or attack, we will never see true equality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
