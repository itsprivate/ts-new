Density means you can accomplish everything on foot/bike/public transit or <em>maybe</em> rideshare. When you add cars, it takes away from your ability to do that because you make infrastructure to support cars, not people. I also just find cars obnoxious. They&#39;re really loud and polluting and just take up so much space. Hard to enjoy outdoor dining when all you hear is cars honking and people yelling and tires screeching.</p>\n\n<p>I brought this up to some people I was talking to and I was surprised by the angry response it received. They hated the idea of cars not being in the city. They basically argued a car is the best invention ever and changes everything for the better. They said cities should add MORE roads and parking so we can have even more cars. I honestly had no idea people felt this way</p>\n\n<p>Am I in a small minority or filter bubble here? I feel like I might have been in a filter bubble because all my general social media group seems to fairly agree, but they&#39;re similar to me</p>\n\n<p>Edit: just to be more clear it&#39;s more about individuals having individual cars to transport themselves as their main means of transportation. That&#39;s still like 80% of people on the road</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
