I feel like there’s something wrong with me and I don’t know a lot of people that don’t do it. Me and my male friend told each other our body counts the other day and he was shocked that mine was 1 (was in a relationship). I’m really not trying to get attention here or come off weird. I’m just asking, there’s plenty of people that don’t like hookups right? I just don’t like it and it feels weird doing stuff with someone that I’m not in a relationship with. I can talk and all that stuff but when it comes to meeting in person I’m just like mmm no. I think it’s also a safety thing as well, idk these men that’s kind of uncomfortable and puts me in a unnecessary/dangerous situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hearing from people my age would be nice, but also adults as well. Was hookup culture always popular or is it more common now bc of social media and our newfound access to lots of people?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
