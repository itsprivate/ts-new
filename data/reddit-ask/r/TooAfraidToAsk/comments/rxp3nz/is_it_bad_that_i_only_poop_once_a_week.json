I will literally only poop like once a week, sometimes I&amp;#39;ll even go once every week and a half. When I finally do take a shit it&amp;#39;s not painful or hard and it&amp;#39;s not a lot of poop???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: OKAY APPARENTLY THIS IS BAD, lol. I kind of wanted to add in the detail that if I get anxious, I will poop but it&amp;#39;s really sudden and my stomach will hurt a LOT. I don&amp;#39;t know if that changes anything. This doesn&amp;#39;t happen too often, just if I&amp;#39;m worried about something and/or right before my period. But my &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; is in fact once a week. Thank you for everyone who has replied so far. I genuinely didn&amp;#39;t realize this was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
