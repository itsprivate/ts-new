But I don&amp;#39;t understand why it keeps happening. Like it&amp;#39;s happened with 7 different guys. It&amp;#39;s only the first time and after that they&amp;#39;re fine. I understand this is not a weird thing or my fault but it&amp;#39;s hard to do that when it keeps happening. I just want to know if it&amp;#39;s me or something I&amp;#39;m doing????&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
