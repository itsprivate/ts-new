She comes from a traditional Mexican family were they are all close and affectionate with each other. However, with her younger brother, she seems to be very touchy with him. The cuddle during movies, he hugs her with hands around her waist, and strangely, when her other family comes around, they seem to cut it off and act &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;... Now I feel like I&amp;#39;m overthinking the situation, especially since with my siblings, we are not as affectionate but still close. I think this could just be a cultural thing, but it feels very inappropriate, especially when they break away when their folks pass by. I&amp;#39;m definitely overthinking this right??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
