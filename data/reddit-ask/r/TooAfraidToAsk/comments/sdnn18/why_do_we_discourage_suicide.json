Isn&amp;#39;t it more selfish to hold someone in what they feel like is a prison even though they didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong. It&amp;#39;s not like  they signed up to be here or anything. When ppl die of course their loved ones will be sad but is temporary sadness not that bad of a price to say if you know that your loved ones won&amp;#39;t after suffer anymore? The reattemption rate is also 30% with people who don&amp;#39;t reattempt still having suicidal thoughts. I&amp;#39;m definetly not saying we should encourage it but at the same time who are we to force people to stay? Especially those who are then locked up in mental hospitals&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
