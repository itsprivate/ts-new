Open mouth crunching, lip smacking, huge mouthfuls of food, loud finger sucking, he gets sauces &amp;amp; bits all over his mouth… it drives me crazy and grosses me out. He does it in restaurants as well. I realize we were brought up differently and I was reminded of my table manners as a kid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s terrible, but I’m having trouble eating with him without getting distracted anymore :( He’s 33… and didn’t do this when we were first dating. He ate super cleanly. Now we’re 2 years in and he’s begun to do this. So far, I gently have influenced him to use a napkin instead of using his hand or arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to eat with him and not be upset by this. I’m embarrassed to even be this put off by it. And he’s a wonderful partner. Is it rude to tell him somehow in a non-hurtful way? Should I just get over it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited- to add I’d say it’s misophonia but no other daily noise bothers me! Only this&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
