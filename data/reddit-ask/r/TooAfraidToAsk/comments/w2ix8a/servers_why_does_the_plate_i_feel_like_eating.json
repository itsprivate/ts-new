Someone please educate me if Im wrong, this has been on my mind a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that servers aren’t paid a living wage so they rely on tips, everyone deserves a living wage but why do I have to pay a big tip for ordering a more expensive meal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;for example, if i order a $50 plate over day a cheaper $16 meal, I now have to tip the server more simply because I wanted the more expensive plate ??? what more work does the server do to deserve a bigger tip at that point? at this point i tip at least 18% when i go out (which isn’t often) but everytime i feel like it’s such a scam. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;by the way im not really talking about 18+% on only my meal, I mean when im in a group of 2+, now the servers gets a huge tip and I just dont see why. some severs definitely deserve it but i hate this pressure to tip everyone even when it seems they did absolutely nothing special. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i know they deal with garbage people everyday but so do so many other jobs. i’ve worked retail, i didn’t expect tips for interacting with rude people daily. what other reasons are there beside that that they deserve such big tips ? am i misunderstanding how much work they do ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;again, not trying to be rude, just so confused&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
