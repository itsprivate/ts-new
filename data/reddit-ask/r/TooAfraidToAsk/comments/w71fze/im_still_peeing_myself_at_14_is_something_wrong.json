Such as going to the bathroom several times before bed or not drinking anything for hours before bed it still happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it happen?\nObviously it still happens even when i prevent it physically so it might be a psychological issue. I have ADHD and severe anxiety and my parents are pretty neglectful of me so take your pick as to which is causing it cause I certainly don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who do i seek professionally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
