When thinking about having sex I would definitely take a shower beforhands. The thought of having sex with a penis through which piss left my body since the last time I´ve showered is kind of gross for me. As an example, if I would be in the opposite position I would dislike to have oral sex with my partner if he already went to toilet since the last shower. Therefore, I wouldn´t expect this from my partner either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, I heard someone say that person A hooked up with person B and as A arrived he first took a shower which the narrator compared to a behaviour you would find in a brothel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, is this a weird thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
