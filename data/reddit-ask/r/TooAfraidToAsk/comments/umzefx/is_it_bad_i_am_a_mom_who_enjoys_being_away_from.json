Yet I also enjoy breaks from my kids. My favorite time of day is dropping them off at school in the morning. Being a single working mom of four it’s tough and after going at it for a few weeks I’m glad at the thought of them going away to their dad for a while (he lives out of state so sees them once every month or two for a week). My friends do not understand how I feel because they say they live and breath their kids. I do not. I have a life outside my kids. They are a huge part of my life and I make sure their are well cared for. Yet they are not my whole life. Am I alone in feeling this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
