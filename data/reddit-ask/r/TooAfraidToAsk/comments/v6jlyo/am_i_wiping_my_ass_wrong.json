Poop details below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after I defecate, I wipe my butt with toilet paper until the paper comes up clean. But sometimes, especially if the poop has been uh, well-hydrated, I can wipe until the paper is clean and later get an itchy butt after walking around. When I go back to the bathroom and wipe more, there&amp;#39;s more shit. I hate this. Am I wiping wrong? How do I stop this? Is this normal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: All of y&amp;#39;all should be disclosing if you&amp;#39;re being paid by bidet companies haha. Consider the bidet recommended!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
