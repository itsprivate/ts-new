Nothing. I recently visited another country and made out with a girl at a bar who told me she wanted to go back to my hotel and mess around. She wasn&amp;#39;t even really my type and we didn&amp;#39;t end up hooking up but that felt better than cocaine. Like one of the peaks of the entire trip. Recently I hooked up with a friend of a friend. The first time was ok, the second time was probably the worst sex of my life. But the fact that she wanted to sleep with me? Better than ecstasy, by a long shot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t slept with a ton of people but I&amp;#39;ve been a bit more promiscuous recently. Even despite that, I crave people wanting me more than ever. For some background I was in an abusive relationship for 2 years and after it was over I went through almost a year without even kissing anyone and became really obsessed with it, thinking about it constantly and wanting someone to want me incessantly. Whenever I would express this to my friends it was basically always met with anger and annoyance, and the people who were the most insistent about how I shouldn&amp;#39;t be so upset about it and how it doesn&amp;#39;t matter were always the ones who slept around the most and had a rotating door of non-stop partners. I became really depressed and was incapable of tying my self worth to anything other than people wanting to sleep with me. After a while I figured out that I need to tell myself that I have value from other things like achievements and just inherently, but I still can&amp;#39;t help how it makes me feel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had another relationship and a number of hookups since the phase of obsession ended and I have a much healthier perspective on it but obviously aspects of it still linger. Now, I&amp;#39;ve been single for a while but I don&amp;#39;t even want a relationship anymore. I don&amp;#39;t want someone to be in love with me. I don&amp;#39;t want the genuine things right now. I&amp;#39;m in my early-mid 20&amp;#39;s and I want people to look at me and want to fuck me and that&amp;#39;s it. I want meaningless sex even if it sucks. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Is it wrong to just be desired? I can&amp;#39;t help it no matter what. I recently made a massive stride in my career and sure it felt good, but again probably 1/10th as good as making out with that girl at the bar. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m gonna try to stop rambling now I know most people have probably stopped reading. But is this wrong? Why do I feel this way? Should I not indulge these desires? I use condoms and get tested and don&amp;#39;t lead people on. For reference I&amp;#39;m mid 20&amp;#39;s M bisexual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
