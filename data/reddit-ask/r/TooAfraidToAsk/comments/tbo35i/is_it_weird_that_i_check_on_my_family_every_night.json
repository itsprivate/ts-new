  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m 18m and I live with my mom and 9yo sister. I’m always up late gaming and sleep around 5am. Every night when I go to use the bathroom or get water and I remember that they’re asleep, I do a little check up on them. I told a friend this and he said I was super weird and that he was uncomfortable knowing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s the usual routine: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I head to my moms room and her door is usually wide open. I usually just glance around the room and make sure she’s sleeping soundly.  I close or open her window depending on the temperature, make sure her phone is plugged in and being charged, turn the tv off if it’s really loud, sometimes I even have to put her blanket on her because it fell to the side of the bed, and lastly I turn the light off and close the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t even call that a process because usually it just takes a moment ya know? Most times it’s just me glancing around the room, turning the light off and closing the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just make sure everything’s in place and safe because my mom does sleep over at her boyfriends house sometimes and takes my sister so it’s kinda just routine to see if they’re home and I guess me checking on them might be weird but it’s just me making sure things are in order and they’re safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister has her own room too, I pretty much do the same thing with her but very rarely there are times she’s sleeping in positions that look unsafe or uncomfortable. Stuff like with her arm bent around her back, over her head, or sometimes it’s just her straight up sleeping FACE FIRST into a pillow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So sometimes I walk over and just… move her out of what I perceive as an unsafe or uncomfortable position, It never wakes her up either. this is rare but it happens probably at least once a month. Is this weird at all? maybe I have some mild OCD&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps Im kinda introverted so im often in my room with my door locked as Im online gaming and I’ve just gotten used to having it locked to avoid interaction and for some reason that makes me always wanna close my mom and sisters doors when they’re asleep too. And yeah I grew up poor so I always make sure the lights are off too&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: 19* turning 20 soon&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
