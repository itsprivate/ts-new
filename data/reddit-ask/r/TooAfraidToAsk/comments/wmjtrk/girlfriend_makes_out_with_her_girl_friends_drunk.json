We’re both straight, but once she and her friends (all girls) got drunk and accidentally let it spill that they all just got done making out while drunk. Am I wrong for being upset by this? I sort of just pretended like it didn’t bother me, but I think she could tell it did for a second. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this is a concern, how should I go about talking to her about it? I don’t want her to think I’m being controlling and I really like her friends and don’t want them thinking that either. It does bother me though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
