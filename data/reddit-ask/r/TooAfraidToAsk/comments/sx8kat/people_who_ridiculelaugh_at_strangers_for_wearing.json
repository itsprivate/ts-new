They don&amp;#39;t have to wear it, and they have no idea why we&amp;#39;re wearing ours (it&amp;#39;s not just about covid, it&amp;#39;s about pretty much any nasty virus, the flu, whatever). I really want to ask one of them if I see that kind of reaction again. But since my parents would be mortified, I&amp;#39;m asking here and hoping someone can explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
