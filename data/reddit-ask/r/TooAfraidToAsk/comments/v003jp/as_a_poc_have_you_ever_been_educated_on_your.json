WTF? How tone-deaf can you be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has told me how she prefers dating minorities and she does not trust white men.  She has suggested I wear my dashiki more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have two other woke white women friends who do the most tone-deaf things. Similarly, with the girl I mentioned above, they tell me how much they do not identify as white when they are indeed white ,they do not date white men and they prefer having minority friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had one of my woke white friends try to do my natural hair. She does not have curly hair and she does not have black relatives and she did not go to beauty school but she thought she could do my hair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is it socially acceptable to denigrate white men?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
