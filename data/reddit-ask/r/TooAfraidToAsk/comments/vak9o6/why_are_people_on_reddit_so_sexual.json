That’s so hot please tell me you fucked that garlic bread.” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like why? The first time I got a message it was random talk, asking my name, then it became, pretty quickly, sexual comments and questions that were totally inappropriate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It always starts with acting interested in the topic of the post, but as soon as you reply it turns weird. At first it feels good to know someone wants to talk or let me vent but it’s never been the case. Starts with asking where I’m from, what I look like, how tall I am or if I’m petite or curvy. Then they start asking sexual shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had posted before about sexual abuse and got a message from saying saying they got off to the idea of a child being… yeah. Like wtf? I reported the person but idk if anything came of it. I thought it would be a one time thing, but it keeps happening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I don’t reply they always try to act innocent, as if they didn’t mean it THAT way at all. They change the subject back to the topic of the post. But as soon as I start answering again it becomes sexual once more. It’s like predatory behavior… manipulative. Like wtf is up with reddit? Y’all are fucking weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
