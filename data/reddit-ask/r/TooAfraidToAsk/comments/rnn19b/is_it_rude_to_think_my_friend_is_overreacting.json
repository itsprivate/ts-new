  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend (18) had a miscarriage about two weeks ago. I lost my baby in a car accident on 11/08/2021. She has been comparing our situations and saying she understands what I’m going through now and it’s really hitting a nerve. Am I a jerk for saying that? My heart and soul is gone. I gave birth to my healthy boy and I had our lives planned out and then he died. She didn’t give birth or even take care of the pregnancy. She wanted her baby but her boyfriend (21) told her they’re too young, that he didn’t really want it, and that he was probably going to leave her. She found out she was pregnant two or three weeks before the miscarriage, but in that time she kept smoking weed and nicotine vapes, not washing or eating properly, and being generally unhealthy for even a woman who isn’t pregnant. It was not a surprise to me at first because of these facts. I helped her through it the day it happened best I could and I haven’t talked to her since. I know everybody grieves differently but I don’t see how she hurts this bad when she didn’t seem to do anything for her baby’s wellbeing. I don’t want to talk to her because it’s just so triggering to me, it’s hard to feel bad when I know how bad it can really be. So am I a jerk for thinking this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:: I’ve been friends with said friend since middle school, I love her to death!! I meant no harm saying these things I just wanted to give the full story. I appreciate the comments giving me different insights, I truly only saw it the way I stated above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
