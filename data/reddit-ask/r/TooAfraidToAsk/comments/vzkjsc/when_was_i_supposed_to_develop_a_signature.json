Mine is just my name written in my not very neat, non-cursive handwriting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one ever told me I needed to develop a signature. I had cursive lessons as a kid but I was very slow with it so I kept writing in print. It happened once when someone said &amp;quot;no, we need your signature here&amp;quot; and I said &amp;quot;yep that&amp;#39;s it&amp;quot; and they were a bit confused but moved on. It&amp;#39;s never really been an issue, I&amp;#39;ve signed official bank documents with no problems, but it&amp;#39;s a little embarrassing because it looks pretty bad/childish. Is it too late to develop an &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; signature now? I guess it&amp;#39;s more of an issue if your signature changes, than if your signature is childish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did anyone else not develop a signature? Or if you did, when?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
