Her dirtbag boyfriend (and father of the child) broke up with her right after the baby was born, so my sister and the baby moved back in with my parents and I.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were having a conversation about how she hasn&amp;#39;t had sex in so long and had to resort to her vibrator to release tension, and I realized that she had masturbated with the baby in the room. She didn&amp;#39;t think there was anything weird about that, and said she would even have sex with the baby there. Personally, I wouldn&amp;#39;t masturbate with a pet in the room, let alone a human baby. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that a newborn has no idea what&amp;#39;s going on, so it&amp;#39;s probably not a big deal. I have a lot of sexual hang ups, so I might be the weird one here. I&amp;#39;m totally not judging her, I just wanted to hear all you&amp;#39;re opinions on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
