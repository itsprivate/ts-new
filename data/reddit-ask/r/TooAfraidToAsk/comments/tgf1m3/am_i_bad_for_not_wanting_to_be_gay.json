If you&amp;#39;re gay and you want to express yourself, I wish I was like you and I support you for going forwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t sit right with me and I kinda wish I was straight. I have been accepted by my friends and family but it isn&amp;#39;t something that makes me really happy. I don&amp;#39;t feel whole or complete or accepting of who I am and I&amp;#39;ve been trying since 7th grade. (I&amp;#39;m in college now). Sometimes, I just don&amp;#39;t like feeling this way but it isn&amp;#39;t something I can control and it isn&amp;#39;t something that really makes me feel at peace with myself. I have considered taking Conversion Therapy a lot, but I&amp;#39;m too unsure and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever accept who I am. Yes I have gone to therapy, but I&amp;#39;m still feeling shitty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I think I&amp;#39;ve made up my mind and will just struggle. I&amp;#39;ve tried everything and I appreciate everyone here, but if conversion therapy is as bad as you all say it is, then I suppose that I&amp;#39;ll just struggle with myself instead since I can&amp;#39;t find a way to be happy with who I am. Thank You for your help&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I&amp;#39;M NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE, SO STOP GIVING IT TO ME, I&amp;#39;VE MADE UP MY MIND SO STOP FUCKING ASKING.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will no longer be responding or viewing comments anymore so if you want to try and &amp;quot;give me advice,&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;re wasting your time. This is how I&amp;#39;m going to live my life and that&amp;#39;s final.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
