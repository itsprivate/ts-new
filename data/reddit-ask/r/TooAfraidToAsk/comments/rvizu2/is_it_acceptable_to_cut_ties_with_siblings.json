I have 4 sisters, but only one is greedy, manipulative and self-serving. I have witnessed how she almost manipulated my parents into signing off land to her name, never paid debts she owed my parents, almost always causing them heart attacks. She blames all the people around her for her miseries in life. She releases foul, disrespectful words against anyone who differ opinions from her. She fakes illness so she can get sympathy. She can not hold an adult conversation, she is pleasant now and changes moods in a heartbeat. My other sisters are fine, but they tend to believe her lies. I have an avoidant personality and I just tend to step away from drama. I am doing OK not talking to her for 2 years now. I just feel more motivated now more than ever to continue cutting her off my life because I never would have to deal with her ever again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
