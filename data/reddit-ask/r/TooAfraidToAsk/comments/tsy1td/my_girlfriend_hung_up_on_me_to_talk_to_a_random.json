She told me one random dud approached her and started talking to her about her favourite football team(because she was wearing a jersey). Idk why but i thought it was wrong on her part to hang up straight away. And i got jealous and felt that im really low on her priority list. What should i do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
