But I haven&amp;#39;t gotten there yet.  I&amp;#39;m 26 and every girl my age I know has had at least 1 but I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about it for years now and just can&amp;#39;t pin down feeling one way or there other I&amp;#39;ve never felt like such a fence sitter. Does anyone have any advice to make the choice?  My husband has basically left the decision up to me since I&amp;#39;ll stay home full time with the baby and obvi have to go through childbirth.  We are in a pretty good place to have one but I can&amp;#39;t imagine how my life would change and what I want my future to look like involving kids. \n Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
