At the time I was dealing with some depression, but eventually over the years I got in to a healthier mental state. However, one thing that never changed, was my strange enjoyment of being alone. I&amp;#39;ve never been in a relationships and when people have asked if I&amp;#39;m seeing someone, I&amp;#39;ve said that I&amp;#39;m completely fine by myself, however people have looked at me differently because of that, as if I&amp;#39;m depressed or a loser or something. I spend most of my free time doing things such as watching movies, working out and just chillin by myself. Some people have said that one day I will change my mind about being alone, but they&amp;#39;ve been saying things like that for 5+ years and.. uhh.. I&amp;#39;m still pretty sure that being alone is what I like the most. It&amp;#39;s just so peaceful and there&amp;#39;s no drama. So my question is, is it normal to want be alone most of the time and have no desire for relationships?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
