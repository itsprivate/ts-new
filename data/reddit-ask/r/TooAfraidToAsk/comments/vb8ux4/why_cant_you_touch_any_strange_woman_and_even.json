Now I&amp;#39;m a 22 year old guy and when I was a kid I used to hug and kiss my family members whenever I met them, but it&amp;#39;s been awhile since I couldn&amp;#39;t do it. It&amp;#39;s really annoying. You know it&amp;#39;s ok with female strangers, but when it comes to your family, it&amp;#39;s unacceptable. That&amp;#39;s all.

So what&amp;#39;s wrong with us?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
