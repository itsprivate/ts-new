Granted, I’ve smiled along when she’s said she’s coming in my next trip but the truth is that I enjoy these trips myself. I have nothing to hide I might add! I just enjoy going out for a quiet expensed meal with everything paid for. I enjoy seeing colleagues outside of work in that city without feeling guilty that anyone is back in the hotel room alone or anything. It’s my own personal experience for MY work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, how do I tell my partner that I don’t really &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; her to come with me on these trips? I’m sure they’ll kick up a fuss regardless so I guess the question is, how do I tell them I want to go alone with minimal damage? Lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
