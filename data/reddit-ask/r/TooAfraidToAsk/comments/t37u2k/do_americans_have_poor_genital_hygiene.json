I can not imagine entering a sexual encounter unwashed enough for this to be an issue.\nAlso dick cheese is mostly just a collection of sweat and dead skin, which means even if the foreskin is removed that may remove all risk of dick cheese but if you’re cleaning infrequently enough for a considerable amount dick cheese to accumulate then chances are you’ve probably also got sweaty balls and swamp ass. Smegma also isn’t something that’s exclusive to males, but it’s just taken as a given that women know how to clean themselves before engaging in sexual activity. So I guess my question is do Americans have exceptionally poor genital hygiene to the point that everyone has a dick cheese horror story or is it more a sense of metaphysical speculation?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
