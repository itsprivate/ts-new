Anyways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My cat (8ish m/o male, not neutered) loves attention, especially belly rubs. He runs up to me and gets in my lap any chance he gets. Well, when it comes to belly rubs, he even lifts up his leg like a dog would. I thought it was so cute!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today he gets in my lap per usual, and gets on his back, basically telling me it was time for belly rubs, so I happy obliged. Well, I look down and his little red rocket is not only sticking out....but MOVING AROUND. If that thing had eyes it would be looking me up and down, maybe even fucking whistle at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t the first time his little friend has come out. But I figured that like other animals, this meant that they are relaxed, so I didn&amp;#39;t see it as an issue. But like....he gets this fucking look in his eye. And his genital area was...wet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...Reddit, have I been fucking jerking off my cat this whole time??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
