Nations across the world are heavily indebted and I don&amp;#39;t understand where the money is supposed to come from. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The speech was directed to leaders of nations and businesses, so if everyone chips in &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; a few millions, I guess we could get to the $10B a month but if that&amp;#39;s possible, I am wondering why they were not able to get that much money together for other issues such as climate change or world hunger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, please share your thoughts, perhaps you have a different perspective on this topic that broadens my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
