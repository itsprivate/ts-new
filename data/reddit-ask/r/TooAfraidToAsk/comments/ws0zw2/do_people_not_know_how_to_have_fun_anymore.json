  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t smoke or do drugs because of work. I’ve smoked weed before, but not anymore and idk I feel like I’d rather not do it again. It’s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it’s like every time I hang out with friends, they always want to be high.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, we would just be setting up for a volleyball game at a park and everyone’s like “hold up before that let’s all take a hit.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like every single occasion — hiking, dining, arcade, bowling, etc., it’s “Yo bro lemme get your pen,” “Yo bro lemme take a pull, this food is a boutta hit diff,” “I’m so smacked broo (LMAO)”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like you can’t just enjoy the food sober? Y’all can’t enjoy a peaceful hike and appreciate nature? I just wanna play some football, some sports, get fking exhausted, eat some good ass food, and crash at home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean as the sober one of the group it’s funny watch them laugh at literally nothing and just talk random shit. But sometimes I just want to have a regular, sober chat about things. And it doesn’t feel all that “fitting” to talk about that in an atmosphere where one dude is sober and his friends are all high. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like i’d be killing the vibe. Like why would I ask “yo bro how’s work, how’s your family doing” when everyone else’s like “Yo why is the floor mad dry LMAO” or some random shit. In these cases all of our conversations are usually random asf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, for concerts and raves, it’s like everybody NEEDS to be on something to enjoy the music. “Yooo the drop is a boutta hit diff”. Am I the only one who can vibe and dance to the music sober? People can do the same but would rather experience it high it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s better though when I’m tipsy or drunk, like better in a way that I could be on their mental level while they’re high, whenever we go hang out. I totally worded that in a weird way but hope you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
