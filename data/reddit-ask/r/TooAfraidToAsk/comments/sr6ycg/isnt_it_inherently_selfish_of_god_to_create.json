I thought about this in middle school and just moved on as something we just wouldn’t understand because we’re humans but I’m back at this point so here we are. If God is perfect and good why did he make humans, knowing we’d bring sin into the world and therefore either go to heaven or hell. I understand that hell is just an existence without God which is supposedly everything good in life, so it’s just living in eternity without anything good. But if God knew we would sin and He is so good that he hates sin and has to send us to hell, why didn’t he just not make us? Isn’t it objectively better to not exist than go to hell? Even at the chance of heaven, because if we didn’t exist we wouldn’t care about heaven because we wouldn’t be “we.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
