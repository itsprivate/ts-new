Box braids being apart of my african culture, i love sharing it with other people. I dont see anything wrong with non-black people wearing braids from my culture. It actually makes me happy. Im confused as to why its so looked down on. I think its a beautiful thing to see people wanting to try hairstyles from my culture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ive seen a lot of non-black celebrities get hate for wearing any type of extension braids. It honestly makes me a bit sad. I also dont understand why someone would care so mych about someone elses hair. I mean, as long as they arent being disrespectful to my culture, then whats the problem?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If im being ignorant please tell me! This is a genuine question&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
