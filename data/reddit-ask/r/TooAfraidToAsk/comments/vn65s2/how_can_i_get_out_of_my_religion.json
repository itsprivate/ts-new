Please know that I have made the conscious decision to be baptized in this religion during my teen years so my religion has nothing to do with me wanting to go out. Its just that, I do not want to do anything about my spirituality these past years. I just want to do things the way other people do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a Jehovah&amp;#39; Witness, btw. So, I think it&amp;#39;s really important for me to disconnect myself from them as I am no longer willing to preach about God, attend services and do the exact opposite of what the preacher says every Sunday, and be part of any campaign about JWs. Whenever I get cold and simply exit by not attending a single service, a member of my religion try to win me but everytime they do it, I get pretty upset about it. And it makes me feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
