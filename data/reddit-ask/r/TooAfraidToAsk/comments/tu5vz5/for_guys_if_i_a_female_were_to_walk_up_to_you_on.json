I want to go up to an unassuming guy and do the whole “oh my god Matt there you are, I’ve been looking all over for you!” but I feel that a guy would either not get it or I’d be too uneasy that he is another person to fear to even go through with it. I ask specifically for guys just because there is a notable paucity of women walking around at night (I wonder why) and so a guy would likely be my only option for support. If a woman went up to you in this manner, would you be able to catch on that they were feeling unsafe or being followed?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
