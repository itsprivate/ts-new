  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My gf and I used to have lots of sex. We were so attracted to each other. A couple years passed, she got on birth control, then got off, and she just seems to have grown out of wanting sex. It went from every other day, to once a week, to every other week, and now its been a month. Whenever we do, it seems like she wants us both to cum as fast as possible. She says she still loves me, shows me affection and shows me she cares about me but there is no sex. Every time I try, she shuts it down and says she’s not in the mood. Or she will deny until she has to go somewhere and makes excuses like “oh i was in the mood but i just got a little sick” or “I dont have time”. I’ve tried so many different ways, found all the things she likes/doesnt like, but it still doesnt work out. I’ve tried talking to her about it many times but she always finds a way to make me feel awful about it. It makes me feel so unwanted, unattractive, and really fucks with my head. At the same time, I feel like a scumbag for wanting sex so much all the time, but she’s my gf, who else would I want it from? I feel stuck. I love her so much and I dont want to move on but this is so so hard for me. Am I wrong for feeling this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: i have spoken with her multiple times about this but cant seem to get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit pt 2: l just want to thank everyone here for offering me some insight into this. Im beginning to see the ugly truth and while it is painful, its a relief to know that I’m not alone and there is a way out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
