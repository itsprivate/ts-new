I&amp;#39;ve always felt inferior to everyone because I felt like everyone was handed this mysterious instruction manual of life and I didn&amp;#39;t get it. Like I&amp;#39;m dumber or more naive than every other person on the planet. Or more dishonest, less worthy of the space I take up, just somehow less than everyone. And that everyone around me is walking around doing everything just right, know exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing and I&amp;#39;m just out here doing everything wrong and being a complete moron and a fuck up no matter how hard I try. I&amp;#39;ve always felt like a sham and, imposter and a liar compared to most people. And I don&amp;#39;t associate myself with them because of it. Because I feel like they&amp;#39;re Superior to me in some way - like they&amp;#39;re the real adults and I&amp;#39;m the child and I don&amp;#39;t deserve to be around them, be friends with them or even think of having a relationship. Even among people my own age I feel like a total fake and I&amp;#39;m here just a little kid in adults clothes playing pretend doing things I&amp;#39;m unqualified to do like operating a cash register, having my own place or a friend with benefits. Like everyone else is doing it right and I&amp;#39;m just doing it wrong!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even take myself seriously as an adult because of my height. I mean I&amp;#39;m 4&amp;#39;11. Most adults are much bigger than that and I look completely ridiculous going into work like a 12-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I wonder.. is it possible these people are every bit as clueless as I am? About what the proper protocol is during dating? Jobs? Getting into the right college or finding the right place to move? Making friends as an adult? Is it possible that these people are actually my equals and are just blundering around as stupidly as I am but they just pretend they know what they&amp;#39;re doing? Or does everybody else have some mysterious instruction manual to life that I don&amp;#39;t have and I&amp;#39;m inferior somehow for some reason? What&amp;#39;s really going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
