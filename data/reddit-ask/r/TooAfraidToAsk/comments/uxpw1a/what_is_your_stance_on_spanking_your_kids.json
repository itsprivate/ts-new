I was raised by a very loving single mother. She worked extremely hard, and even though we didn’t have much, she gave everything she had to my brother and I. Sometimes, we would misbehave (an example being running around and screaming in a store when we were about six), and after telling us to stop repeatedly, she would spank us. I don’t harbor any feelings about it, I don’t feel abused, I love her dearly. But whenever I mention this to someone they say “oh my god, that’s awful, you were clearly abused by her”. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I strongly disagree with that assumption. My whole family (both sides) did this to their kids up until the kids were more mature (maybe seven or so). It’s just how everyone was raised. Is this a problem?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel the need to add that my whole family is black, and when I mention the spanking thing to people of color, they share similar experiences and see no issue with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
