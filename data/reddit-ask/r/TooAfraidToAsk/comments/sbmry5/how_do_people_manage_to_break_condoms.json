He&amp;#39;s well hung, so he fits very snuggly into every condom we&amp;#39;ve used, including the ones we use now which are marketed as ultra thin with minimal lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We love to get rough, and despite that, we&amp;#39;ve never had a single condom break. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter what position we&amp;#39;re in or how hard we go at it, it has always stayed intact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why is it that I hear of so many people having this issue with condoms breaking? I&amp;#39;ve seen some people online say they don&amp;#39;t use condoms because of how easily they break. Do people store their condoms in a hot car or something? do you keep a condom in your wallet for months and still use it? Whether it&amp;#39;s a matter of brand or improper storage or something else.. how in the hell do people manage to break them?? I can fit my foot in one of those things! I can fill it with a shit ton of water and it still doesn&amp;#39;t break! so what gives??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
