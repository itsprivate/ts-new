So when I clean out my hair (I only take it from the top, I don&amp;#39;t remove the entire drain), it always has some nasty ass sperm sticking to it, guess it gets stuck to my long hair on the way down the drain. :( &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#39;t know these guys very well. 2 I haven&amp;#39;t spoken to more than twice since moving in a month ago. They seem to stay in their rooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I even approach this? Am I doomed and should just move?
