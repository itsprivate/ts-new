Texas has been unable to import power from other areas when they lost generation capacity due to the storm. The lack of interconnection was deliberate, supposedly to avoid federal mandates that came with the regulatory authority to interconnect. What were those mandates they avoided? The cost for not having the interconnects is obvious today. What did Texas gain from not interconnecting?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
