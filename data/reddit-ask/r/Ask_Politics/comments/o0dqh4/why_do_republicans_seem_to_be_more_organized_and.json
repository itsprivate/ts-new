It could have always been this way, and I just never noticed it so clearly. But, there seems to be a LOT more long-term strategy and maneuvering by Republicans than there does with Democrats. For example, in the news right now are stories about McConnell and his SCOTUS interference previously and going forward. Part of that interference was how only a handful of Obama judicial appointments were allowed to go through during his term, but then the GOP pounced immediately when Trump was president and confirmed more than 200 judges, not to mention of course the 3 SCOTUS picks. This seems like it was a long-term plan by the GOP to execute when the moment was right, which they saw coming and could bide their time.</p>\n\n<p>Democrats on the other hand seem to be very fickle, or at least not able to have any top-down leadership that can implement plans beyond just winning individual elections etc. Is it because the progressive/liberal element of the Democratic party is trying to assert more power in the party, and the old-guard doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s the right direction, which causes them to focus on the short-term rather than long-term? Conservatives have always been dominant in the Republican party, where it doesn&#39;t seem that the far-left in the Democratic party have ever been even close to dominant.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like Democrats are playing checkers, and the Republican party is playing chess. In my mind, that ability comes from real power holders in the parties setting the tone and direction, which for whatever reason doesn&#39;t seem to be happening on any significant level with Democrats.  </p>\n\n<p>Another component of this seems to be that Republicans are willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish their goals (&quot;ends justify the means&quot;) and don&#39;t care how it looks, yet they still get their voters to turn out -- maybe exactly BECAUSE they do this. One example would be stonewalling Obama&#39;s SCOTUS pick and saying it&#39;s because of the election year etc, then having zero shame in turning around and pushing through ACB immediately before the next election. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s going on?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
