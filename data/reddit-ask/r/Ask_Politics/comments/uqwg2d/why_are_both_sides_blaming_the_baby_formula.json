Especially when so much of the nation&amp;#39;s supply is coming out of that one plant? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we so far gone that we will find it acceptable to sicken or kill a few babies if it means a company can hit it&amp;#39;s quarterly goals, the only reason to not do that is if government regulators come down on them?  Yet so many people are complaining about government getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ll get on my soapbox and say that other than the cost of the downtime and cleaning, it won&amp;#39;t harm the company.   They have like 60% of the market, no one is coming in and competing with them even though lots of people will be yelling capitalism will take care of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
