I don&amp;#39;t know much about it, but my (possibly wrong) impression of the field is that it&amp;#39;s very, well, diverse. Lots of different viewpoints regarding different problems and questions - so not really &amp;quot;objectively&amp;quot; definable in, say, the way science can prove the speed of light is equivalent to 299 792 458 meters/second, or that humans generally take nine months to give birth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any philosophical topics that were once the rage of the party - debated fiercely, to the death, perhaps - that are now settled, solved questions. Of course, I suppose that calls into question whether you can &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; a topic in any concrete sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To define it more simply, so, if we assume we can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; something - say, what about an supermajority-type agreed consensus on a topic that was once, say, fiercly split or contested? (I suppose, as much as there can be an agreed consensus in philosophy...)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
