Divorces reason from history. Divorces reason from experience. Because we don&amp;#39;t have direct experience of reality according to Kant.&amp;quot; Goes on for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a 3-minute clip of that segment: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzIZIYLKK0Y\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzIZIYLKK0Y&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does he mean by this? Does he actually know what he is talking about or is it some misinterpretation of Kant&amp;#39;s philosophy? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, feel free to comment on any other statements that pique your interest, am genuinely curious, because as a philosophy newbie, although he is speaking with great confidence my intuition is telling me that he doesn&amp;#39;t know what he is talking about because it can&amp;#39;t be that simple.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
