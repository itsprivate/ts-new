Like, there are 5 prominent defenders of position A, 5 of position B, 5 of position C, and none of them thinks the available evidence presented to them over 3-4 decades changes anything, they just happened to get it right all along? How plausible is this? Say between 1980 and 2010 they just didn&#39;t see anything that prompted them to change their take on the human mind, mathematics, science, logic, or whatever topic they philosophize about?</p>\n\n<p>And aren&#39;t there all sorts of other forces at work? For example the fact that being an expert on position A for 2 decades is a pleasant position to be in, the psychology of admitting defeat, the fact that putting something to rest isn&#39;t great for maybe the PhD students of that person or their department, if those want to research this? Does anyone actually believe all that&#39;s going on is evaluating evidence?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
