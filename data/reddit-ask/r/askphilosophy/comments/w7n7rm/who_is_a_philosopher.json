But it seems wrong to me considering many of the existent philosophers who don&amp;#39;t meet this criterion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, Diogenes was a great philosopher who didn&amp;#39;t even own a piece of paper and lived on the streets and still is more famous and influential than 99% of people who graduated from university in the last decade. And as far as I know, he wasn&amp;#39;t liked by his peers at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, Socrates didn&amp;#39;t even believe in writing and wouldn&amp;#39;t even be able to get into university nowadays. Was he not a philosopher?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, Thoreau argues in Walden about Philosophers saying:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success, not kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by conformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the progenitors of a nobler race of men. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that being a philosopher is something that transcends the walls of universities and writing and can be understood in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, who is a philosopher?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
