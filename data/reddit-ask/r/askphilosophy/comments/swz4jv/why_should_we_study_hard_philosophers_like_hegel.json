He has no time for people like Hegel, Heidegger, Deleuze and Kant, he calls them deadwood. He said they are too up themselves and they are not good writers. He believes that the role of a good writer and philosopher is to be understood, which he argues Hegel and people like him are not understandable. He likes Locke, Hobbes, Popper. Now, of course, I didn&amp;#39;t like hearing this and he hasn&amp;#39;t read any Heidegger and he has only read a summary of Hegel&amp;#39;s Philosophy of History. But his challenge and negation of technical philosophers remains. Why should we study Hegel? Why can&amp;#39;t Hegel just be clearer, why speak about ontology or metaphysics when we can just speak psychologically and with common sense ? Why not get rid of the deadwood. His question is why justify a deep study of Hegel and technical philosophy? I am interested to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
