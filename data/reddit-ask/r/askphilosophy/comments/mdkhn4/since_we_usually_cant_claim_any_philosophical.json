  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>One could respond to my question in itself, but here is the picture I have in mind: philosophical positions hang together in a <strong>web of belief</strong>, whose nodes are the positions and whose edges (or perhaps &quot;edges&quot; shaped like neural connections, since inferences often have multiple premises) are inferences or arguments or reasons. Each node has a degree of plausibility or probability and each edge has a degree of strength.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Philosophical problems</strong> are tensions or incoherences or contradictions within the web. The aim of philosophy, then, would be a <strong>reflective equilibrium of the web of belief</strong>, or a reassignment of plausibilities assigned to the various positions such that these incoherences are resolved and explanatory coherence is maximised. Arguably, this explicates the aim of philosophy according to Sellars (&quot;to understand how things...hang together&quot;), since explanations are accounts that provide understanding. Like science, the Duhem-Quine thesis holds for philosophy too: it&#39;s impossible to test philosophical theories in isolation, but only as a corporate body with auxiliary assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>visual animation</strong> I have in mind of the reflective equilibrium is something like a <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\">3Blue1Brown video on neural network learning algorithms</a> but instead of adjusting the strength of connections (presumably we can&#39;t do so here since the strength of an inference is fixed) we adjust strength of node (i.e. plausibility of a position). And instead of being linear, it is holistic like Quine&#39;s web of belief. And instead of optimising towards matching some supervised learning data, we optimise towards explanatory coherence or perhaps towards the <strong>epistemic standards that the web of belief legislates upon itself (I am evoking themes from pragmatism or naturalism or Kuhn or Hegel or Quine or Sellars or Kant or self-correcting, self-improving AI; immanence, not transcendence)</strong>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
