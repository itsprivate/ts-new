Everything that exists in the universe seems to be just as natural as everything else. The idea that humans and what they create is somehow fundamentally different from all the remaining existence seems to be nothing more than unwarranted exceptionalism and the result of using double standards. It&#39;s almost as if we define &quot;natural&quot; to mean everything except for what we humans do but that seems quite stupid to me. I don&#39;t understand why a beaver dam should be considered any more natural than the dams we build. We&#39;re animals. And we change our environment. We change it in a fairly unique way as far as our planet is concerned but it doesn&#39;t change the fact we&#39;re just another species morphing its surroundings to better suit its needs. if we humans do something, it&#39;s automatically natural. Bizarre sexual fetishes, experiments on humans, in-vitro, gene enhancements, etc. it&#39;s all perfectly natural on the ground that we do it.</p>\n\n<p>Then there is supposed supernatural part. My problem with it is that even if we discover that magic, souls, gods etc. exist, there is no reason why we shouldn&#39;t just include all those entities within the natural world. Why wouldn&#39;t we just consider the natural world to be much bigger and richer?</p>\n\n<p>We can still use the word &quot;unnatural&quot; to make a statistical judgement or the word &quot;supernatural&quot; to refer to something yet unknown but fundamentally everything appears to be equally natural.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
