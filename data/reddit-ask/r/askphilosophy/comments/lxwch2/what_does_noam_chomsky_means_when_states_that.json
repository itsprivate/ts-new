According to the propaganda model, both liberal and conservative wings of the media, whatever those terms are supposed to mean, fall within the same framework of assumptions. In fact, if the system functions well, it ought to have a liberal bias, or at least appear to, because if it appears to have a liberal bias, that will serve to bound thought even more effectively. In other words, if the press is indeed adversarial and liberal, and all these bad things, then how can I go beyond it? They&#39;re already so extreme in their opposition to power that to go beyond it would be to take off from the planet, so therefore it must be that the presuppositions that are accepted in the liberal media are sacrosanct. Can&#39;t go beyond them. And a well-functioning system would in fact have a bias of that kind. The media would then serve to say, in effect: Thus far and no further. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What exactly does he mean by this? Is he saying that opposition to power, by definition, is liberal?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
