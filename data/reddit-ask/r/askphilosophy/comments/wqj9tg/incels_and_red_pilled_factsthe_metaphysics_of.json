Essence of women is X, either facts directly support it or implicitly hide it. One example: \nFact: female breadwinners make 38% of opposite-sex marriages with working wives(81% percent of overall opposite-sex marriages have working wives).

His response was a almost akin to a Schizophrenic rambling about the deep state, half muttered points about the happiness of those marriages, divorce rate, etc. I couldn’t get through to him. This reminded me of Fanon’s Black Skin White Mask, any other works diving into the metaphysics of bigotry?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
