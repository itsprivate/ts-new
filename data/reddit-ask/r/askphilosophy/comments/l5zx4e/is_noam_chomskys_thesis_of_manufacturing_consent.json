  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Per Chomsky on the origin of the title for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EuwmWnphqII?t=1508\"><em>Manufacturing Consent</em></a>:</p>\n\n<p><em>In a military state or in a feudal state, or what you would nowadays call a totalitarians state, it doesn&#39;t much matter what people think, because you&#39;ve got a bludgeon over their head, and you can control what they do. But when the state loses the bludgeon, when you can&#39;t control people by force, and when the voice of the people can be heard, you have this problem; it may make people so curious and so arrogant that they don&#39;t have the humility to submit to a civil rule, and therefore you have to control what people think...</em></p>\n\n<p><em>And the standard way to do this to resort to what in more honest days used to be called propaganda, manufacture of consent, creation of necessary illusions, various ways of either marginalizing the general public, or reducing them to</em> <strong><em>apathy.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Chomsky&#39;s notion is that people, when left to their devices, will systematically look for ways to subvert authority, and in order to make sure people either can&#39;t coalesce into a solidly united movement with definitive values, or cannot agree among themselves who the real abusers of authority and power are, those with the power to control media narratives seek to instill apathy within the consumers of media.</p>\n\n<p>But this seems at odds with what we now know about headlines and similar content on the internet that goes viral. Media companies want eyes on their pages so that they can sell advertising space. This viewership is measured by the number of &quot;clicks&quot; a title or thumbnail can generate. The studies measuring clickbait efficacy have shown over and over again that titles which agitate, prod, beget controversy, or overall foster an emotion of anger produce the most &quot;clicks&quot;, and hence are progenerated on media platforms the most. This is not congruent with the claim that media&#39;s role in a democracy is to produce apathy.</p>\n\n<p>In fact it seems to be obvious that much of the pre-internet media industry was comfortable tuning into people&#39;s youthful needs to be rebellious, curious, and in opposition to authority. I recall my parents attempt to shelter me from pop-media because, according to their view of the world, pop-culture narrative prevalent in media exercised no restraint ridiculing politicians, conflating success with greed, painting cops as squares, or otherwise encouraging alternate modes of thought from old-fashioned ideas. It&#39;s probably apparent that my parents were deeply conservative. Still, I would hardly call their worldview and the entire Trump camp the product of apathy.</p>\n\n<p>I think there is deeper evidence against Chomsky&#39;s assertion that narratives are systematically controlled in the mere existence of Q-Anon. Not only are the successful narratives provocative, they aren&#39;t even centralized. Q-Anon was devised by a number of independent propagandists who took advantage of an overlooked consequence of the internet: In some places, every user is assumed to be a trusted user. A movement which led to a third of the United States believing that November&#39;s democratic elections were fraudulent took over the Republican party without even requiring vetted professionals, cited documentation, or a platform. I took logic and linguistics in college and respect the importance of Chomsky&#39;s contribution to the sciences, but on the other hand I can&#39;t help but feel that <em>Manufacturing Consent</em> is a piece of fear-mongering propaganda itself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
