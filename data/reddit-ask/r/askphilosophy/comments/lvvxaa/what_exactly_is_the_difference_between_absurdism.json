Both recognize the that existence is meaningless but both also believe in subjective meaning, that we as human beings give it. Now I know that in Absurdism there is the recognition of the human desire to find meaning in a meaningless world (the absurd). Is that not the same as existentialism? In Absurdism you embrace the absurd and recognize the pointlessness of all meanings but still create subjective meaning in spite of that to make yourself happy. Does it differ from existentialism because it believes in subjective meaning also being pointless while in existentialism subjective meaning isn’t pointless? What exactly am I missing?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
