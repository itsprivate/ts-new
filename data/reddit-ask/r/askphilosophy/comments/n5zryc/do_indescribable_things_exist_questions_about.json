  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was reading about Russell&#39;s Paradox earlier today. I don&#39;t really understand the depths of set theory or formal logic, so I tried to comprehend it using natural language terms. Then I got to think about something that I&#39;m asking in the title of this thread.</p>\n\n<p>(Preface: I&#39;m a translator by trade. I didn&#39;t study philosophy of language or translation studies rigorously, however! I think I picked up some concepts while reading about topics like untranslatability, though.)</p>\n\n<p>To elaborate, I think my question has three parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do things that cannot be observed exist?</li>\n<li>Do things that cannot be talked about exist?</li>\n<li>Do things that cannot be thought exist?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think the concept of &quot;existing&quot; in these questions is going to be supremely important and defining what counts as &quot;existing&quot; may break them in half or not. But I don&#39;t know how to define &quot;existing&quot; in a useful way here. For the benefit of your answer, however, I&#39;m thinking of &quot;existing&quot; here in the way that numbers &quot;exist&quot; - I don&#39;t know if they exist as concrete things or conceptual things, but they certainly don&#39;t not exist.</p>\n\n<p>The first question - &quot;Do things that cannot be observed exist?&quot; - probably has the most to do with physics among these questions. I feel like this is the easiest to answer, but it was the starting point of this train of thought. Perhaps these &quot;things that cannot be observed&quot; might be something like potential sub-quantum qualities, counterintuitive dimensions of fundamental strings, physics within the event horizon, or the universe beyond our light cone.</p>\n\n<p>Things that our current physical theories cannot observe or determine might be beyond our confirmation/comprehension and might be forever beyond that, but does that fact <em>change</em> its existence? Is there something happening within the planck length even if there is no way to observe/determine it? Can things happening around a singularity within an event horizon falsify physical hypotheses if it&#39;s impossible to learn about them?</p>\n\n<p>And the stepping point to the next question is... if string theory turns out to be false, <em>do weird dimensions of strings stop existing?</em> If the theory that led to these statements turns out to be false, then those statements cannot be useful, right? But does that mean they <em>stop</em> existing? Has the lumineferous aether stopped existing?</p>\n\n<p>The second question - &quot;Do things that cannot be talked about exist?&quot; - probably has more to do with language. It&#39;s the one that confused me the most. Moving beyond physics stuff, could a similar thinking as above apply to things that can be expressed? In another way, are there things that are indescribable?</p>\n\n<p>I googled this question and I got <a href=\"https://linus.coffee/note/indescribable/\">this blog post</a> which I found interesting. But I get a deep sense of disagreement with it, however. Perhaps it&#39;s because untranslatable words are often on my mind - there are words that don&#39;t really correspond to any concise expression in other languages. (After more than a decade at translating Korean and English, I haven&#39;t found a way to translate <em>han</em> in Korean to English without breaking the translation in half.)</p>\n\n<p>But, turning that around, maybe that means concepts that cannot be succinctly described in any language can be succinctly described in <em>another</em> language. Even if that useful language is <em>made up on the spot</em>. Like formal logic statements. They are not &quot;real&quot; language, but they describe things that require lengthy paragraphs in a succinct way.</p>\n\n<p>Take away that sunccinctness and a new conlang for one specific thing might not even be necessary. It&#39;s probably no longer precise and faithful. Calling <em>han</em> by itself describes what <em>han</em> is far more precisely and faithfully than calling <em>han</em> &quot;socially repressed form of sorrowful rage prevalent in modern Korean culture, which many describe to have no clear emotional resolution condition by definition&quot;. But that mouthful sentence does describe <em>han</em> effectively enough, that the Korean word <em>han</em> isn&#39;t necessary for the referent to be seen as &quot;existing&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This could go on to language game extremes, like does the word &quot;indescribable&quot; describe all things that cannot be described otherwise? Does &quot;something that is neither only true nor only false&quot; describe everything beyond two-valued logic? Does that description mean that such a thing exists?</p>\n\n<p>Tying this to the blog post linked - does describing indescribable things as &quot;indescribable&quot; make linguistic expression uncountably infinite? This language manipulation seems to allow an expression to express itself, not itself, and everything beyond that by referring to itself.</p>\n\n<p>The third question - &quot;Do things that cannot be thought exist?&quot; - feels... absurd to me, but it seems like a final extension. Are there things that someone cannot think about?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you cannot think &quot;how <a href=\"/u/szp\">/u/szp</a> experiences the color green&quot; with all the phenomenology and qualia and whatnot entailed, but that quoted sentence <em>does</em> make it possible for you to <em>think</em> it. It certainly offers no information about the actual thing, but you can <em>think</em> it regardless of its meaninglessness.</p>\n\n<p>Are there such things as &quot;furious sleep of colorless green ideas&quot; because one can say the words &quot;colorless green ideas sleep furiously&quot;? If the referent is <em>defined by</em> the reference, and mental imagining is less restricted than linguistic expression... then... do things that cannot be thought exist?</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t know how to elaborate on the third question since it&#39;s so broad.</p>\n\n<p>So those are my questions. I could have searched for more information on this topic (since this sounds like something epistemologists, language philosophers and so on would have debated for centuries already) but I was not really sure how to phrase it!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
