Aka: gender self-identification&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P4: Since people can identify as any gender and since gender is a social construct, what a man is is determined by the person identifying themselves as one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Gender can be almost anything a person wants their gender to be, therefore Gender Self-Identification is correct&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree with P1 and P2. But I think I have a problems with P3 and P4. If a man can be whatever a person wants it to be, then why would they identify as such in the first place? By saying you are a “man” are you not at least applying SOME of the binary characteristics to yourself? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By saying a man can be anything, are you not applying the very thing you just said, that a man can be anything? Wouldn’t that be circular?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I am not confusing anyone, I have no issue with transgendered people at all. I am just confused of gender self-id theory. I mean no disrespect!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
