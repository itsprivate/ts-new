I am tired of just typing “x subject books” into the google search bar because the books that google recommend are not at all what my philosophy professors recommend. Is there a method you follow if you want to learn a new subject? I am already aware of the SEP but that can not be all that graduate students or self-taught learners use.</p>\n\n<p>Also do most people choose to read books or papers? I was told books is common for intro level or beginners but papers are key as you get upper level.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
