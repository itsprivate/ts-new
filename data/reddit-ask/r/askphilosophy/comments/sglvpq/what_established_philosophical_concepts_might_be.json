But for example, of the concepts I&amp;#39;m at least superficially familiar with, &lt;em&gt;Social Contract Theory&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;State of Nature&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ressentiment&lt;/em&gt; are among some of the ideas which seem at least partially attributable to many of the attitudes that seem to be representative of the current movement. As I said, I acknowledge that I&amp;#39;m not extremely well-versed in these ideas, so I&amp;#39;d rather not go in length about the associations I&amp;#39;ve been making; I&amp;#39;m more interested in the connections that might be made by someone with a greater depth of knowledge here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as in the title, what concepts, terms, or books come to mind when thinking about the deeper causes behind the Antiwork movement, the outcomes it may incite, or potential events it might precede?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
