This is super exciting and I&#39;m grateful for that opportunity :) For those not familiar with the competition, both the national olympiad and the international olympiad require students to write a text in English discussing one of four quotes.</p>\n\n<p>Now, English is my second language and all of my philosophy education thus far, except for some individual reading, has all been in Dutch. I think I&#39;m a fairly competent writer overall, but translating the philosophies to English is a bit hard for me because of the amount of jargon that&#39;s used. I guess I mostly think about this stuff in Dutch so my English representation of some ideas is lacking/not really good. That&#39;s why I&#39;d like to explore some of the ideas as they are described in English to get used the &quot;peculiar&quot; (in a positive way) writing style used in philosophy as well as expand my knowledge about philosophy with some more in-depth material than we usually discuss in my high school class. So basically I think I&#39;m looking for an undergraduate level textbook that covers some of the most influential philosophers. I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion for a good book or maybe some resources that could be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
