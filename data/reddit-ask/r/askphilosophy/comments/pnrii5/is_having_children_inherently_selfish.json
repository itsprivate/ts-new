To be clear, I&#39;ve never studied philosophy in any serious sense, but I deal with personal struggles that often lead me to philosophical problems.

I&#39;m not taking into account accidents and the like.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since some of my friends had kids, I&#39;ve been thinking about whether I&#39;ll end up having kids. When I was a kid myself I used to think having kids was a given. But I&#39;ve sort of &quot;discovered&quot; a part of me that thinks &quot;what gives me the right to have children?&quot;. This part of me feels like it&#39;s inherently wrong that I have the power to create an other person, like it&#39;s too much power. I don&#39;t feel like I &quot;arrived&quot; at this conclusion, it started as a feeling.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s obviously natural to reproduce, but with this level of awareness and consideration behind it, I struggle to find a good reason. To continue my family&#39;s legacy? Because I want to raise a child? Because I want company? Maybe I don&#39;t want to be alone when I&#39;m old? The only thing I feel is that it would be sad if my family and disappeared with me. But does that justify it? Why should I have the power to create life? Aren&#39;t all reasons for having kids inherently selfish? No matter how I look at it it feels like I&#39;m creating someone <strong>for</strong> something that will benefit me or society. Is that fair?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
