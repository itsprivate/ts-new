I have been thinking about topics related to representation and causation, and have begun, in response, delving into philosophical literature. One thing I&amp;#39;ve realized is how often philosophical language is used in scientific text despite the authors not having much of a philosophical background. Sometimes, this is taken to the worst case scenario where a scientist will themselves write philosophy without a solid understanding of the field they believe they&amp;#39;re contributing to. It seems like this is a problem unique from just learning philosophy for the first time, as these scientists have usually already published many times, and are used to having their voices heard. I&amp;#39;m not saying people can&amp;#39;t cross disciplines, and I think specialists in a field can sometimes offer unique insights into philosophical problems. However, I would like to avoid as many mistakes as I can if possible. I can&amp;#39;t avoid using language steeped in philosophical meaning, and I have a job I need to do, so it&amp;#39;s not the case that I can just wait until I know enough to continue my research or publications. But if I can avoid major mistakes as I continue to learn that would be ideal. My field is particularly tricky as I sit in the cross-roads of people doing work on consciousness, the sense of self, the sense of others, representation, memory, etc. It feels like a philosophical juggernaut being run by engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
