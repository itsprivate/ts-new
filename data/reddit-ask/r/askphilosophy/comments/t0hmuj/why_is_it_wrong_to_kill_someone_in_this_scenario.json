He wishes to continue living his life this way- he is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now lets say, I were to KILL him. I would give him no clue of this so he won&amp;#39;t be stressed. And i will somehow, magically and INSTANTLY kill him with absolutely no pain whatsoever. One moment hes alive, the next- dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He literally does not know this. He wont think or feel anything about this. Why is this wrong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for my reason for killing him- there isn&amp;#39;t any but the fact that i wanted to kill him.
