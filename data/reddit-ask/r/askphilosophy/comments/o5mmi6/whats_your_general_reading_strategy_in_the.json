In my academic life, I&#39;ve prided myself on being someone who maybe hasn&#39;t read as much as some of my colleagues have claimed to, but for the things I did read, I read them very well--I think there&#39;s some moment during a Derrida interview where the interviewer points to the expansive bookshelves in his office and asks him, &quot;how many of them have you read?&quot; and he replies in jest, &quot;just these three--but I read them really, really well.&quot; That&#39;s sort of what I mean. I take my time to understand every sentence, I take voluminous notes, and as a result there&#39;s a relatively small number of texts that I am very familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>However, over the course of the writing of my MA thesis, I&#39;ve come up against the limitations of this way of doing things--namely, my very sparse literature review and general lack of serious engagement with secondary sources. I have a lot of (what I think are) profound things to say about the book that is central to my thesis, but it is largely my own reaction to the text with very little engagement with the surrounding scholarship.</p>\n\n<p>Now, for the MA thesis, I was sort of able to get away with this insofar as the particular topic I chose had to do with a topic that was almost entirely neglected in my area, such that there were really only maybe three or four papers that were directly related to what I&#39;m working on.</p>\n\n<p>For the PhD, however, I am jumping over to a totally different area, and this is an area that has arguably been one of the most hotly debated topics in French intellectual life for the last 40 years. As a result, I&#39;m faced with a reading list that, with my reading style, I will never be able to even come close to touching in the span of four years. I&#39;m hopefully beginning my PhD next winter semester, and there&#39;s already over 350 items in my Zotero folder for this project--many of them are short papers, but a significant number of them are long, dense books that would take me, at minimum, a full semester to read through &quot;carefully&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone been faced with a similar issue before, and if so, how did you adapt your reading style to match this new challenge? What&#39;s the best way to intelligently skim a long, dense, complicated book?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
