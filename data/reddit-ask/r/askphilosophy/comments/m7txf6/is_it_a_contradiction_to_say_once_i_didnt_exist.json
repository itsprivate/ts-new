My existence is Kevin, they are together. Before conception there was no Kevin. The laws of logic don&#39;t apply to nonexistent entities, so I can&#39;t say Kevin in the state of non existence = Kevin in the state of non existence , because neither of those things exist. Right? So I was never in the state of non-existence, so saying I once never existed would be a contradiction. Because the I refers to Kevin, and I only existed as Kevin, nothing before, so I can&#39;t say Kevin once didn&#39;t exist because Kevin refers to the one of me, that exists? And it would be different from saying an injured man once wasn&#39;t injured, because you&#39;re referring to the version of them that wasn&#39;t injured. There is no version of me in a state of nonexistence, because that doesn&#39;t exist - I think?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m kind of confused about this, if anyone can help a little let me know.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
