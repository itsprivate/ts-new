My field of work is in military intelligence, and our primary goal is to make overly complex topics simplified for the regular person to understand to make critical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My issue with philosophical writing: Unless you have studied and have a strong grasp on the subtle nuances in philosophical writing, this shit is impossible to understand. For example, in the Second Formulation of the Categorial Imperative, it commonly refers to the phrase, &amp;quot;treating someone as an ends.&amp;quot; I instantly thought; &amp;quot;okay, in what way are you USING that word???&amp;quot; NOWHERE in the writing does it actually break down the usage of the word &amp;quot;ends&amp;quot; in this case. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By making the reader assume an understanding of phrases and words up to their own interpretation in philosophical writing, you lose all clarity to make a decent decision as a result. I apologize if it seems like I&amp;#39;m bashing philosophy, but I wanted to see if anyone else had these issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
