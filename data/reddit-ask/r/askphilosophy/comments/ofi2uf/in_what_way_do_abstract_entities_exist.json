I want to get some clarity and perhaps new ideas.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to mathematics, I&#39;m a very convinced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)\">formalist</a>, believing that all of mathematics is just made up symbols and symbol manipulation rules. In a similar vein, I believe that all categorizations are entirely made up by humans and don&#39;t exist in reality (or more precisely, if they exist in reality, they solely exist within our minds). If there were no minds, there were no mathematics and no categorizations. For instance, the concept of chair-ness doesn&#39;t exist in reality, it merely exists within our minds as a learned predicate taking as input sense data. I think this is a very reasonable position and I don&#39;t even see how one could begin to disagree with this. Is there a name for it?</p>\n\n<p>Where it gets confusing for me is when we talk about physics. Obviously, our physical theories are just as made up as everything I&#39;ve mentioned before, however, there seems to be more to it. They seem to approximate something that actually exists. Belief in the existence of physical reality necessitates some sort of belief in the regularity of this reality. This regularity, which we attempt to capture with our physical theories, does not exist as a component inside the reality but rather as a meta-fact about the nature of this reality. If it is the case that for all particles X and Y within physical reality, they interact such and such with each other, in what sense does this fact exist? To me this fact appears to be independent of minds so it therefore wouldn&#39;t be fair to say that they occupy the same space in ontology as mathematics or categorizations.</p>\n\n<p>If we are forced to admit that there exist not only mental states and/or physical objects, but also e.g. meta-facts about physical reality itself, wouldn&#39;t this point to a more platonic philosophy of mathematics? Also, these facts nevertheless appear to be dependent on physical reality and physical reality is dependent on them too; it&#39;s a weird form of symbiosis where neither one may <em>logically</em> be absent.</p>\n\n<p>This was a whole lot of rambling without too many pointed questions but I hope people can still chime in and maybe give me new ideas or challenge the laid out ones.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
