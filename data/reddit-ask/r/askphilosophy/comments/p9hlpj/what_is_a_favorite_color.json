What meaningful information do I gain from knowing that someone &quot;likes color x more than color y&quot;? Is it even possible to reduce to a single favorite color, with no index to context?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never heard anyone question this notion before. I&#39;ve always just taken its meaning for granted, as have other people, from what I gather. Everyone I&#39;ve ever asked has been able to label a color or a couple of colors as their &quot;favorites&quot;. I&#39;ve always been able to do the same. But upon reflection, I find it difficult to pinpoint exactly what information I gained from their answers.</p>\n\n<p>Other questions relating to preferences provide answers with much clearer and easily tracable meaning. &quot;What is your favorite dish?&quot;, though ostensibly similar to the question of color seems to me to give me a far more meaningful insight into one&#39;s mental state. Perhaps an analogous question for the gustatory sense would be &quot;what is your favorite taste?&quot;. But this question seems much more silly for some reason, which I can only ascribe to the greater intensity, and by extension clarity in communication, of visual over gustatory stimuli.</p>\n\n<p>Is this concept of one&#39;s &quot;favorite color&quot; specific to western culture? I ask because upon reflection, I don&#39;t even know how I would begin to find out what my favorite color is, were the concept not cemented inside my brain as a child. I can easily describe what colors I think I look good in, or what colors I prefer my bathroom&#39;s walls to be. But even the answers to these questions differ from one another. So how can I know what my favorite color is &quot;overall&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr:</p>\n\n<p>(1) What meaning (if any) does one&#39;s &quot;favorite color&quot; convey about their mind and experience?</p>\n\n<p>(2) Why doesn&#39;t an analogous concept appear to exist for any other senses (gustatory, auditory, etc.)?</p>\n\n<p>(3) To what extent is the idea of a &quot;favorite color&quot; cultural?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
