The winners already got the <strong>very special Owl of Minerva award</strong>, wherever possible on the nominated content. The awards include one month free reddit premium which, I guess, gives you a month without ads and another goodie or two. Congratulations! Without further ado, I give you the winners - in the order of votes received for the first two categories, and alphabetically for the last.
