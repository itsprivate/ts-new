I&#39;ve read that it doesn&#39;t provide a lot of clear options as it won&#39;t equip me with job-specific skills, but I&#39;ve also read that it can be an extremely useful degree as it shows a potential employer your ability to engage with big ideas and work through complex problems. I know paired with another degree (ie. something realting to policy creation) it will look really good but I&#39;m not sure I want to do a double major or another degree just to make the philosophy one useful. just looking for other opinions :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
