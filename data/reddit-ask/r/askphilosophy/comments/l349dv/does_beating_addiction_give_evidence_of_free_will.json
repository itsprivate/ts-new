The drug becomes the brains top priority. So why would your subconscious decide to stop using what your neural pathways rely on for pleasure? You could argue that your brain recognizes the harm done to your body, but what about a gambling or sex addiction that has no adverse effect on the body and is purely mental? Why would your subconscious choose to randomly quit? Wouldn’t the person who chooses to go against his brain function have free will?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I know I am most likely wrong and want free will to exist to appease my mind, but the discussion has been very interesting. I love reading everyone’s viewpoints. Thanks for the discussion!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
