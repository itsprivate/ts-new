Language becomes a barrier for the less educated and philosophy becomes an elite of thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t we use common words that the average human being in 2022 can understand? When we try to explain something to a friend we use common words and he understands, but when we are going to write a philosophical book about the same subject we need to use words and build overly complicated sentences? Doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and i don&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
