Everything from early 20th century analytic philosophers to the modern day caricatures that exist (sometimes exclusively) in the minds of those who frequent the dark web.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this? I can understand commitments to left wing views on politicized topics such as climate science or evolution, or other social issues. But why is capitalism so widely despised, particularly among ethicists, who otherwise seem capable of enough radical skepticism to seriously entertain the thought that anything could be moral or immoral? How can we KNOW with enough certainty that a political idea is worth spending effort on?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: If anyone would like to seriously discuss or dismantle my responses rather than trade downvotes, my DMs are open. So far, this post has reinforced a lot of what I already believe, but I don&#39;t want to de-rail from the question.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
