Some meta-studies have put the rate of replicability in certain subdisciplines lower than 50%. But it seems like replicability is a sane epistemological standard, we&#39;re trying to figure out how things truly are, not what just happened to occur in a single experiment. But if the chance of some insight being replicable is lower than a coin toss, why accept anything that initially comes out of that domain at all? </p>\n\n<p>It seems reasonable to reject claims made by experts in that domain by default, and only accept a certain subset that already has been reproduced successfully after some time. But this seems to go strongly against how we treat science, and what we demand of people when we say follow the science. If someone linked an article in <a href=\"/r/science\">/r/science</a> &quot;experts find that...&quot; and I replied &quot;yeah that&#39;s a study in a subfield of psychology with a replicability rate of 35%, I don&#39;t believe this until I see multiple replications&quot;, I&#39;d probably be banned for science denialism. But would I be unreasonable?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
