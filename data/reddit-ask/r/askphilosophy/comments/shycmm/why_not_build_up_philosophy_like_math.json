Figure out what the differing axioms are between the two parties. And If I were to make an argument for i.e. the existence of god or, well, any philosophical argument,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d start with a number of axioms and definitions as you would in a math text book and just go on with theorems and more definitions till I reach the desired goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least to me that appears like the most principled and, from my view, only sound approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;d think if it were done that way, people wouldn&amp;#39;t disagree on basically everything in philosophy (at least that&amp;#39;s the way it seems), yet that&amp;#39;s what appears to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to come up with such a mathematical system, I would probably start with the axiom:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There exist statements, which are self-evident by human experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then define something about certain statements being equal in such and such, basically defining equality, and trying to build arguments by equating a subject of debate to something that is &amp;quot;self-evident&amp;quot; by many steps. Maybe self-evident would require more strict definitions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though what IS self evident is basically just another axiom, at least you&amp;#39;d easily be able to tell where people differ in their world view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is going on here? How is a normal philosophical argument constructed compared to this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why not construct it in this strict, seemingly air-tight, mathematical way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would that not lead to some things being surely proven and believed universally? Why does it appear that no statement is universally accepted in philosophy, but almost all math is?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Philosophy is hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the great responses, though! Very interesting discussions happening here!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
