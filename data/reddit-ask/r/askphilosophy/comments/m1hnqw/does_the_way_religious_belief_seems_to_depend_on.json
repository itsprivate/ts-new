Arabs are almost entirely Muslims. Italians are mostly Catholic. Russians are Orthodox. Americans are Protestant (except ones descended from Ireland, Italy, Mexico, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>You get the point. But also, when you look at influential philosophers you notice the same trends. Aquinas said Islam was false and Catholicism was true. Ibn Sina assured us that Catholicism was false and Islam was true. Eastern philosophers assure us that both are false and some religion local to them is true, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So when looking at the surface level, I just have the feeling if I’m reading Thomas Aquinas that it’s just an Italian dude justifying Italian beliefs. Ibn Sina is just a Persian dude justifying Persian beliefs. If Aquinas was raised in Persia he’s have been telling me how he reasoned that Islam is the true religion. If Ibn Sina was born in Rome he’d be justifying the trinity to us. So I intuitively am skeptical of religious philosophy like this for these reasons. It just seems so untrustworthy and like it must not be too convincing either way if location is ultimately what determines all these people’s beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Is that intuition flawed? If so, what’s wrong with it and who are some philosophers who dealt with the idea that people just adopt religions of their area and almost never even consider others.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
