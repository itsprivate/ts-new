  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a third year student planning to honour in philosophy. I go to school in Canada, if that is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to think I am a capable student. I&amp;#39;m a tutor in ancient phil, logic, epistemology, and I&amp;#39;m a designated note taker for almost all my classes. I was invited by profs to do this work, I imagine because they too think I&amp;#39;m capable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am partial to analytic phil, and I&amp;#39;m especially partial to practical philosophies. I think I&amp;#39;m pretty generous, in that even metaphysics and ontology may hold value, even if only a personal, reflective sense. Phil needs to be useful, helpful, informative, clarifying, etc., otherwise it&amp;#39;s not worth doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have an excellent professor (prof A) that lectures clearly, concisely, and convincingly no matter whom he discusses. He can make anybody look good, convincing. He&amp;#39;s extremely intelligent, and i see him as a force to be reckoned with. He&amp;#39;s by far the most academically involved in the department, publishes papers regularly, and has editions on epistemology and logic with routledge and other esteemed publishers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hates continental philosophy, and continental philosophers. I cannot make clear enough his disdain for his non-analytic colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, continental philosophy is easily the most influential branch of philosophy in the socio-political sphere, and bleeds into sociology, criminology, literature theory, history, political theory, etc. Given it&amp;#39;s force, I figure there must be something to it, and whatever  professor A says must just be an entrenched opinion, probably rooted in some bad experience or his politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This semester, I figured I have to give continental philosophy a shot, and so I&amp;#39;m taking a course on Hegel, as well as an independent study (like a mini-thesis) on Heidegger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate it. I feel stupid. I&amp;#39;m totally lost. The prof teaching me Hegel (prof B) doesn&amp;#39;t help and rather does harm, as he is the antithesis of the afformentioned analytic prof that I&amp;#39;m accustomed too. He&amp;#39;s obscure, covers everything in broad strokes, is the sort of prof that thinks &amp;#39;everyone is Hegelian and they just don&amp;#39;t know it yet.&amp;#39; We started to cover Perception in the Phenomenology and before the class, I had a vague idea of the jist of things. When i left the lecture, I had no semblance of a clue what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heidegger isn&amp;#39;t so bad, and I think he&amp;#39;s clearer than Hegel. Also, working on him independently may help because I don&amp;#39;t have prof B in my ear confusing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as cool as Heidegger is (I genuinely enjoy reading him), I feel both he and Hegel are performing some intellectual masturbation. I mean when Heidegger says Being cannot be the highest genus because the only feature shared by the constitutive entities IS being, it sounds like he&amp;#39;s got a point. There is a problem, because, like in foundationalism, our genii get to a point where they cannot be derived from any higher genus like they ought to be. But when I think about the problem practically, I cannot for the life of me see why Being is a real problem? Sure it&amp;#39;s a vague term, but it&amp;#39;s functional. I don&amp;#39;t see communication breaking down between biologists and chemists and physicists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I want desperately to take continental phil seriously. Tell me why I should, or alternatively if the field is hopeless, why I shouldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
