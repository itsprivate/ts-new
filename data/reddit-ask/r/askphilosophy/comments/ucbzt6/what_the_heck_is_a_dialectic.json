But everytime I try to read philosophy from people like Nietzsche, Hegel, or Marx I can&amp;#39;t actually grasp their meaning. And when I try to find what dialectics are or what Hegelian dialectic or dialectical materialism is I see 100 different explanations that all require 5 paragraphs to approach. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;m probably being dense, but I cannot for the life of me even understand what dialectical thinking is, how it is used, and what it&amp;#39;s purpose is. I&amp;#39;ve seen the Being and Nothing example but that does little to help me because I don&amp;#39;t understand what purpose that thought serves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it just something everyone has their own interpretation and definition of? Is it academically obscure mumbo jumbo with no practical meaning? I seriously have no clue and would very much appreciate your help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again sorry if the question doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense to ask and I betray complete misunderstanding of basic ideas, I really don&amp;#39;t have a mind for this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
