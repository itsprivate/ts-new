How does philosophy respond?  </p>\n\n<p>My gut instinct is a sort of unease. I&#39;m conflicted. Some anxiety, as well. Reflect, on the one hand - the hundreds of millions of working poor suffering from the aftermath of two waves of a global pandemic, fresh new global recession incoming - and on the other hand, a small selection of digital creators who can now sell digital pictures of flowers for $25,000. I&#39;ve read many jubilant claims that this is a revolutionising moment ... but I don&#39;t know what is being revolutionised. Is it not an otherwise revolutionary means of ignoring the ecological impact of crypto? What is it solving? What issues? Or is it an innovative means of ignoring them?   </p>\n\n<p>I suppose a lot of Very Online people feel that this is a turning point in making concrete that which was was abstract in questions of the value of digital labour, especially art, but I don&#39;t know how much of a huge win this is considering how much of modern capitalism is already produced through digital labour. Does this signify anything that might change the ways in which digital labour has been systematically de-valued historically? Is there radical potential for something which is so cripplingly capitalistic? It seems to me, a more complicated yet democratised means of speculation.   </p>\n\n<p>My question is - your opinion on NFTs, and whether you have any philosophical literature which tackles the NFT craze you would like to share? I&#39;m interested in all aspects of the debate, but especially anti-capitalist and post-structural opinions, if there are any yet.   </p>\n\n<p>All the best pangolin,</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
