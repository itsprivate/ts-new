What could be his reasoning then?</p>\n\n<p>Like, you know how there is a _nameless hero_ concept of just doing a good thing nobody will possibly even notice, like picking up a trash can from the road, yet one still does it, feeling himself proud for making the world a tiny bit better. Would a concept of a _nameless villain_ that deliberately, cold-mindedly grabs the trash can from the bin and throws it back on the road, be relatable?</p>\n\n<p>Given the matter, did, for example, Darth Vader consider himself evil?</p>\n\n<p>(I&#39;m trying to make sense of the D&amp;D division of personalities to good/neutral/evil, and this question troubles me, as it&#39;s easy to categorize someone as evil from the outsider&#39;s point of view, but whenever I think how would given character identify himself, I can&#39;t help but assume that (mostly) any villain would consider himself _neutral_, or even _good_, no matter how objectively bad his deeds are)</p>\n\n<p>Joker and Felonious Gru are first guys to come to mind, but they seem more like an exception than an example, as &quot;evil for sake of evil&quot; is kind of their trademark. What I want is a general answer that would prove (or deny) that there _are_ (imaginary or real) villains that do consider themselves evil and are common.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
