I wanted to open my mind to new ideas and be able to articulate those ideas effectively to others. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ive found that as ive exposed myself to all sorts of new and contradicting ideas, I feel unable to hold a position or narrative or approach with any degree of certainty. I also have a hard time making claims or stating what I personally believe to others, because I feel disingenuous or close-minded in doing so, knowing that there are plenty of credible arguments against what i am saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically my dilemma can be summed up in a quote from Mark Twaine: &amp;quot;Education is the pathway from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty.&amp;quot; Maybe it&amp;#39;s like the Dunning-Kruger effect?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else felt this way? How can I use philosophy to express myself confidently in the world, instead of being paralyzed by doubt and indecision?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
