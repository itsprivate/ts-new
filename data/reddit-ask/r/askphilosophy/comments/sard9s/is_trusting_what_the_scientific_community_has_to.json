Would that fall under an appeal to authority? I think it is always better to understand the science and data behind something, but we can&amp;#39;t all be experts in every field. If a Biologist were to argue against biblical creationism and use proof of evolution as evidence, could they also use evidence from geologists and astronomers to prove the world is older than 5000 years even if they don&amp;#39;t entirely understand how they came to that conclusion? Or is that an appeal to authority from saying &amp;quot;the consensus of the geological community is that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old&amp;quot;. Would trusting the results from an instrument without fully understanding how the instrument works, just how to use it be an argument from authority, the authority being the company that made the instrument and the initial inventor?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this question is way off. I may be totally misunderstanding what an appeal to authority is, as philosophy is not my strength. I just figure much of our understanding of the world is based on previous information we may never know fully. In a sense, we are standing on the shoulders of giants. The scientific method delivers results, but textbooks have been rewritten before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
