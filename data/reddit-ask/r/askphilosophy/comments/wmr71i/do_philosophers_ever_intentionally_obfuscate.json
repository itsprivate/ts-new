That being said, I&amp;#39;ve noticed in reading the biographies of some prominent philosophers that it&amp;#39;s not uncommon to find them remarking that nobody ever really understood what they were trying to say. Off the top of my head, I&amp;#39;ve seen this said by Wittgenstein and Derrida, and I know there are many others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I remember taking a class on literary criticism in undergrad where we studied figures like Foucault, Derrida, Stanley Fish, Terry Eagleton, etc. The professor taught the class well in that he didn&amp;#39;t spoon-feed us the content and challenged us to understand it through our own mental effort. That said, this professor clearly identified with these figures, and though I started out disagreeing with them, once what they were saying &amp;quot;clicked&amp;quot; with me I was swayed by their perspective. But now that I look back on it, I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that there was an implied &amp;quot;These guys are tough to understand, but if you&amp;#39;re smart enough, you&amp;#39;ll see things from their point of view&amp;quot; tint to the class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to wonder if obfuscation in philosophical writing serves two purposes in protecting it from criticism. 1) If one&amp;#39;s writing is difficult to penetrate, the philosopher can always just say &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t understand&amp;quot; to critics. And 2) By making it difficult to penetrate it elevates the writing to a place of intellectual superiority where we&amp;#39;re inclined to accept it must be true because it was difficult to understand and thus only a genius could have written it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand the nature of this question is partially speculative and may turn out to be more of a discussion piece than a question with a clear answer, but I&amp;#39;m curious if anyone has any experience with academics acknowledging that this happens in philosophical discourse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
