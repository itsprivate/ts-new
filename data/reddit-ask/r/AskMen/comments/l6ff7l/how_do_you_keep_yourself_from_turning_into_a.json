Like when I was a teenager/in college it seems like I had so much ambition and potential and I legitimately enjoyed helping people and volunteering and going on mission trips and learning new things and shit like that. But then life kicked me in the dick a few times and now I just don&#39;t give a fuck about anyone or anything anymore. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m just an asshole to everybody. I&#39;m still polite and try to be cordial with people or whatever, but all that&#39;s pretty much just a façade. There&#39;s just nothing that I care that much about now and my tolerance for dealing with people&#39;s bullshit has decreased dramatically and I&#39;m not afraid to show it. </p>\n\n<p>On paper of course my life isn&#39;t actually that terrible all things considered. It&#39;s just...idk, unfulfilling? dissatisfiying? Certainly nothing close to what I always imagined or wanted for my future.<br/>\nNow I don&#39;t even know what I want anymore or how to possibly get anywhere else. After constant failure and rejection in pretty much everything I&#39;ve tried, I haven&#39;t accomplished anything worthwhile and just don&#39;t really fucking care anymore 🤷‍♂️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
