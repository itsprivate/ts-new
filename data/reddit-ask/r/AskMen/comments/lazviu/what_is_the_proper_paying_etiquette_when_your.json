I covered the tip when the bill arrived because I have a weird thing about not letting people buy me food because I was taught growing up that it was rude. I am seeing them for a second time next week and we are going to Golden Corral for dinner on the first night. I realized that people don’t generally tip at buffets. Do I let the parents pay for me, or do I try to pay for myself, or do I try to pay for me and my gf? Any help would be awesome and I do realize that I’m overthinking this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
