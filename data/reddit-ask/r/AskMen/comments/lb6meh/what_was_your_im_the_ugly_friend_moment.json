Sobering realisation but atleast I know 4 sure I&#39;m no eye candy. </p>\n\n<p>Anybody got some good jokes I can serve with my ugly?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: It&#39;s been pointed out to me that a strip club might not be the best place to gauge how attractive you are. The girls are making purely business decisions. It&#39;s possible I was projecting my own already existing insecurity on the situation. Still glad I posted it here though. A lot of bros willing to uplift another bro. I think I&#39;ll frequent this community a lot more!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
