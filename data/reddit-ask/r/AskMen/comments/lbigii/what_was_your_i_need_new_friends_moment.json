Was playing flag football and got hit by an elbow, my tooth went through my lip then I hit the ground and blacked out for a second. Came up bleeding profusely and my friends girlfriend brought me to the hospital. The hospital made her leave because of COVID, but my friends who I drove with just dropped my car off and left even after I asked if one of them could stay to drive me home. Thankfully I am fine after stitches and a CT scan on my head, but it’s the principle that matters to me. If one of them had that happen I would have been there the whole night with/waiting for them. Now it has me reflecting how much more I put into the relationships than they do. I guess it’s better to have no friends than shitty ones.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
