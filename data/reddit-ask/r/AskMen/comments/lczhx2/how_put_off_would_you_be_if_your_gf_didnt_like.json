He is being very patient with me but I feel like I’m letting him down and sometimes it literally hurts me when I say I can’t. I do show affection in other ways like ask how his day was, cook and clean for him. We go places and explore things. I know he wants more from me but I don’t know how to get past my brokenness</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
