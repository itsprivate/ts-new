I&amp;#39;m guessing because of the conservation of energy, more of the energy would be released as light or other electromagnetic waves, than a similar explosion on earth, where the energy is also distributed as sound waves, heat conduction, kinetic energy (moving rock / earth), etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is that right? and would there be any other major differences?
