I&amp;#39;m not a expert but I think that hair is basically dead keratin and it can&amp;#39;t and won&amp;#39;t absorb anything. But I could be wrong of course. Vitamin E and Q10 could improve the condition of my scalp skin if applied on the skin surface but that&amp;#39;s probably it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s better for me to continue to take vitamins in form of tablets or should I buy one of these magic shampoos to improve to quality of my hair?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
