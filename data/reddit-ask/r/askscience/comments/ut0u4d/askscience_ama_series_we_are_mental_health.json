I am the Deputy Director of the UM Eisenberg Family Depression Center and I have published nearly 120 peer-reviewed articles on depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia with a focus on the neural correlates of major depression. I created Mood Lifters as a way to help many people worldwide who aren&amp;#39;t receiving sufficient mental health care because I want to provide people in pain, wherever they are and whatever their means, with instant, broad access to effective, evidence-based mental health treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Cecilia Votta&lt;/strong&gt; and I am the co-founder and CSO of Mood Lifters LLC and a postdoctoral fellow at UM. My dissertation was on the Mood Lifters randomized control trial. I develop new content, materials, and programs, oversee the training of new leaders and assure data fidelity. I want to make effective and science based care, like Mood Lifters, more accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;strong&gt;Neema Prakash&lt;/strong&gt; and I am a second-year graduate student in the doctoral program for Clinical Science at UM. As a graduate student, I develop, study, and analyze Mood Lifters in multiple populations. My current research evaluates Mood Lifters in graduate students and young professionals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be here for Mental Health Action Day starting at 11AM ET (15 UT), ask us anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;a href=\"/u/mood-lifters\"&gt;/u/mood-lifters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
