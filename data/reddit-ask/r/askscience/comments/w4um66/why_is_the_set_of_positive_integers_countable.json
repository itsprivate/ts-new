For Cantor&amp;#39;s diagonal argument, if you match up every integer with a real number (btw is it even possible to do so since the size is infinite) and create a new real number by changing a digit from each real number, can&amp;#39;t you do the same thing with integers?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: For irrational numbers or real numbers with infinite digits (ex. 1/3), can&amp;#39;t we reverse their digits over the decimal point and get the same number? Like &amp;quot;0.333...&amp;quot; would correspond to &amp;quot;...333&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Asked this on &lt;a href=\"/r/NoStupidQuestions\"&gt;r/NoStupidQuestions&lt;/a&gt; and was advised to ask it here. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/w4u4ar/why_is_the_set_of_positive_integers_countable/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3\"&gt;Original Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
