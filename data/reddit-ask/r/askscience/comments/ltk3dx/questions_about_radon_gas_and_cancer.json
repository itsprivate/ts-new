It seems to coincide wholly with countries that smoke heavily and nothing else. I base this one the fact that if you look at second chart, which is lung cancer incidence in females, the lung cancer cases in some countries like Russia, where smoking is much more prevalent among men, drop completely. Whereas lung cancer rates in scandinavia, far and away the most radon heavy place on earth, are not high to begin with.</p></li>\n<li><p>Realistically, how worried should I be living in an orange zone, or even a red zone?</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
