Sorry if this question doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense I have no formal scientific education, just interest. So if prions contain no genetic material such as DNA, how can a parent pass down a prion disease? My understanding is each parent gives you a chromosome, chromosomes contain your DNA and your genes, a gene disorder is inherited by a parent. FFI is autosomal so the gene for it is found on a chromosome from the parent, correct? But wouldn&amp;#39;t that make no sense if prions have no DNA? How would they be from a chromosome? \nAgain, sorry if this is nonsense lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
