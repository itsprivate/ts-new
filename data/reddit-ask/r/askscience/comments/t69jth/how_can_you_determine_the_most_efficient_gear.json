When I looked it up I found plenty of graphs that represent the efficiency as a parabola, increasing as RPM increases and torque decreases, then dropping after a &amp;#39;peak&amp;#39; efficiency is reached. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I couldn&amp;#39;t find any explanations of why it takes this shape, or what determines the location of this peak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My understanding was that speed is, well, speed, while torque is the ability of a motor to start moving in the first place. So I thought that the efficiency would continuously increase with speed, until the torque is too low to move the load and the motor stalls, dropping efficiency straight to 0 rather than a gradual decrease. Is there something that I am missing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
