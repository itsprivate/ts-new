  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just got done watching a video about Parting of the Waters in Moran, WY. There is a unique feature here in which a creek running along the continental divide splits and half runs to the Pacific while the other half runs to the Atlantic. The title of the video is &amp;quot;The Creek that Flows to Two Different Oceans&amp;quot; if anyone wants to check it out for more context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it got me thinking: Assuming no evaporation, absorption into the soil, or any other means of exiting the continuous flow, how long would it take a drop of water to flow from that location all the way to the Atlantic Ocean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are overlapping issues like estimating actual path lengths of the creeks and rivers, different flow rates that depend on precipitation and water levels, fluid dynamics, and I&amp;#39;m sure a bunch other stuff I&amp;#39;m not even thinking of. Seems like such a cool multi-disciplinary problem. Is it possible to simplify it enough to get a rough answer? I&amp;#39;d love to hear everyone&amp;#39;s take!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
