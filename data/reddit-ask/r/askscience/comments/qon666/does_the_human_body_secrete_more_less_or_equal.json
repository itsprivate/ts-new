If you were to place the same person in both environments with equal temperature, one with zero humidity and one with 100% humidity would the total volume of secreted sweat be more, less or equal in one environment over the other?</p>\n\n<p>What if we conducted the same test again, but this time rather than equal temperatures, we used the &quot;feels like&quot; temperature index. In the dry environment it would measure 107 degrees, and the humid environment 95 degrees with a relative humidity of 50%, resulting in a feels like temperature of 107 degrees. Which environment would a person produce more sweat in if there is a difference.</p>\n\n<p>This question originated from a discussion with friends about that new movie &quot;dune&quot;. We are debating if a hot humid environment is more or less dangerous over a hot dry environment 🤔.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
