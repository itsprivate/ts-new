However, due to time dilation, masses approaching the event horizon of any black hole would freeze in time to our perspective, thus making it impossible for any black hole to gain mass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even if that is not a problem, most objects approaching a black hole would be slingshotted away simply because space is huge and a black hole is relatively tiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does it work IRL?
