These legacy structures modulate soil fertility, individual plant response, and subsequent large-scale ecosystem patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In recent years, incredible attention has been paid to their use as a soil amendment - converting waste biomass into charcoals, &amp;quot;biochars&amp;quot; - dually capturing carbon and increasing soil fertility in managed ecosystems. Most data synthesis, including my own with Dr. Sean Thomas at Toronto, show on average ~41% increase in biomass responses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publicat\"&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publicat&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, much variation ensues from the applied usage in agricultural and forestry contexts - including negative responses. The mechanisms that drive these detrimental effects are many. Still, research shows that low molecular weight leachates (i.e., acids, phenols, VOCs), Ash, and sometimes metals could be responsible for a mismatch in soil physiochemistry.

An expansion of our work and what is written above follows in the talk. And his recent paper: &lt;a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10\"&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10&lt;/a&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you all think? Any other biochar folks here to help weight in?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
