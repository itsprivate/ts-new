  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve doing some research into non Newtonian fluids specifically dilatant or fluids that appear to be dilatant (have an increase in viscosity when force is applied).  I’m working on a project where I need a fluid that can be be liquid and easily allow a slow moving object to pass through but to provide resistant and to slow down a fast moving object.  My issue is I don’t have a way of holding the liquid in place since any objects passing through a container would cause a leek and all the liquid would spill out.  My idea was if you can have a liquid that’s both a non Newtonian dilatant liquid and a ferrofluid then it could be held by magnets in place.  Is this something that is possible? Or does anyone have any suggestions or book suggestions. I’m not sure where to direct my research.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: after reading some comments.  I’m looking for a sheer thickening non Newtonian fluid specifically and I’m not sure ferrofluid is the correct term to use but I want it to be magnetic so I can hold it in place.  Sorry I’m not super well versed in this topic it’s quite complicated 😅. I also wanted to provide some context I’m attempting to make a target for shooting practice that would use a sheer thickening fluid to slow the bullet but my issue is how to hold the liquid in place in a way where after the first bullet is fired the whole thing won’t simply leak everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
