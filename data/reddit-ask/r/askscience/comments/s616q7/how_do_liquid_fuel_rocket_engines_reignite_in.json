This is for You rocket engineers out here!\nFrom my (very limited) understanding, a big problem with reignition of a liquid-fuel rocket engine in space is the &amp;#39;sloshing&amp;#39; of liquid within the tanks. \nWhen the engines are already fired it causes no issue, since the g-forces during acceleration keep the fuel at the &amp;#39;bottom&amp;#39; of the tank, where the pump is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how is this risk, of the pumps running empty, mitigated during reignition? I can imagine you could give the rocket a &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; with reaction thrusters to force the fuel to the bottom of the tank and then start up the pumps, but I haven&amp;#39;t managed to find any real literature addressing this problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If You know something about this I would be interested to hear Your take on it!\nThank You!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
