I&amp;#39;ve seen people talk about stopping diary then becoming intolerant after doing that for a number of months - but were they always intolerant (had no lactase enzymes) and just never knew it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware that apparently, with enough consumption, even people with no lactase production can metabolise lactose (in limited quantities) as gut bacteria can take over - is this what happens in the above examples where people &amp;#39;lose&amp;#39; their ability to metabolise it? They just didn&amp;#39;t know they had no lactase, and it was gut flora doing the work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask because I&amp;#39;ve been recently suffering with infrequent IBS and I am trying an elimination diet of things that may trigger it for a period of a few months, then slowly reintroduce it and hope that things clear up. However, the possibility that my ability to metabolise lactose might disappear because of that does make me concerned. As far as I&amp;#39;m aware, I have the genes for full lactase persistence. They don&amp;#39;t just get shut off if you stop consuming diary for a while, do they?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
