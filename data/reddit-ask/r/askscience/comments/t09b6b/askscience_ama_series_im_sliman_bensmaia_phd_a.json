As a neuroscientist, my overall scientific goal is to understand how nervous systems give rise to flexible, intelligent behavior. I study this question through the lens of sensory processing: how does the brain process information about our environment to support our behavior? Biomedically, &lt;a href=\"https://bensmaialab.github.io/\"&gt;my lab&amp;#39;s goal&lt;/a&gt; is to use what we learn about natural neural coding to restore the sense of touch to people who have lost it (such as amputees and tetraplegic patients) by building better bionic hands that can interface directly with the brain. I&amp;#39;ll be on at 2 PM CT/3 PM ET/20 UT, AMA!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;a href=\"/u/UChicagoMedicine\"&gt;/u/UChicagoMedicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
