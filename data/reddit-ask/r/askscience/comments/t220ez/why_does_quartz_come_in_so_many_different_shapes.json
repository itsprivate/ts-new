I was puzzled by this, since it seems like there’s only a finite number of ways to arrange one silicon atom and two oxygen atoms. Does quartz then have any unique properties that lend themselves to this incredible variability? I noticed that others minerals (e.g., pyrite) looked the same no matter what context they were in, which is what I’d expect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any insight you can provide!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
