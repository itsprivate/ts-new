My finger looked normal and didn&amp;#39;t hurt, so I removed the small thorn and continued trimming. 30 seconds or so later I raise the same hand up again and noticed I had blood all over the finger, and some had dripped onto my pants. By the time I noticed this it had already stopped bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did the thorn hit a vein or something, and removing it caused the area to bleed so much until it clotted? The area now has a bruise around a half inch in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thorn was incredibly small, and the puncture isn&amp;#39;t even noticeable. It&amp;#39;s really hard for me to believe such a small &amp;quot;injury&amp;quot; could cause so much blood. How could that much blood escape an invisible little puncture in only 30 seconds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m disappointed I didn&amp;#39;t get to witness it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
