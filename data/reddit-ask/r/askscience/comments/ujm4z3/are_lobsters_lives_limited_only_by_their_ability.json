And if this is correct, is it therefore theoretically possible that a lobster could be aided in moulting, and we could just pass this lobster through generations as it just gets bigger and bigger? I severely doubt this is the case, but without having contrary information on lobster biology, I&amp;#39;m just going to have this at the back of my mind&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
