I&amp;#39;m not a native speaker of English, so I wondered if that had perhaps something to do with it - perhaps my mother tongue delimited pink and purple differently than English. But asking some Americans, I found out that actually the jury was split. This got me thinking...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Are some color boundaries fuzzier / more ambiguous than others? For instance, yellow might not be as contentious a color as others, but that is just my impression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- If some color boundaries are fuzzier than others, is that consistent across languages? For instance, is the boundary between green and blue always fuzzy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Are there any biological bases for color definitions, anchored perhaps in color perception and processing?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize that this question straddles many disciplines, so I flaired it with Psychology but it could as well have been linguistic, anthropological etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
