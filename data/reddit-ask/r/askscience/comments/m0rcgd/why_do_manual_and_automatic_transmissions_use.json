Manual transmissions and automatic transmissions are designed very differently, with the latter using planetary gears and torque converter. My question is: why did automatics switch to this completely different gearing mechanism, vs. just automating the shifts in a manual transmission?</p>\n\n<p>I am aware that clutchless and automated manual transmissions exist, but I am not aware of why the conventional automatic transmission design was adopted instead of them. Is this purely historical? (If so, what happened?) If not, what engineering advantages does a conventional automatic offer over an automated manual transmission? (The wikipedia page on automatic and automated manual transmissions did not give me a clear answer.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
