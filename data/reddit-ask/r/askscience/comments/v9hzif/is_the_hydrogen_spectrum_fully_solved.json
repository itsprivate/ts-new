Or are there transitions that happen using a state that shouldn&amp;#39;t exist according to the model? I.e., are all states from the Hydrogen atom in the model?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Do these corrections make a closed formula, or are they had to be done using numerical methods?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
