These anti-bodies stick around and are encoded into immune memory cells. </p>\n\n<p>The third is an mRNA vaccine for a virus. It doesn&#39;t cause trouble or invade cells, because it is actually just a harmless bunch of proteins dressed up in a virus costume. Somehow the immune system recognizes that it is trouble and produces antibodies anyway. How? How does the immune system know what is a novel pathogen that needs destroying and what is harmless?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
