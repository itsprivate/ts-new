He&amp;#39;s really into dinosaurs right now, so I got him a how to draw dinosaurs book and some children&amp;#39;s level books on dinosaurs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After going through everything, he really wants to know what color eyes dinosaurs actually had, because he really likes to make his drawings realistic. I told him that we&amp;#39;re making new discoveries all the time, but we still don&amp;#39;t know some things, and he&amp;#39;s down with that, because his books touched a lot on it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried looking up an answer, but I can only find recent discoveries on the color of their bodies/feathers. It&amp;#39;s suggested that their eye color range would likely be similar to birds. Can anyone give me a more detailed/more accurate answer? Don&amp;#39;t feel the need to skip out on details or bigger words, my son loves all the info he can get! I told him I&amp;#39;d have a good answer for him tomorrow when he wakes up. Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
