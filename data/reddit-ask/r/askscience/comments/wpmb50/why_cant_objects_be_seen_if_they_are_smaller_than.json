So if we have an atom at some position X, and we shoot an infinitely thin beam of visible light (wavelength larger than atom&amp;#39;s size), the light must travel and hit the atom at position X because the light is continuous. It&amp;#39;s not like the lightwave just skips over position X. So the atom should interact with the visible light, somehow. If it were to reflect the visible light back to us, then why can&amp;#39;t we see the atom?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
