We&amp;#39;re a group of scientists who study human genetics, and have expertise in pharmaceuticals, precision medicine, cancer genetics, pharmacogenetics, policy and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year is the 200th anniversary of Gregor Mendel&amp;#39;s birth. Known as the &amp;quot;Father of Human Genetics,&amp;quot; he established fundamental laws of inheritance using pea plants in the 1800s that helped us understand why and how certain traits are passed to offspring. Mendelian traits or disorders are caused by variation in one gene while complex traits and disorders are caused by variation in many genes and, often, environmental factors. Nearly 200 years later, human genetics research continues to build upon this foundation and has led to many discoveries and breakthroughs in the time since. For example, research has helped us understand inheritance, and sometimes treatment, of disorders such as Tay-Sachs, Cystic Fibrosis, and many types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re here to answer your questions about how human genetics research of Mendelian and complex disorders impacts the health of all people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.drake.edu/deltarx/aboutdeltarx/deltarxfacultyboard/pramodmahajan/\"&gt;Pramod Mahajan, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Des Moines, Iowa.

ASHG celebrates through the &lt;a href=\"https://www.ashg.org/dna-day/\"&gt;DNA Day Essay Contest&lt;/a&gt;, which is open to high school students around the world and asks them to write an essay about a topic in human genetics. The 2022 winners will be announced today, April 25 at 12pm U.S. Eastern Time. Check them out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The American Society of Human Genetics was a partner in organizing today&amp;#39;s talk.
