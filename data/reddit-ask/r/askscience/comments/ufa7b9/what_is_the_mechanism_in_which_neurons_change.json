I remember seeing a microscopic picture of a few neurons not very well connected between each other, and in the &amp;#39;after&amp;#39; picture (after learning something), they somehow had grown many projections/branches from their cell bodies, connecting with each other. In other words, what is the mechanism behind, when neurons undo a specific connection (synapse) with a neuron, and &amp;#39;move&amp;#39; it to another neuron? What causes them to &amp;#39;decide&amp;#39; to undo that connection?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, how fast do they move connections and change their shapes (in nanometres per second, for example, or is it more like nanometres per minute)? The speed of which the dendrites and axon terminals move to change connections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
