I know this goes against the intuitive description and reasoning behind animal migrations but I thought I might ask around since I could not find many resources online. Perhaps the arctic terns which migrate towards the Antarctic summer, which is colder than the Arctic one, but they are avoiding winter. Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
