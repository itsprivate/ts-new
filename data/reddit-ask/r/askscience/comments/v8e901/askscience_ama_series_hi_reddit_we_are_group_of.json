  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;\nA year ago, we did an &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m5i6g5/askscience_ama_series_hi_reddit_we_are_group_of/\"&gt;AMA&lt;/a&gt; answering science or technology questions on any topic from Reddit. We had a blast and so we&amp;#39;re back again! So please ask us any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal is simply to advance everyone&amp;#39;s understanding of science, engineering, and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More info / Longer read:&lt;/strong&gt;\nCSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We&amp;#39;re a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social, and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 98)!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today&amp;#39;s global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine &amp;#39;truth&amp;#39; and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren&amp;#39;t able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Reddit... Ask us anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however some of the people standing by to answer comments are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor David Humber&lt;/strong&gt;: Over 30 years&amp;#39; experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager, specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Whyte BEM&lt;/strong&gt;: Technologist and Chartered Engineer with over 10 years&amp;#39; R&amp;amp;D experience and 16 international patents across a wide range of technologies.
