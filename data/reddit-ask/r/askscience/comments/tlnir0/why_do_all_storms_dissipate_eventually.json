Is it because of the fact that the earth has land masses that affect cold/warm and dry/humid air distribution? If so, would the southern latitudes be more conducive to long-lasting, powerful storms as there is less land mass over there? What limits how long a storm can last, how stable a storm system can be, and how powerful it can get?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
