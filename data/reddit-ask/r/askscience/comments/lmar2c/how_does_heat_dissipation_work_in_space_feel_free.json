However, I know that the ISS uses radiators. So the only thing that they can dissipate heat is through radiation, right? How efficient is that? For example, parts of the ISS use Ammonia to circulate heat. If I had X liters of Ammonia flowing evenly through a radiator system of area Y at Z degrees Celsius, how long would it take for the Ammonia to reach temperature T? Feel free to be as technical as you want, I come from a science and math background. In fact, I would even appreciate if someone could provide me with information or equations that I could use to calculate or estimate heat dissipation in space systems.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
