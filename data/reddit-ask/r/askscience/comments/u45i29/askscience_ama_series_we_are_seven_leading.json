  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there! We are a group of scientists specializing in computational neuroscience and machine learning. Specifically, this panel includes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_K%C3%B6rding\"&gt;Konrad Kording&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"/u/Konradkordingupenn\"&gt;/u/Konradkordingupenn&lt;/a&gt;): Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, co-director of the CIFAR Learning in Machines &amp;amp; Brains program, and Neuromatch Academy co-founder. The Kording lab&amp;#39;s research interests include machine learning, causality, and ML/DL neuroscience applications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cnclab/people/\"&gt;Megan Peters&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"/u/meglets\"&gt;/u/meglets&lt;/a&gt;): Assistant Professor at UC Irvine, cooperating researcher at ATR Kyoto, Neuromatch Academy co-founder, and Accesso Academy co-founder. Megan runs the UCI Cognitive &amp;amp; Neural computation lab, whose research interests include perception, machine learning, uncertainty, consciousness, and metacognition, and she is particularly interested in adaptive behavior and learning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/%7Eswl1/\"&gt;Scott Linderman&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"/u/NeuromatchAcademy\"&gt;/u/NeuromatchAcademy&lt;/a&gt;): Assistant Professor at Stanford University, Institute Scholar at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, and part of Neuromatch Academy&amp;#39;s executive committee. Scott&amp;#39;s past work has aimed to discover latent network structure in neural spike train data, distill high-dimensional neural and behavioral time series into underlying latent states, and develop the approximate Bayesian inference algorithms necessary to fit probabilistic models at scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://wyblelab.com/\"&gt;Brad Wyble&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"/u/brad_wyble\"&gt;/u/brad_wyble&lt;/a&gt;): Associate Professor at Penn State University and Neuromatch Academy co-founder. The Wyble lab&amp;#39;s research focuses on visual attention, selective memory, and how these converge during continual learning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://voyteklab.com/members\"&gt;Bradley Voytek&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"/u/bradleyvoytek\"&gt;/u/bradleyvoytek&lt;/a&gt;): Associate Professor at UC San Diego and part of Neuromatch Academy&amp;#39;s executive committee. The Voytek lab initially started out studying neural oscillations, but has since expanded into studying non-oscillatory activity as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ruyuanzhang.github.io/people.html\"&gt;Ru-Yuan Zhang&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"/u/NeuromatchAcademy\"&gt;/u/NeuromatchAcademy&lt;/a&gt;): Associate Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The Zhang laboratory primarily investigates computational visual neuroscience, the intersection of deep learning and human vision, and computational psychiatry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/%7Ecstringer/\"&gt;Carsen Stringer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"/u/computingnature\"&gt;/u/computingnature&lt;/a&gt;): Group Leader at the HHMI Janelia research center and member of Neuromatch Academy&amp;#39;s board of directors. The Stringer Lab&amp;#39;s research focuses on the application of ML tools to visually-evoked and internally-generated activity in the visual cortex of awake mice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond our research, what brings us together is &lt;a href=\"https://academy.neuromatch.io/\"&gt;Neuromatch Academy&lt;/a&gt;, an international non-profit summer school aiming to democratize science education and help make it accessible to all. It is entirely remote, we adjust fees according to financial need, and registration closes on April 20th. If you&amp;#39;d like to learn more about it, you can check out last year&amp;#39;s Comp Neuro course contents &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, last year&amp;#39;s Deep Learning course contents &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content-dl\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, read the paper we wrote about the original NMA &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661321000954\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, read our &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0182-5.pdf?origin=ppub\"&gt;Nature editorial&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(21\"&gt;our Lancet article&lt;/a&gt;00074-0/fulltext).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said -- ask us anything about computational neuroscience, machine learning, ML/DL applications in the bio space, science education, or Neuromatch Academy! See you at 8 AM PST (11 AM ET, 15 UT)!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
