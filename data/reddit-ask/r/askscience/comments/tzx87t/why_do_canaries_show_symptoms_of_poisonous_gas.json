Also birds are smaller than humans so the poison concentration should be fairly similar on a per weight basis. The only way I could see the bird showing symptoms first is if it has a disproportionately increased respiratory and metabolic demands compared to humans, resulting in faster accumulation of poisonous gas or that poisonous gas of equivalent dose is more potent towards canaries than to humans?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
