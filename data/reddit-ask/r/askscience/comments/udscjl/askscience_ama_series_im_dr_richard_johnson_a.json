  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, Reddit. I&amp;#39;m Dr. Richard Johnson, a professor of medicine specializing in renal health and hypertension at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. I&amp;#39;m also an adjunct professor at the University of Florida. I&amp;#39;m board certified in internal medicine, infectious diseases and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more than 20 years, I have investigated the impact of sugar, especially fructose, on the human body and how we process it. I recently wrote &lt;em&gt;Nature Wants Us to be Fat&lt;/em&gt;, a book outlining why evolution has programmed us to overeat on the promise that we will lose weight during lean times. However, it&amp;#39;s no longer feast or famine - it&amp;#39;s just feast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My research reveals that we, as humans, all have a &amp;#39;survival switch&amp;#39; that protects against starvation, but it&amp;#39;s now stuck in the &amp;#39;on&amp;#39; position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to my most recent book, I also authored, &lt;em&gt;The Sugar Fix&lt;/em&gt; (2008) and &lt;em&gt;The Fat Switch&lt;/em&gt; (2012). I&amp;#39;ve had the pleasure of lecturing in more than 40 countries and have been funded by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, with that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why does nature want us to be fat?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What do we have in common with hibernating bears, sperm whales and the world&amp;#39;s fattest bird?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cold months drive animals to gain weight, but how does that impact humans? Is it out of our control?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What triggers fat storage for animals and how can we learn from them to understand the human metabolic condition?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More about me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/CUAnschutz/status/1519061556910170112\"&gt;Proof!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drrichardjohnson.com/\"&gt;My Personal Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/how-nature-compels-us-to-overeat\"&gt;Podcast: Why Nature Compels us to Overeat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;a href=\"/u/rickjohnsonmd\"&gt;/u/rickjohnsonmd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
