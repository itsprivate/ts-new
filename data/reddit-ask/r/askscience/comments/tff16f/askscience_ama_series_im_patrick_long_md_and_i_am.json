We&amp;#39;re here to answer any questions you may have about medical genetics or... anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll start by answering our own question: why adult genetics? Genetic testing is a routine part of the diagnostic workup for many childhood onset disorders including cerebral palsy, developmental delay, movement disorders, etc. Your genes don&amp;#39;t change when you turn 18, but it&amp;#39;s still not standard of care to test adults living with these disorders. In some cases, genetic testing can reveal treatment options, management guidelines, or preventative care, that is very much relevant to adults. Most geneticists in the United States are pediatric focused. Adults who are able to see a geneticist may face long wait lists or be denied testing. We believe that genetic testing should be an accessible choice for those who are interested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;a href=\"/u/SequenceMD\"&gt;/u/SequenceMD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
