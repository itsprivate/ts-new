My teacher&amp;#39;s answer kept coming down &amp;quot;strong acids and bases dissociates more than weak acids and bases&amp;quot; and I kept asking &amp;quot;Why? Why does [random acid] dissociate more than [weaker random acid]? What properties do they differ that allows one acid to be stronger than the other?&amp;quot; . . . and eventually my teacher just said &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; Needless to say I&amp;#39;m unsatisfied, any help please?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
