I suppose a refinement of my question would be, if we know the state of all the neurons (to the best of our current ability to pin down that state) of a live c. elegans at time t=0, how accurately can we model how the system of the worm will evolve up to, I dunno, a second later? Ten seconds? 0.1 seconds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if the answer is, &amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t even know what will happen 0.0001 seconds later&amp;quot;, why is that? And, yes, I also know the answer will be some sort of &amp;quot;it is a high dimensional and immensely sensitive dynamical system and god made PDEs hell to solve&amp;quot; (or whatever the proper formalism is), but I&amp;#39;m curious about what the specific technical obstacles are&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
