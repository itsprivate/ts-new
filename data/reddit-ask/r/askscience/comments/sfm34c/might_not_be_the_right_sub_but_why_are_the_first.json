Why not make them either all Greek or if the scientific community really wanted to differentiate hydrocarbons, all Latin (ok that would actually be worse IMO), like we use Greek roots 1-4 with non-hydrocarbons, and I&amp;#39; pretty sure Greek roots for 11-24, 21-24, etc. are used. Why are meth-, eth-, prop-, and but- the roots for 1-4, what&amp;#39;s the logic behind it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
