  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit! I&amp;#39;m Dr. Yasmin Hurd, the Director of the Addiction Institute within the Mount Sinai Behavioral Health System, and the Ward Coleman Chair of Translational Neuroscience and Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. I&amp;#39;m an internationally renowned neuroscientist whose translational research examines the neurobiology of drug abuse and related psychiatric disorders. My research exploring the neurobiological effects of cannabis and heroin has significantly shaped the field. Using multidisciplinary research approaches, my research has provided unique insights into the impact of developmental cannabis exposure and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the drug&amp;#39;s protracted effects into adulthood and even across generations. My basic science research is complemented by clinical laboratory investigations evaluating the therapeutic potential of novel science-based strategies for the treatment of opioid addiction and related psychiatric disorders. Based on these high-impact accomplishments and my advocacy of drug addiction education and health, I was inducted into the National Academy of Medicine, complementing other honors I have received in the field. Recently, I was featured in the NOVA PBS film &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-dxMTDzMLY\"&gt;The Cannabis Question&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which premiered in September and explores the little-known risks and benefits of cannabis use. I&amp;#39;ll be on at 3 p.m. (ET, 20 UT), ask me anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
