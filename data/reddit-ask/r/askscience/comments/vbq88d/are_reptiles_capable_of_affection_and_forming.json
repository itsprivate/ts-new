I&amp;#39;m very confused by this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: a poster has brought up that we may be confusing “affection,” which only mammals can do, with “imprinting,” which “simpler” brains can manage.

Can one design tests to distinguish one process from the other, on a behavioral, empirical, tangible, objective level?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
