The Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment, or &lt;a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/capstone/\"&gt;CAPSTONE&lt;/a&gt;, is a CubeSat mission launching no earlier than May 31, 2022. For at least six months, the small spacecraft will fly a unique elongated path around the Moon. Its trajectory - known as a near rectilinear halo orbit - has never been flown before! After it&amp;#39;s tried and tested by CAPSTONE, the same orbit will also be home to NASA&amp;#39;s future lunar space station &lt;a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/gateway\"&gt;Gateway&lt;/a&gt;. CAPSTONE&amp;#39;s flight will provide valuable data about this orbit that could support future missions to the Moon and beyond, helping to launch a new era of human space exploration. Commercial partner Rocket Lab will launch CAPSTONE, and small business partner Advanced Space will operate the mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elwood Agasid, NASA CAPSTONE lead at NASA&amp;#39;s Ames Research Center&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Justin Treptow, Small Spacecraft Technology program deputy executive at NASA Headquarters&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ali Guarneros Luna, aerospace and system engineer at NASA&amp;#39;s Ames Research Center&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nujoud Merancy, Exploration Mission Planning Office chief at NASA&amp;#39;s Johnson Space Center&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Michael Thompson, CAPSTONE orbit determination lead at Advanced Space&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alec Forsman, CAPSTONE lead systems engineer at Advanced Space&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ethan Kayser, CAPSTONE mission design lead at Advanced Space&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask us anything about:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What makes CAPSTONE&amp;#39;s orbit unique&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How spacecraft like CAPSTONE help demonstrate and test technologies for future missions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What the CAPSTONE mission timeline looks like&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be online to answer questions on Wednesday, May 18 from 1:00-2:30 pm PT (4:00-5:30 pm ET, 8:00-9:30 pm UTC) and will sign our answers.
