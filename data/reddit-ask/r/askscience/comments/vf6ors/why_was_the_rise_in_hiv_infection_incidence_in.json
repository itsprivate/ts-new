Over the last decade, the only other region with a rise in incidence was Middle East And North Africa, but it was only a 7% increase, vs +43% in Eastern Europe And Central Asia.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2021-global-aids-update_en.pdf\"&gt;https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2021-global-aids-update_en.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gathered from this document by UNAIDS that the major disease burden in this region is on IV drug users, and the main hurdles to controlling the disease are punitive laws and social stigma (p.336, 338). But why is this region handling the disease so much worse than other regions, specifically Middle East And North Africa?           &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that these 2 regions have similarly oppressive political climate and legislature (Table 18.2 &amp;amp; 19.2). The minorities also appears to be similarly marginalized. And according to the document, Eastern Europe And Central Asia had more resources available than Middle East And North Africa did (~40% vs 20% of the resource needed for achieving 2025 goals) (Fig. 18.10 &amp;amp; 19.6).      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that this is probably a complicated issue with a myriad of factors at play. And I must admit that I do not know much about the political and cultural situation of these regions. To sum up, my question is: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are the major impetus to the remarkably worse HIV control in Eastern Europe And Central Asia, as compared to Middle East And North Africa, despite having a seemingly similar socio-political environment and higher resource availability?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
