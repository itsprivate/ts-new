I was basically having a doubt in the physiology of blood pressure and arteries and my professors were unable to completely answer it, but they gave the reason as ’the large elastic arteries do not follow Bernoulli’s principle’. I‘m not satisfied with this explanation but as they are not physics professors they just made me accept it as such. So I’m flairing this as physics, but it could be that they misinterpreted my original question which is kinda complicated. So is it true? And why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
