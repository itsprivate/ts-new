For them, that eye is blind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, time blindness is also believed to be a sensory issue by those who have studied it, but unlike aphantasia, it has yet to be proven scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For people with time blindness, starting to use a timer for daily tasks can feel like putting on a pair of needed glasses for the first time. They need an aid to monitor the passing of time the way others can naturally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was aphantasia a &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot; before the scientific proof was found, and is now a proven sensory deficiency?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does the &amp;quot;timer&amp;quot; part of the brain need to be discovered and a deficiency noted in the time-blind in order for their condition to be validated, or does science accept time perception as a sense like sight or hearing, without physical evidence of the mechanism?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://academic-practice.com/2022/03/16/now-or-not-now-understanding-time-blindness-in-students-%EF%BF%BC/\"&gt;This research university&lt;/a&gt; (University of Dublin) recognizes time blindness and accomodates students with it.
