First, you hear the  sound that comes out of your mouth ( the one that other people hear),  and at the same time you hear that which is coming from vibrations  produced by our vocal chords, which travel through our head. The bones  in our skulls tend to enhance the lower-frequency vibrations, and that&amp;#39;s  why our voice sounds lower to us than it really is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I wasn&amp;#39;t able to find any numbers anywhere. How much lower does our voice actually sound? If I change the frequency or pitch of my recording, could I change the recorded voice to what I hear in my head?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
