Which raises a good point.  If she needs a blood transfusion and we then did a 23 and me type test but with blood (not the saliva test).  What results are we going to get back?  The donors heritage or hers?  Or a bit of both.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whose dna is in that blood?  If she drops some blood at a crime scene and the police swab it for evidence.  Will it match to her dna, will it have both sets of dna?  If it shows as the donors dna in the blood, does it change back to her blood over time?  What about organ donation?  That organ will always have the dna of the donor yes? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if formatting is rubbish - I’m in mobile.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
