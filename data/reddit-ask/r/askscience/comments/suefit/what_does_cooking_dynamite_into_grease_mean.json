What does he mean by &amp;quot;cooked&amp;quot;? Literally, in an oven or on the stove? What is all even in that &amp;quot;grease&amp;quot;? Is it soupy or solidified?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I&amp;#39;m now aware of Nobel having made nitroglycerin safer by inventing dynamite so that&amp;#39;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
