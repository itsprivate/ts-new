Of these, only two types of animals were found to be infected in the wild: mink and white-tailed deer. These findings have serious implications for managing (and ultimately ending) the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about our work to identify, diagnose and treat COVID-19 infections in wildlife. We&amp;#39;ll discuss your questions about animal disease reservoirs, the potential for additional SARS-CoV-2 variants, and what our research (and the work of others) tells us about the role of wildlife in the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are laboratory researchers, veterinarians, and evolutionary biologists.
