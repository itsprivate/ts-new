What is the starting point for a rock’s age? I assume it might vary based on the type of rock, like maybe volcanic rocks are “born” when they emerge from a volcano, or sedimentary rocks are “born” when they harden from whatever swampy material they were before, but I’m not sure, and Googling mainly tells me that Dwayne Johnson was born in 1972, which is interesting but not helpful. Since just about every rock is made of material that has been around since the Big Bang, it’s confusing to know what science considers the start of a rock’s existence. What defines a rock’s birthday?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
