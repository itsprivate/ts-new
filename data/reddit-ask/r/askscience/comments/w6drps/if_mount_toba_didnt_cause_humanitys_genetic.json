From my understanding of the theory itself, a genetic bottleneck that occurred ~75,000 years ago was linked to the Toba VEI-8 eruption. However, evidence showing that societies and cultures away from Southeast Asia continued to develop after the eruption, which has seemed to debunk the Toba Catastrophe Theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, that still doesn&amp;#39;t explain the genetic bottleneck found in humans around this time. So, my question is, are there any theories out there that suggest what may have caused this bottleneck? Or has the bottleneck&amp;#39;s validity itself been brought into question?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
