In a study published last week in Science Advances, our interdisciplinary team of researchers found, to our surprise, that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid produced by the cannabis plant, can prevent replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in human cells in a dish, and that mice who are pre-treated with CBD shower lower rates of infection when exposed to the virus. We also looked at real-world data collected from patients who were taking a medically prescribed CBD solution for the treatment of epilepsy and found that they tested positive for COVID-19 at significantly lower rates than similar patients who were not taking CBD. All together, we feel this provides compelling evidence that CBD could be a prophylactic treatment to prevent COVID-19, or even a treatment that could be used in the early stages of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are now hoping to launch clinical trials on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/researchers-recommend-clinical-trials-for-cbd\"&gt;Read a summary of the research paper here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://benmay.uchicago.edu/faculty/marsha-rosner-phd\"&gt;Marsha Rosner, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is the Charles B.
