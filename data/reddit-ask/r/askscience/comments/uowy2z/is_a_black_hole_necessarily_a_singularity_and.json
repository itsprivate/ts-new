Can you have a singularity so small that light can&amp;#39;t fall into it, or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sort of thinking of this case where you have a neutron star, and you add one neutron at a time... is there going to be a point where I add a neutron and &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s a singularity / black hole, or is there some in-between (however narrow) where you&amp;#39;re not quite one or the other?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
