My question is; when litmus paper is left (away from acid, but exposed) should it stay the same colour? I only ask this as when we tear a piece off the roll a bit of it still sticks out of the container and guaranteed everytime that little bit turns dark red. We have asked our health and safety and one just ignored the question whilst the other said it was just what happens to it when exposed. By it turning red just sat away from acid does that mean ventilation is shit and we&amp;#39;re all just breathing in acid? For example, out of curiosity I took a strip home in the car with me and that&amp;#39;s still the same colour it was yesterday when I took it (orangey, yellow)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
