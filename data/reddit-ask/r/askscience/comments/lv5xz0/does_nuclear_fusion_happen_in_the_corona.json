The equation (3/2)nkT = e<sup>2</sup> /r gives a temperature of ~10<sup>10</sup> K, but taking into account quantum tunneling and using the de Broglie wavelength as the radius of the nucleus, you can get a much lower temperature of ~10<sup>7</sup> K. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s pretty close to the temperatures observed in the corona. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem\">Wikipedia</a> even mentions that the corona is 10<sup>6</sup> K and parts of it can reach even of 10<sup>7</sup> K, though doesn&#39;t have a source attached to it. </p>\n\n<p>So does that mean that there are parts of the corona the can fuse hydrogen? I&#39;m assuming the answer is no, and that you need a relatively high pressure as well for fusion to happen, but pressure doesn&#39;t seem to appear in the equations. Are the calculations above just approximations to get the order of magnitude for the temperature?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
