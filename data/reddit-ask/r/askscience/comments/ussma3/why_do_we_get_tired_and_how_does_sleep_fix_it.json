When we sleep, my body still works. Heart still pumps, brain still thinks, so how does me being unconscious result in energy in the morning? What makes our body energized after sleep and why can&amp;#39;t we do it when we&amp;#39;re awake?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find all kinds of answers online, such as scientists conducting an experiment on dogs. One dog was trained until exhaustion, they then took the blood from his body and transferred it to another dog, which instantly felt tired? So that means tiredness lies in the blood? If so, why would sleep fix that? My heart pumps when I&amp;#39;m awake too, my organs work to filter out the toxins out of my body. There&amp;#39;s also another reason stating that the body cells must regenerate. But why don&amp;#39;t they when we&amp;#39;re awake too? What keeps them from doing so?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t find any specific information on why we&amp;#39;re tired online, only tips on how to be more energized and stuff of that sort, so I&amp;#39;m here. Please take this rock off my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
