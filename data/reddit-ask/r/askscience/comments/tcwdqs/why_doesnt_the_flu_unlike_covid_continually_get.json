As I understand it, this is evolutionarily almost inevitable: if a strain has a mutation that makes it more transmissible, it should generally outcompete less transmissible variants until it becomes dominant (exceptions being 1) if it is substantially more lethal such that it kills people before they can spread it, but this hasn&amp;#39;t been a factor for Covid-19, and 2) if a variant is better able to overcome prior immunity, it may become dominant even if it doesn&amp;#39;t have an inherent transmissibility advantage). This happened with Alpha, then Delta, the Omicron, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The implication seems to be that infectious diseases should have evolutionary pressures almost constantly pushing them towards greater infectiousness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However (to my understanding), the flu hasn&amp;#39;t inevitably gotten more infectious over time. Instead, some seasons will have more infectious strains than others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance, and my apologies if anything or any premise in this question is incorrect!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
