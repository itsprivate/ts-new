We are here to answer any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is simply to advance everyone&#39;s understanding of science, engineering and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More info / Longer read:</strong> CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920.

Today&#39;s global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine &#39;truth&#39; and who to trust.
