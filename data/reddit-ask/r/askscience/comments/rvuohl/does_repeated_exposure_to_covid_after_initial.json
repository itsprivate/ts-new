Is there a cumulative effect that will cause this person to get sicker than they would have without the second exposure? Or does the second exposure not matter as much because they were already infected and having an immune response at the time?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
