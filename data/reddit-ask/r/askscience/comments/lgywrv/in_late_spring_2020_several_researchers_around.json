Some of them pre-date when the first discovery of the virus in China! It seems like these results turn the whole theory of how COVID-19 spread on its head. Has there been any further research to clarify how this is possible? Or that might identify some issue that might have caused these studies to find false positives that predate the pandemic?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
