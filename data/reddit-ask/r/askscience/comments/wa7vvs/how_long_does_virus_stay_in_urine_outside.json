Maybe an hour after, a rat came by and sat right in the puddle for a few seconds before scurrying off again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Curious how long virus (COVID or anything else) stays active in urine once it hits the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: a lot of discussion here about whether it&amp;#39;s possible to transmit viruses through urine - the answer is yes, it&amp;#39;s possible. I&amp;#39;m asking how long it stays active outside of the body, usually on the ground (may be different for different viruses/conditions).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, whether we should all be worried about the rat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See CDC page on CMV for one example: &lt;a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html\"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
