The more things you study/memorize, it actually gets bigger. So if I wanted to learn &quot;How does multiplication work&quot; or &quot;Who are all of the named characters on Game of Thrones,&quot; the hippocampus holds onto that information. </p>\n\n<p>The prefrontal cortex is in charge of short term memory. So let&#39;s assume I already know how multiplication works. And I need to answer the question... </p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;It takes 25 toothpicks to make one Iron Throne replica. It takes 20 more toothpicks to make a second Iron Throne replica that attaches alongside the first one like Legos. And 20 more toothpicks for a third Iron Throne, 20 more for a fourth, on and on. So how many toothpicks will you need to make 21 total Iron Thrones, sandwiched together in a row?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The prefrontal cortex is where I would keep track of the figures that tell me &quot;21 Thrones... the first one has 25 toothpicks... so that&#39;s 25 toothpicks plus 20 more Thrones worth of toothpicks... it goes up by 20 each time... 20 times 20 is 400... that&#39;s 400 + 25. That&#39;s 425 toothpicks.&quot; It&#39;s where I juggle the &quot;live calculations.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>But say someone tells me &quot;Now turn that into a math formula that anyone can use to figure out the amount of toothpicks needed for ANY amount of Iron Toothpick Thrones stuck together.&quot; What part of the brain is able to translate logic like that? </p>\n\n<p>A good formula might be &quot;25 + 20(♥-1)&quot; where &quot;♥&quot; is the number of Thrones I need. But just because I can do math in my head doesn&#39;t mean I know how to take that logic and write it down in formula form.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
