I&amp;#39;ve specifically heard this implicated for the 19th century Krakatoa eruption, where people point to volcanic rock of varying color bands indicating partially mixed magmas that cooled preserving the different rock types. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, these sources don&amp;#39;t mention a mechanism for this. Is there some sort of chemical reaction between the different magmas? Is it a physical reaction relating to different temperature/density/viscosity/gas content/something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What leads two bodies of relatively stable magma to generate immense pressure and explode when mixed together?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
