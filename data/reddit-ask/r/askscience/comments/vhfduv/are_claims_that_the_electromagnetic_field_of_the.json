  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been trying to investigate these New Age claims that say our heart is basically an EMF transmitter but didn&amp;#39;t find any convincing proof that this is actually true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously the heart operates through all sorts of phenomena, electricity being involved as well. Where there is current, there are electromagnetic fields. So it&amp;#39;s obvious that SOME field could be detected if we would have a sensitive enough device.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the problem is their claims seem especially outlandish. The research linked below argues that this EMF can even be detected several feet away, which sounds a bit crazy. If the heart would&amp;#39;ve had such a strong EMF, it would&amp;#39;ve been more common knowledge in our society. I mean, maybe they are kind of right. After all, they aren&amp;#39;t mentioning any concrete values, they just say it&amp;#39;s 100 times stronger than the brain&amp;#39;s field (which I also doubt).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human_fig11_293944391\"&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hearts-magnetic-field-which-is-the-strongest-rhythmic-field-produced-by-the-human_fig11_293944391&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first heard about this claim here: &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410\"&gt;https://youtu.be/ta4w28IlzPE?t=1410&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This man named Joe Dispenza was making a lot of sense up to the timestamp I&amp;#39;ve selected.&lt;br/&gt;\nWhen he said the heart produces something similar to a WiFi signal, 3 meters wide, that&amp;#39;s when my &amp;quot;quack alarm&amp;quot; started going off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your opinion? Is all of this pseudoscience or is there any truth to it?&lt;br/&gt;\nDo you have any research to back up these claims?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
