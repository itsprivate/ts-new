Leaving aside other considerations like ionizability, chemical stability, etc., why does either propulsion system prefer the &amp;quot;opposite&amp;quot; extreme of propellant molecular weight? From what I gather online, ion engines tend towards xenon, while the proposed nuclear thermal rockets in development generally adopt hydrogen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am an engineer myself, so feel free to explain in depth.
