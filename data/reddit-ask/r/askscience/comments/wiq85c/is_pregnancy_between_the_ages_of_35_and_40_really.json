But, I watched this &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ryP0UyO5U\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, from &amp;quot;Adam Ruins Everything&amp;quot;, which provides evidence that the risks of getting pregnant between the ages of 35 and 40 don&amp;#39;t increase as much as warned by the majority of doctors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#39;s the truth about pregnancy after 35?
