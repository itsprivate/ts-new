Here, I lead teams that focus on optimizing the scientific output from the JWST mission, with a particular focus on exoplanet atmospheric characterization, as well as teams focused on developing cutting-edge science for this exciting field of research using both ground and space-based facilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I participated on the team that produced the first images and data for JWST (the Early Release Observations ---- EROs) --- and led the analysis that produced the first exoplanet spectrum (of many to come!) that was shown to the public of the exoplanet WASP-96b. I&amp;#39;m also part of several teams working right now on producing the very first scientific results on exoplanet atmospheres with JWST, which range on exciting new science from highly irradiated, gas giant exoplanets all the way to the very first observations with JWST of the small set of terrestial planets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 star.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was recently featured as one of the experts in NOVA&amp;#39;s documentary film, Ultimate Space Telescope, about the engineering behind the JWST. You can watch it here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF-7eKtzAHM\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF-7eKtzAHM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask me anything about:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are exoplanets? Why are they interesting to study with JWST?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What new frontiers will JWST explore in the field of exoplanet atmospheres?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What can JWST tell us about exoplanets orbiting stars other than the Sun? What can it tell us about our own planet?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are the kind of results we should expect in this first year of JWST observations?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What can we expect for the future?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before joining STScI, I was a Bernoulli Postdoctoral Fellow at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. In 2018, I was selected as the recipient of one of the prestigious IAU-Gruber fellowships by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for my work on the field. I did both my undergrad (2012) and PhD (2017) at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, in Santiago, Chile, where I was born and raised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be on at 3pm ET (19 UT), AMA!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;a href=\"/u/novapbs\"&gt;/u/novapbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
