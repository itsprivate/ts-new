This was in the context of nuclear power testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is 2 folded: 1. It was said on the news that the heat this mini-sun produced was like 10 times hotter than the actual sun. What unholy magical material surrounds this heat that can keep it contained? How?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is it pure science fiction to think that if a mini-sun could be created, a mini black hole could be created too? Would this be the worst thing happening to us?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your answers! Hope I was clear enough, I couldn&amp;#39;t really find the news online&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
