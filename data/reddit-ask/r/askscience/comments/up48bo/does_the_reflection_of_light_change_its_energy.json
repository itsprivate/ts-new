My question here is how is the conservation of energy preserved? Does the wavelength of light increase such that the loss in the energy of the photons corresponds to the increase in kinetic energy of the sail? This is all assuming that the sail is perfectly reflective and the photons are not absorbed to become heat energy, although i’m not sure if that’s a flawed assumption.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
