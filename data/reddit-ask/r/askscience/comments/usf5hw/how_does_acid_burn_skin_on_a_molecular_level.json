Our super awesome biochemist suggested we ask a burn doctor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drug scientists here! We are wondering how exactly acids burn skin. Like why does it hurt? What part is corroded and how? After a quick Google and some discussions on peptide bonds, we’re pretty sure it targets the proteins, but whether that’s just the side chains or it also targets the peptide bond, we’d need to waste a day and some money to figure that out. And still would only get a partial answer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured I’d ask here instead of make my second bonkers request to my PI over the span of a month, considering this is not at all what our lab’s research is on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, is it just the proteins or does it mess with other biomolecules too? I’d think anything that could be protonated  would be affected. But some are more stable to that than others or are harder to protonate in the first place so idk if that would matter? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for answering our question!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
