Is it an exciting time in archaeology/peleontology, or should we expect that the best finds are behind us, with the exception of an occasional big discovery? Is there any way to know?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Related, are there any mathematical models related to this question, similar to how peak oil theories try to predict how much oil can be feasibly reached?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
