I drove past again the next day and all the horses were back in their fields quietly munching grass, and it got me wondering whether they had any memory of the previous day&amp;#39;s events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know that animals are able to remember which plants or other animals are good to eat, and which ones are dangerous, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t call this episodic memory. We also know that many animals can be trained to perform a certain action which they associate with a reward, but I doubt a dog is remembering what happened in training when told to sit - it&amp;#39;s become an instinct. Conversely we know that abused dogs will exhibit fear of humans, of men, or of particular objects because of negative experiences associated with these things, but are the dogs remembering specific times that they were hurt by these things, or is it again just a learned instinct?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we as humans recall a memory, we are to all intents and purposes experiencing a dulled down abbreviated version of the original sensory inputs that created it (although obviously the sensory neurons from the body aren&amp;#39;t involved this time). We know that it&amp;#39;s only a memory, but I&amp;#39;m wondering whether an animal would be able to make this distinction. Perhaps the horses in my introduction would become really confused as to why they were eating grass but at the same time being ridden around, hearing a crowd but at the same time not seeing one, then suddenly seeing a crowd but not hearing any noise, then chewing on grass again but at the same time feeling a bit in their mouths. Do animals possess the intelligence to distinguish memories from live experiences, or is this a reason why they can&amp;#39;t possess episodic memory, because it would mess with their heads too much?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
