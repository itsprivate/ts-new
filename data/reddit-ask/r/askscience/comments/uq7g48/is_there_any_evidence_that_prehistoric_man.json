Her defense included her reasoning that prehistoric man didn’t have face wash, since no cave drawings depict acne, so she doesn’t need to wash her face. \nI know, I know. Ridiculous. I’ve already countered with the fact that they didn’t have pollution in the air, their food didn’t have chemical additives, etc. But was hoping that this community could back me up on the caveman acne front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: thanks guys for all the wonderful input! I really appreciate the responses from so many different perspectives. \nJust wanted to clarify that she doesn’t currently have acne, other than the occasional pimple or zit; and she does have good body hygiene. Her argument is that she doesn’t want to remove all of her natural oils with any harsh (or even gentle) cleansers; she’s very much into natural products. Since she is now a little wearing makeup, I think it’s important that her face be cleaned every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
