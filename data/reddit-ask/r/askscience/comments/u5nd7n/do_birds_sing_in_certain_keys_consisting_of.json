Do they use different tunings? If so is there a standard for certain species, with all the birds using the same? Are there dialects, with different regions of the same species using different tunings and intervals? If so is this genetic variation or a result of the birds imitating other birds or sounds they hear? Have there been instances of birds being influenced by the standard tunings of human music in that region? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for all the questions in a row and sorry if I got any terminology wrong. I&amp;#39;ve played the guitar for many years but honestly have only a very basic understanding of music theory and obviously zero understanding of birds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
