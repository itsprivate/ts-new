Significantly, three of four air samples collected during a bed linen change in one patient&amp;#39;s room were positive (Ct 32-7-35-8). Interpretation: These data demonstrate significant contamination in isolation facilities and potential for aerosolisation of MPXV during specific activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We identified widespread MPXV DNA contamination of the environment in respiratory isolation rooms occupied by infected symptomatic individuals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to parse the implications of this study. 2m (6.5 feet) above the patient sounds like it&amp;#39;s airborne right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t be sending potentially contagious patients to STI clinics like we currently are?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
