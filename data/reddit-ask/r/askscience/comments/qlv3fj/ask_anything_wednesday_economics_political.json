Is something a bit too speculative for a typical <a href=\"/r/AskScience\">/r/AskScience</a> post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for &#39;X&#39; were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Asking Questions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit <a href=\"/r/AskScienceDiscussion\">/r/AskScienceDiscussion</a> , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday!
