  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t get it. How are dads so strong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m 26, basically in my physical prime. I hit the gym 4ish days a week, do plenty of strength training, and jog regularly. I wouldn’t say I’m the next Schwarzenegger, but I definitely take care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad is pushing 60, and while he’s not obese by any means, he’s got a bit of a dad bod. 6’0”, 210ish pounds. I haven’t seen him do a real workout since we went running together once back in 2009. I will say, he’s definitely not a couch potato. He likes to chop wood, putter around his yard, shovel compost and mulch, gardening, etc etc. He was also a roofer back when he was my age.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to anything that requires either cardio (jogging, biking) or a good strength to weight ratio (Pull-ups, jumping), I have him beat. But as far as pure strength goes? The dude is a tank. Arm wrestling is a stomp 10 out of 10 times in his favor. Dude can sling me over his shoulder and carry me like a fair maiden without breaking a sweat. I have no doubt he could out-benchpress me with both arms tied behind his back. It’s not even a competition. His functional strength is insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How??? I understand that he was very physically capable when he was younger, but he seemed to have retained every bit of his youthful strength, and THEN some, despite touching a dumbbell a total of 4 times in his life. His bad back is the only thing stopping him from being Thor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he’s almost SIXTY. Like I get if I was 16 and he was 45 or something, but I’m a grown ass man, and he’s hitting retirement age. I swear, he’s going to have to hit 80 before I can say I’m stronger than my dad, and even then I’m not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a universal experience? I truly don’t get it from a physiological standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
