Recently Robert Pattinson is one of these guys , since I watched the Batman movie I never realised how good looking this guy actually is , before hand I had watched all the twilight movies and I always said he is a good looking but Batman really took that to a whole level and I’ve been following all these fan pages of his , but I just wanted to confirm that this does not make me gay , correct ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
