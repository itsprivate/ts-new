It was funny! Then suddenly they felt stiff. When the sharpie dried up, my pubes got gross and hard. I tried washing them off, but they were too tangled for me to use a paper towel on them without ripping up the towel and getting bits of paper in there. I&amp;#39;ve tried everything, I can&amp;#39;t get the gold off. I even brushed them straight with a hairbrush and tried washing them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can I do? I don&amp;#39;t want itchy stiff tangled pubes, even if they are golden and pretty cool looking. Help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
