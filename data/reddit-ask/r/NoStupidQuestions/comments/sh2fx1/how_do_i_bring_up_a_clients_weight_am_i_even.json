The chairs do have an upper limit, and I&amp;#39;ve googled what that weight looks like on an average height woman. My guess is we have about 6-12 clients who are likely past the limit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With our shampoo chairs, this is a safety issue, because if the chair was ever to break, it would snap with the person&amp;#39;s neck in the shampoo bowl, which could cause massive injury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve looked into upgrading our equipment, but salon chairs for 500-600lbs can cost $5k apiece and take up more room than what we have available. COVID ate up my emergency fund just to keep this place afloat. There&amp;#39;s no way I can shell out enough to buy new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a news story where a spa owner put a weight limit on his pedicure chair because it was broken twice by overweight clients. The backlash was brutal. How can I tell these clients that my equipment literally cannot support them without being called fatphobic or creating a backlash? And if I told people that I couldn&amp;#39;t accommodate them, could this spiral into something larger, like a discrimination issue? I would love to upgrade the chairs, but at the moment, it&amp;#39;s just not an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
