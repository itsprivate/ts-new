He believes no one else has these expectstions - is this true?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to add: my SO thinks this is a unique expectation to me. But do any of you out there share the same expectations?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd edit: would these expectations change if you have toddler&amp;amp;baby at home? He doesn&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s necessary to let me know when he will come home, where he is and who he&amp;#39;s with. I want to clarify that I am not asking about constant updates. But like a check in once or twice in 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
