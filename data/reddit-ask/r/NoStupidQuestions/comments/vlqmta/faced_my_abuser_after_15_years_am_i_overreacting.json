  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So today I just burst into flames.\nMy brother in law abused me sexually when I was 11 to 12 yo. My sister never left him and my family never accused him to the police. \nHe and my sister live in my house with my mom, somehow... for whatever reason my mom allows this and i basically have to see him everyday. Hes a religious fanatic and he thinks Im a bad influence to my niece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today we were watching music videos and he said something that i couldnt hear. i asked him what did he say and he started to raise his voice at me saying that i was judging him without knowing what he said. at the beginning i didnt raise my voice because i was genuinely curious about what he said.\nImportant to say that I do not talk to him only if its necessary.\nSo, my mom got home and I was really heated and I said to her that either he goes or I do. My mom got really defensive and I just felt so sad and angry, got into my room crying like a teenager but i heard him talking shit,  so i went back and started spitting FIRE at him, saying that i would never forgive him and that he was a shit parent and husband. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really was angry and just couldnt control myself, I felt i had so much to say to him and I did.\nMy nephew kind of already hates me for whatever reason and i feel he got ngry at me because i yelled at his dad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so bad about everything because now hes planning to leave, my sister did not back me up, she just stood there like nothing was happening.\nI cant help but wonder if i overreacted and if it was better to just keep my mouth shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt good after yelling at him because the little kid in me wanted to say all i said to him but she was too scared.\nAm i in the wrong for this? I kind of feel like I was :/ i feel really bad about all of this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate it if someone would give me their insight about this. Thank you if you read this far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
