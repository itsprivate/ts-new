I feel like the less attractive people KNOW they’re less attractive, right? Despite that, these objectively less attractive people date people, and usually people on their own… level? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m just wondering… are less attractive people actually attracted to their equally less attractive peers? Or are they just settling? Do they secretly think their partner is ugly? Does their partner secretly think they’re ugly? I gotta know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I am genuinely not trolling, I’ve had this discussion with several people in my life and most of them came back and said “You should ask Reddit” so here I am. No rude answers, please, whether or not we’re conventionally attractive we all have value and deserved to be treated as human beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Typos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
