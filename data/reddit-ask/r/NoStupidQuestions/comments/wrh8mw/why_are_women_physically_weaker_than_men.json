I have always been an extremely scrawny guy, and I have been challenged to arm wrestles in my youth by women who are *way* more fit than me, and it wasn&amp;#39;t even close to an even match. Is it simply testosterone that makes men more powerful? Are we better at &amp;#39;explosive&amp;#39; power, or power in general? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evolutionarily, it would make sense to me that women and men would be more closely balanced in our relative power and our ability to throw a punch. I see no real reason for women to be &amp;#39;dainty&amp;#39;. I get that women (evolutionarily) need to prioritize nutrients in different places, so body weight might not be a totally fair measurement, but it seems that the difference is very drastic. Why is it so drastic?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
