She was having a surgery to have some mast cell tumors removed and during the surgery, her heart stopped, and they couldn&amp;#39;t bring her back. The first thing I did was drive to the vet after I got the call, and ask to see her. They brought me into a room and brought her in on a stretcher, and set her on the ground. I laid with her and cried for maybe 15 minutes and then let them take her back. Was that weird? 3 years later and I feel that was a little wierd but it&amp;#39;s what i wanted to do at the time. Maybe not so much weird, but over dramatic?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
