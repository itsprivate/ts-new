Been together for over two years, watches porn only during the week (normally because we don’t live together and because he can’t see me I can’t see him we have work &amp;amp; school etc, only can do things on the weekends) I get mad but then he brings up the argument of “all the men in my family and cousins and brothers do it and they’re all in relationships” but I don’t know…. I still feel icky and weird about it. I really don’t enjoy it because it’s him…. looking at girls ass and tits and I’m just.. idk. Makes me feel more insecure as well as I’m not good enough and that he rather have that. Thoughts??? Open to having a discussion ! Thanks !&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
