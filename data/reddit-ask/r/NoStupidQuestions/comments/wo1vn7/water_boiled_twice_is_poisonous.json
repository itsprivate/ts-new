In the mornings, I like to make coffee using a press (aka French press). This process involves using hot water from the water kettle. My water kettle hold 1.75 L of water and the press holds about 1 L, a little less because of the volume of the ground coffee. Sometimes, I will drink all of the coffee and make another round reheating the same water in the kettle from the first time. My MIL noticed me reheating the water and completely freaked out! She said it’s poisonous and I will become very sick and die. Mind you, this woman is loaded with wives tales and superstitions, but that’s for another Reddit feed. I have never before heard of water becoming poisonous if boiled twice. I’ve only heard “boil for safety.” Where does this thinking come from? Do the bacteria, viruses and toxins come back to life from the dead like Frankenstein’s Monster?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
