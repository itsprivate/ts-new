We do not have kids yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He says that if our kids never want to make their beds, or back talk or something, he wants them to make their beds the army way, like basically have the beds made to the standard that he had to make his bed in army basic training. This would be his way of punishing them for not making their beds. I guess he would take on drill sergeant mode or something like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is not a good parenting style because our kids will just see my husband’s ego of how he was in the army. It also just seems a bit too strict to me, but I could be wrong though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he would use this method all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Is this a good way to discipline kids?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: He says he wouldn’t yell at them or flip their beds. He would just want their beds held to a higher standard. I can’t explain that well, but basically he would want their beds made perfectly like in the army, without the yelling or bed flipping.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
