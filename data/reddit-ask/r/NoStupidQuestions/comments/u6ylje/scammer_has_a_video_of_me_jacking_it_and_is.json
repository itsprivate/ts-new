They are understanding. \nHe didn’t follow trough. As i deleted my instagram.\nI’m convinced he’s an indian scammer, as he called me a while later agressivly telling me to send him money or he would upload the ”jerk off scandal video”. \nHe told me to send money to western union bank and I got some contact info, i’ll be sending this including all the screenshots and yes, the video of me jacking it to the police. And I’ll see what happends.\nThank all of you for the advice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
