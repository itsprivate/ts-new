I came from a very religious and homophobic family but thankfully I got out. I’m not religious anymore so when people tell me that it’s bad to be gay because it’s a sin, it doesn’t affect me much. Yet I still feel a lot of guilt and shame because of my desires. </p>\n\n<p>Is it really okay for me to be gay? My parents taught me that homosexuality is akin to pedophilia and incest. I’m not quite sure I see how, but I don’t want to be a bad person. </p>\n\n<p>It’s embarrassing for me to say this but I think my only desire in life is to live with another guy in our own house in nature away from everyone else and the only other ones there will be our seventeen cats. And maybe some chickens or something.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks for everyone’s responses. I’m surprised by the amount of people who are supportive of me, I kind of expected it to be more split? Maybe that’s because most people on this subreddit are supportive so it’s biased but regardless— thank you, you guys are very kind. I guess I’m going to uhhhhhh just. be gay now. I don’t know how to “start” so I think for now I will just continue to stay single and daydream about being in a relationship with a guy all day every day. Maybe one day when I’m 80 I will hold a guys hand or something. Also FUCK everyone who commented who was unsupportive of my seventeen-cat-few-chickens situation, I think I will adopt eighteen instead now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
