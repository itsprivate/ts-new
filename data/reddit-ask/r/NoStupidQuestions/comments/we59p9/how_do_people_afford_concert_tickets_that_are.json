Problem is, the tickets are $950 or more per person, and she wants the floor, not the back stands. I will try and attempt this, even if Im in a bit of debt, she has been after this forever, and I genuinely want to do this for her. Is there any way I can get some ease for my financial status? I am not necessarily struggling, but I can&amp;#39;t afford to pay this if things don&amp;#39;t happen as planned. I can&amp;#39;t risk it.
