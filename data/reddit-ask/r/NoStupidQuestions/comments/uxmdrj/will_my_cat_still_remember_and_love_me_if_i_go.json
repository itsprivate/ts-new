  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to go away for work for a week soon. We have two cats but one in particular is my snuggle buddy. Every morning and every night he comes to get snuggles with me, bring his toys to me, follows me most places, usually comes and meows at me for attention - he especially likes to play fetch and curl in my arms when I&amp;#39;m trying to work. I&amp;#39;ve been away only for one or two nights at a time before, and my partner says he will walk about the house all night when I&amp;#39;m away moving his toys around and meowing, clearly looking or pining for me. I&amp;#39;ve never had cats before these two and I love him so much. I feel sad that I won&amp;#39;t see him for a week or get my snuggles, but I&amp;#39;m also worried what will happen when I get back. Will he think I left him and be more distant or not love me as much? It would really be devastating to know I did that, he&amp;#39;s my best little buddy. He is coming up on 2 years old if that matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
