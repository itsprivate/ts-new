Every morning and every night he comes to get snuggles with me, bring his toys to me, follows me most places, usually comes and meows at me for attention - he especially likes to play fetch and curl in my arms when I&amp;#39;m trying to work. I&amp;#39;ve been away only for one or two nights at a time before, and my partner says he will walk about the house all night when I&amp;#39;m away moving his toys around and meowing, clearly looking or pining for me. I&amp;#39;ve never had cats before these two and I love him so much. I feel sad that I won&amp;#39;t see him for a week or get my snuggles, but I&amp;#39;m also worried what will happen when I get back. Will he think I left him and be more distant or not love me as much? It would really be devastating to know I did that, he&amp;#39;s my best little buddy. He is coming up on 2 years old if that matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
