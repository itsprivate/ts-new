I’m (19M) currently at my house with my mother. Whole family is here including her mother, two sisters, and eldest brother’s family. We live in a SEA country so it’s usual to have everyone who’s close to be here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother is currently fighting against cancer and as much as I hate to admit it, she’s losing. She has been on oxygen tanks since 6 January although in February she was admitted to a hospital where after 11 days, was discharged because we, including her doctor, all agreed further operations would just exhaust her more. She also insisted being home with us. She wants to rest. I am okay with that too because that means she no longer has to suffer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is, am I a bad son if I don’t or I am resistant to seeing her or being with her in her room for too long? I always want to throw up and I can feel my anxiety building up. Yesterday her heart rate went down to 40 from a month of stable 120 and then back up again while she visibly catches her breath, and that pretty much has a place in my memories forever. I don’t know, what can I do to overcome this fear? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have prepared for this because I knew I have to face her death eventually but clearly I underestimated that. I 50/50 want and don’t want to be beside her when she passes but I think I would have a hard time catching my breath and I probably want to avoid possible trauma (I get chills every time I hear the fucking oximeter beep) if I am with her. On the other hand, I know I’ll regret it if I am not beside her. I don’t know what to do. I guess I want the first option, but how do I not become a pussy and be strong for her right now in order to be with her? Also, she’s back to her normal but weak state now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m still restabilising from this so I’m sorry for any weird structures of my sentences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
