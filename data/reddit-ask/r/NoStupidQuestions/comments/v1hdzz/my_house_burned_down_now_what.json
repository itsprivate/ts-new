I suspect it was because of a small space heater that was mistakenly left on. I rent, so I’ve been in touch with my landlord and am awaiting further communication from her, but I didn’t have renters insurance so I have no coverage. Everything I own is gone, including my car keys. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are my next steps? My aunt told me I can stay with her a few cities over, but that would require me to quit my job (as I have no car at the moment). Is there a charitable organization that can help with living arrangements until I can figure things out? I don’t have a substantial amount in savings, as I’m in college and most of my money goes towards tuition. Any advise is GREATLY appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
