Seemed pretty normal to me, since I reuse my towels about 2-3 times before washing them. But the comments were full of people being like &amp;quot;Wait people don&amp;#39;t wash their towels every time after they shower??&amp;quot; They all thought it was super dirty and weird to reuse old towels. I think it&amp;#39;s super weird that they have to constantly have towels in the washing machine or own at least 7 of them in order to shower every day. Seems super wasteful to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case, this whole thing has made me doubt whether I&amp;#39;m using my towels correctly. What do you think, Reddit? Am I weird for not washing them every day?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
