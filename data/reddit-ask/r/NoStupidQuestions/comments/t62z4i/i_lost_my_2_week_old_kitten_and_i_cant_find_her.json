I came back about 20 minutes later and she was nowhere to be found. I’ve looked all around my room numerous times but I just can’t seem to find her and I’m starting to get nervous, especially since she’s usually very vocal and I haven’t heard a thing. I’m thinking my other cat (her mother) may have gotten out of the room when I left the door cracked and moved to her another spot but I highly doubt that seeing as 1.) the mother cat seems to be comfortable in the room they’re in and b.) I’ve already looked in the one spot I know she would take her and she isn’t there. I also don’t think she would have moved her considering she has another kitten who is still in the room. Does anyone have any idea of where a 2-week old kitten who can’t jump could possibly be hiding?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: After an hour or so of searching for her, I walked into my room and found her literally 5 minutes after posting this. Nonetheless, thank you for the replies!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
