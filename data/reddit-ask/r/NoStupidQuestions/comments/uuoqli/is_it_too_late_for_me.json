I feel like a prisoner and I&amp;#39;m at a loss for what to do with myself. I don&amp;#39;t know if this is my brain trying to make excuses for not trying anymore, on the outside I&amp;#39;m a nurse who loves his job and takes amazing care of patients and it seems like I have a good head on my shoulders but when I come home it&amp;#39;s gone and I don&amp;#39;t take care of myself between mental illness and just pure feeling hopeless. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore I tried small changes and big changes and after a month I&amp;#39;m back to square one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
