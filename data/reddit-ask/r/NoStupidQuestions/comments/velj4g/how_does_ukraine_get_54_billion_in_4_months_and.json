I&amp;#39;m not big on the woke Twitter stuff, but I did see one decent point I can&amp;#39;t get out of my head; how did this get approved and sent so fast without a fuss, compared to the countless domestic expenses we have here at home (infrastructure, student loans, healthcare, hunger, shortages, and so on)? The &amp;quot;how will we pay for it&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;taxes won&amp;#39;t cover it&amp;quot; sentiment you often see when those issues get discussed didn&amp;#39;t seem to come up at all here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(To be clear, I&amp;#39;m not saying I disapprove of the money spent. I just wonder how it got approved so fast and without a hassle when we have all these other issues at home the government drags its feet on.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
