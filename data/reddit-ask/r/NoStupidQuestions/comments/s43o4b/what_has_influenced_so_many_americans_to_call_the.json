Yet the Confederacy, which fell 157 years ago, still has millions of Americans - some whose ancestors weren&amp;#39;t even living in Confederate states during the small time it existed, vehemently claim that the CSA is their &amp;quot;heritage&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What caused this mass amount of Americans living in the ex-Confederate states, and even some living in non-Confederate states, to claim that the Confederacy is their &amp;quot;true heritage&amp;quot; and that the USA which has long both predated and outlived the CSA is not their &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; home country? And why has this obsession with a country that barely existed for 4 years been concentrated to the US, and never occurred in other countries with short-lived fascist governments?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
