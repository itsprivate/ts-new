That once you’re married life sucks, you’re not happy and you’re miserable. If this stereotype has been around so long why do people even BOTHER marrying? Just be happy being single or in a non-marriage relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do people put themselves in these shit situations? And since for decades and decades people complain about marriage, why do we continue to encourage it? Why not all collectively agree that marriages suck and to tell the younger generations not to do it. That’s all I’ve ever heard over the years … more from older people that marriages are terrible. But then I see a lot of “people aren’t getting married these days. Hmphhhh!!!!” But you’re the ones who told us that marriages suck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
