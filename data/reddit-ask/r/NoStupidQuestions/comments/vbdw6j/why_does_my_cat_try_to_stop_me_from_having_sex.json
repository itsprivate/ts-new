Which is already weird enough as is, but I know a lot of cats already do that. But my cat will sometimes try to intervene by getting on the bed, pawing at my head, meowing, etc. She doesn&amp;#39;t try to stop it every time, but she has done this at least once with every sexual partner I&amp;#39;ve had.  Is she upset that we&amp;#39;re having sex?? Am I traumatizing my cat??? I tried googling this but there weren&amp;#39;t many answers, please help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I got a good laugh out of some of these answers ! She definitely has some separation anxiety, and kicking her out of the room usually results in her screaming and scratching. I never thought about the fact that she might be trying to protect me lol, thanks yall&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
