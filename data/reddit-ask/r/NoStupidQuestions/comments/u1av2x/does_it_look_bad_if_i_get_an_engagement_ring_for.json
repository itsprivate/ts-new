But I&amp;#39;ve heard the jewellery industry scams people by trying to say the ring should cost atleast 3 months salary of the guy? I find it preposterous, especially when I&amp;#39;m a big old saver (she does respect that) as I want to have a nice house and plenty of savings for peace of mind. I don&amp;#39;t do bad, I&amp;#39;m an engineer, but can&amp;#39;t fathom spending 5 figures on a stone which she is unlikely to wear a lot especially after the wedding. \nWe&amp;#39;re of Indian origin but in the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
