For example, if you told her to string the beans, she would literally take some string and string them up like she was putting clothes out to dry. If you told her to mop every inch of the house, she would do just that. She would mop the floors, the ceiling, the roof, the couch, the stove, the bed etc. At the end of the story, the people she was doing these tasks for would be pissed at her but then she would hand them a tasty pie and all of her wrong doings would be forgotten. Who was that lady?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
