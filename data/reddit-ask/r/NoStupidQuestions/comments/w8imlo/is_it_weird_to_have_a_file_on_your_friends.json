I forgot all about it and texted her asking her to hang out (while she was out of state). She seemed kind of annoyed and thought that I wasn’t really paying attention to what she told me before - that really isn’t the case, I just have ADHD and really shitty memory retention. and this happens a lot more than I’d like to admit, and it’s starting to frustrate me and it is just really annoying. so, is it weird if I did have a running notepad of everything my friends do or have planned? I feel like it is weird, but it’s also cool to have all the stuff your friend told you written down so you don’t forget it at a later time. Plus, I mean I can ask them about another thing in the “file” somewhere down the line to show that i really do care&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
