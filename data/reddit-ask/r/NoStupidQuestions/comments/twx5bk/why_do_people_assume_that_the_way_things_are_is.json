  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This constantly frustrates me. People all over seem to think that the only way things can be is the way they are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was talking to one of my coworkers about cars. He literally cannot imagine a world without cars. We lived for millennia without cars and now he can&amp;#39;t imagine what life would be like without them. I pointed out that a high speed rail network and robust public transportation could easily have replaced cars. Or if we didn&amp;#39;t rely on items from far away and sourced everything locally. And that&amp;#39;s just two examples of the top of my head and he just doesn&amp;#39;t get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a friend doesn&amp;#39;t understand that private property is a modern concept and doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the way it is. I was complaining that people buy up all this beautiful land and lock us out of it and they just don&amp;#39;t get it. &amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s their property&amp;quot;. So what? We all agreed to the current rules at one point so let&amp;#39;s all just change our minds. There&amp;#39;s no reason private property means nobody else can use your land. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or another time I suggested that we all refuse to come back to the office and just stay working at home. What would they even do about it? But no, I was just laughed at and dismissed. Do these people not realize that middle managers are not the almighty god on high? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Religion is another thing. Christian friends can&amp;#39;t imagine any other religion being good. Same for a Buddhist friend. Some atheist friends can&amp;#39;t imagine any religion at all being good for anyone. Can these people really not think of a single situation where the other thing can be good too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend&amp;#39;s brother was killed by a drunk driver. She 100% blames the individual and doesn&amp;#39;t seem to care that our society is set up to encourage drunk driving. Alcohol companies constantly advertise their drug, bars are open late at night but liquor stores are not, police get tons of money from drunk drivers. But she doesn&amp;#39;t see any of that, she&amp;#39;s committed to this idea that all of that is perfectly normal and the only problem is the individual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get so frustrated I feel like an alien sometimes. People everywhere just want to follow these stupid unwritten rules and never question why they are doing it. Why the hell is that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: People keep posting their views on private property and drunk driving. I&amp;#39;m not arguing for or against anything in this thread. I&amp;#39;m using these as specific examples in my personal life where people didn&amp;#39;t understand how things could be different and didn&amp;#39;t want to question anything. Don&amp;#39;t bother trying to argue these points here because the examples I&amp;#39;m giving aren&amp;#39;t even valid arguments in the first place. They&amp;#39;re just meant as examples to my main point, replace them with anything else you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
