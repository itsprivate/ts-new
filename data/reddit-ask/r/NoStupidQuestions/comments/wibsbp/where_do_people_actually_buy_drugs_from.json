So how the hell does everyone actually find drugs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you for answering.  It genuinely never dawned on me that it&amp;#39;s a networking thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2:  to the people messaging me, I do not want drugs.  I had addicts in the family, but because I was such an introverted nerd, I just never came across this stuff growing up.  I got to thinking about it last night when I was picking up Gavascon online.  I&amp;#39;m still just an introverted nerd and was curious.  Also, I&amp;#39;m old.  I&amp;#39;m not 20 anymore, all my friends have kids.  Never dawned on me to just ask them if they knew anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
