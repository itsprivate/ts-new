Any tips?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thx for al the replies, overall my friends are great, and for some context it&amp;#39;s mostly the girls that &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; me. But at partys it&amp;#39;s always the guys checking if I&amp;#39;m gay (straight guys)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
