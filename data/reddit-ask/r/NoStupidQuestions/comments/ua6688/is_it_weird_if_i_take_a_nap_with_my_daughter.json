I sometimes come home from work pretty tired, and if my daughter is in our bed sleeping i usually just lie in bed with her. Some relatives of my girlfriend told me that is weird, that dads shouldnt sleep with their daughters. I think its pretty fucked up that they think that way..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a friend that has an 8 y o daughter, and once told me that one of the best feelings is when his daughter comes in the middle of the night and hugs him or his wife and sleep with them. Is really that bad or weird? Those questionings sometimes make me question if im being a good dad or if maybe im wrong and i should put more distance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worst part of being a dad is being questioned for every little thing, even if you&amp;#39;re doing things with every little piece of love you can give.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for my english. And thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
