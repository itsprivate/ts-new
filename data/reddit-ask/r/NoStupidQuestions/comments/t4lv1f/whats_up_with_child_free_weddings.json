Part of living in a society is occasionally being annoyed by kids running around or whatever, and if a baby starts to cry, I feel like it&amp;#39;s pretty universally accepted that the parents will take the baby out of the room to calm it down. Am I the crazy one here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
