Apparently my insurance (which is shitty because I can&amp;#39;t afford better) is not in network with the hospital. I didn&amp;#39;t even know that was a thing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m literally living paycheck to paycheck and will never be able to afford this. I think I might have to sell my car, but it&amp;#39;s only worth half that. I don&amp;#39;t have anything else I can sell except maybe my $300 laptop. What do I do? Am I gonna be homeless?? I shouldn&amp;#39;t have gone to the hospital and just toughed it out. I&amp;#39;m such an idiot!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
