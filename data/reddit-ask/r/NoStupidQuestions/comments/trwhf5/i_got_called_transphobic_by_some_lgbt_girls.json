While they were arguing with me and calling me especially transphobic, I said, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know she was a trans woman&amp;quot; and damn they really got mad becausethey told me that I should&amp;#39;ve said just &amp;quot;woman&amp;quot;, I suppose it was my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;btw I didn&amp;#39;t notice she was a woman with male genitalia because I was very drunk. (I just don&amp;#39;t know what term to use right now)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so am I really transphobic? cuz I&amp;#39;m not attracted to male genitalia at all, also is this the right place to ask?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;English is my second language so apologies for my crappy redaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: thanks a lot guys, I feel way better now, I really felt like crap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
