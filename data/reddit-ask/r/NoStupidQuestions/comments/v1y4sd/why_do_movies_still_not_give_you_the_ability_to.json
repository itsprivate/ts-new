Or, people are talking, but the music is so fucking loud you can&amp;#39;t hear them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you just don&amp;#39;t like music and want it lower, maybe you really enjoy the ambiance and voices so you want those higher..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this still not a feature in movies and tv shows?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They came out with &amp;quot;Blu-ray&amp;quot; and honestly I got no fucking idea what that is still to this day.
