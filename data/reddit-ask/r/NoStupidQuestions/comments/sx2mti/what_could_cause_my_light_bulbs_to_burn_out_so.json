  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently (last year) bought a house, and I&amp;#39;ve noticed my light bulbs burn out super fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I moved in, maybe 70% of the bulbs were out. We got them all sorted eventually but I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been changing them about once every 3 months. I&amp;#39;m referring to every light in my house- ceiling fans, fixed light fixtures, even the light inside my dryer went out. It&amp;#39;s been a little nuts. I&amp;#39;ve checked that all of the bulbs are rated at or below recommended wattage so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s that either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought the nicer &amp;quot;eco&amp;quot; bulbs rated to last 10 years, I bought LEDs, I tried regular incandescent... they all seem to burn out super fast. By contrast, I lived in my previous apartment for 3 years and only ever replaced 2 or 3 light bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I nuts? Is this a sign of a bigger problem?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also had an issue where the dryer stopped working completely the day the light went out, but now it randomly works again (with no light) and has been fine for months. When I called the electrician out, he shrugged at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
