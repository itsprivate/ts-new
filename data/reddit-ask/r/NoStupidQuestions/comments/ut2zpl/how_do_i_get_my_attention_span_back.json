If I didn&amp;#39;t have my phone, I would switch between videos rapidly every 2-3 minutes. There are so many things I&amp;#39;m interested in watching, but suddenly everything seems to get boring very quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I &amp;#39;hack&amp;#39; my brain to restore my attention span?
