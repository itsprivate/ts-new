It will cover 100% of costs Food from cafeteria, books, tuition, housing, and provide a weekly $250 allowance. It will cover for Certifications, associates, bachelors, and masters degrees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he says he does not want to rely on me and would rather pay for it through student loans since with my income he does no qualify for financial assistance. It’s my understanding even though I won’t claim him that due to his age he has to claim my income. Idk the financial aid department explained it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how can I convince him he is being completely fucking retarded since I know first hand the burden of student loans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice Reddit ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
