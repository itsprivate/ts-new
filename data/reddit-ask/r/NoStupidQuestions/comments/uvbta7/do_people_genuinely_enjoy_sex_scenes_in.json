Pretty much what happened in the Halo TV show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t find them sexy, engaging, hot, or whatever. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter whether I&amp;#39;m with family or watching alone; whenever these scenes start, I either skip over them or look forward to when they stop.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This worries me about all the American show-adaptation, where I&amp;#39;m scared they&amp;#39;ll Game-Of-Throne-ify the Lord of the Rings show....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
