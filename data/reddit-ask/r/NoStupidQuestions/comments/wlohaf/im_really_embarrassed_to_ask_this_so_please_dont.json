I went to christian special needs school because my disabilities and CPTSD didn&amp;#39;t allow to function in public school my city school district paid for the private school I attended and my experience there is kindly irrelevant to my question. Sex education wasn&amp;#39;t allowed because of faith elements of the School and not because the students were unable to handle it. This isn&amp;#39;t a criticism of Christianity just me stating my experience at a particular christian orginzation . Where do I get this kind of education post high school?  I think it&amp;#39;s important to know for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
