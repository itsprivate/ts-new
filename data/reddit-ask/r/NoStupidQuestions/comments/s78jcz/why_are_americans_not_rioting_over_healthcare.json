  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the rest of the developed world, and some of the undeveloped world, universal healthcare is standard for everyone. Whether it&amp;#39;s affordable or totally free, healthcare is something everyone has access to in 1st World Countries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the US I see absolutely insane prices for basic things people need to stay alive, the prime example is insulin. Insulin in the US costs anything above $100 per vial. In Ireland, it costs roughly €0. My little brother has diabetes and we are entitled to free insulin. We have a stockpile of insulin in our house that&amp;#39;s always readily available and is topped up every month. To put it extremely bluntly, if my brother lived in America he would be long dead by now.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How are Americans not angry about this? In Europe, any sort of cuts to the welfare state sparks fury and is a death sentence to any political career, the anger never boils over into violence because the politicians don&amp;#39;t win the next election. In the US, you elect the same politicians every year with a different label. One side pretends to care while the other openly doesn&amp;#39;t care. How are you content with this? Why do you not have the same level of anger as Europeans would have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just saw a reddit post where someone had to pay $4000 a week for an injection of some kind. Monthly rent in Dublin is lower than that and we have some of the worst housing prices in Europe. It is just impossible for me to even understand why Americans aren&amp;#39;t tearing down government buildings over this and are instead complaining over who won the election, the people who don&amp;#39;t care or the people who pretend they care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
