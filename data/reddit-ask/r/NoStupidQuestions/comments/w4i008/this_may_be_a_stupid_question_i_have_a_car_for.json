Obviously I know how to look at the little meter on my dash that says if it&amp;#39;s closer to empty or full, but I mean how can I get an exact number? I ask because my car takes 12 gallons and I kind of want to fill the tank with exactly 12 gallons, but don&amp;#39;t want to accidentally go over capacity and have gasoline dripping out from everywhere, leaking, making a mess all over the gas station and my car and my shoes, and possibly making a hazard, and wasting all that money on wasted gas&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
