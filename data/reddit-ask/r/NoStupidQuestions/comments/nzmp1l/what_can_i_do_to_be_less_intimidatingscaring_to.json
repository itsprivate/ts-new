If you know a better fitting subreddit let me please know. Thank you.)</em></p>\n\n<p>So I(25m) am a pretty big guy (6&#39;3). Two years ago I started balding and to not be worrying about my hairline every time I look into a mirror I decided to shave my head and grew a beard. I actually like how it looks. Kind of badass. I also experienced that other men dont want any trouble with anymore, even if they are drunk. Especially my female friends really like this development because my &quot;Jason Statham aura keeps the creeps away&quot; and they feel way more comfortable going out if I am around. As a man thats a nice thing to hear and really boosted my confidence.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that people that do not know me personally stay on distance. I live in a small city and I can get everywhere by the train and just walk home for 10 minutes from the train station. Now ive noticed that people (mostly women) cross the street to not walk past me on the same side of the road, especially after sunset. This already happened to me before I shaved my head but only once or twice and I kind of made excuses for me and them like &quot;maybe he/she made some bad experiences in the past&quot; or &quot; I look maybe a bit creepy in this hoodie&quot;. But now it happens once a week and it really starts bothering me. I dont want anyone else to feel threatened by my appearance. I totally understand why people do this. I did the same in my teens. But it is just a really shitty feeling.</p>\n\n<p>Now I already did some things trying to improve this situation. Like keeping as much distance as possible between me and the other person. I dress properly and keep my beard well groomed. I also asked my female friends what I could do but besides some silly ideas like &quot;wear a shirt with the writing <em>dont worry I am a snuggly teddy bear&quot;</em> they couldnt give my any advice.</p>\n\n<p>So I ask the same question here. Are there any men with a similar problem and know a good solution? I know that I probably just have to get used to this but I appreciate every advice you can give.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
