I’m an older white male and had to go to the Apple store at the mall for a return of a purchase I made online. ( I HATE THE MALL ) I haven’t been in years. While I was standing outside there was this ridiculously beautiful woman and this very older white couple referred to her as mulatto. I google the term and the definition was a person of both white and black parents but then followed with “this is known as a derogatory term”. I personally felt like this word was beautiful and a nice way of saying mixed. I’ve never liked the term mixed cause to me if a human has a child with a human then they had a human child and nothing is mixed. So what is the history behind the word mulatto and why is it derogatory?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
