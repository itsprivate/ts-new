I can&amp;#39;t find a video or even remember the magician&amp;#39;s name, but I was about 5 years old at my adult (mid 20s) cousins&amp;#39; house. I was alone, watching TV, and this magician is doing tricks. Sleight of hand, card tricks, rabbit out of the hat, etc. Standard stuff. Then this guy looks me dead in the eye on the TV, says, &amp;quot;this trick is for you at home. Yes, you. Now, on the count of 3, I&amp;#39;m going to turn your TV off to prove to you that magic is real.\n&amp;quot;No way,&amp;quot; thought.\nI was a fool.\nHe started counting all dramatic, flourishing his hands, &amp;quot;One... Two...&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no way.&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Three!&amp;quot;\nAnd the the fucking TV turned off. &amp;quot;WHAT.&amp;quot; I scrambled for the remote and rushed to turn it back on. And there he was, front and center, standing with his arms behind his back, smug grin plastered on his face. &amp;quot;Now do you believe?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guys this whole thing has been living in my head rent free for decades. I can&amp;#39;t figure it out. There&amp;#39;s no way. This was sometime around 92 - 94. My cousins didn&amp;#39;t have universal remotes. I was alone when it happened and no one believes me. But it was real. It happened. There has to be an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
