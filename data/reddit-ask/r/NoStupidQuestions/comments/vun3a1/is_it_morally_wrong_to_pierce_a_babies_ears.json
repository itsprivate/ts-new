She asked me what my problem was, and I said I don’t think babies should have their ears pierced, as they have no choice in the matter and, it causes them unnecessary pain.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was absolutely certain I was “overthinking it” and I am “crazy” She says most people pierce their babies (usually girls) ears. This appalled me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Giving a baby piercings they may not even want in the future, and causing them unnecessary pain is wrong to me. How can you justify that? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t care if they “won’t remember it” what kind of excuse is that? Would you pinch a baby and make it cry just because it won’t remember in the future?  I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: U N N E C E S S A R Y   P A I N ,\nVaccines, are helpful and necessary. Piercings are cosmetic, and unnecessary. Stop comparing them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I incorrect to think this way? Is there  something I am missing here? because frankly I can’t see how I’m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
