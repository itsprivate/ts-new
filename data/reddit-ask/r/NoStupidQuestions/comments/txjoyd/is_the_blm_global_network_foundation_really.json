I support the BLM movement (which can be separated from the foundation) and I donated money myself. But I’ve been reading a few articles from reputable sources saying that $6 million of the donation was used to secretly buy a mansion for one of its leaders, and they are likely going to continue to squander the money on things that don’t help the movement at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, the foundation is separate from the movement. Unfortunately, this would tarnish the whole movement and fucks over the people who genuinely want to see change. I’m really, really angry if this is true. I’m asking here because I’m not sure if something is being twisted in the reporting to make the foundation look bad. I really don’t want this to be true&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
