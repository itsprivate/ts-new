I was tired and depressed from the 24h news cycles constantly reiterating the same content and headlines. What bothered me the most was how misleading the headlines were when reporters would exaggerate the content or twist the facts in their favour or even outright lie about what was supposed to be reported. It’s gotten to the point that whenever I see headline posted on this platform, I end up going up the comments rather than read the article to see if it’s worth my time to read it because 95% of the time the headline is misleading or outright wrong on the reporting (scientific reporting is often the culprit). Reporting has become less about reporting the facts and truth and more about adding colour to get more views and clicks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And before anyone suggests this, I’m not reading 3-4 articles of the same topic to decipher the truth and facts for myself. I’m sure many others like myself simply don’t have the time to do this and have much more important things to do with our lives. I believe it’s the responsibility of the news agencies to decipher and report the truth to the public in an accessible and accurate manner and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
