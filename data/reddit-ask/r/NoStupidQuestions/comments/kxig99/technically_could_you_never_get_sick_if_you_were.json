Say you lived like Chuck Noland in Castaway, you were completely isolated from every human being. Could you still get the common cold or the flu by yourself? Do those sicknesses start by human interaction? For example, similarly, during European exploration, smallpox was introduced to the &quot;New World&quot;. If you were 100% isolated, is it even possible to get those types of sicknesses? I know the immune system would surely be crap but technically would your body even need to face those sicknesses <em>ever</em>?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
