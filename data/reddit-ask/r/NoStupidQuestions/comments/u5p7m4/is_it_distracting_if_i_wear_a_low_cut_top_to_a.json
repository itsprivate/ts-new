  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a college student in Philly studying English. I have a regular crew of about 5 that I&amp;#39;ve studied with basically all semester (since January). We are 2 girls and 4 guys Since it&amp;#39;s been chilly I&amp;#39;ve usually worn hoodies and also we&amp;#39;re just studying. We&amp;#39;ve been a kick ass study group and gotten As on a bunch of our assignments together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week, since it&amp;#39;s been MUCH warmer in Philly I&amp;#39;ve stopped wearing hoodies. I&amp;#39;ve also gotten so many cute dresses and tops I&amp;#39;ve hoarded over the pandemic and am so excited to wear!! I&amp;#39;m a skinny Mexicana but I guess giant tatas are in my genes LOL so I admit some of my dresses and tops show a decent amount of cleavage. But I&amp;#39;m young, its college, it&amp;#39;s hot AF and I&amp;#39;m just more comfortable tbh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, today a guy I really respect in the group, who has also been really respectful to me, texted me out of the blue. Basically he told me my outfits lately have been really distracting while studying and he said he&amp;#39;s noticed all the guys getting distracted instead of studying. He said I should think about wearing hoodies again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;#39;m shocked right now. I didn&amp;#39;t think wearing a dress to a study session was distracting. I spoke to another girl in the group and she&amp;#39;s more on the guys side!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like some of the other girls definitely wear dresses and show cleavage too. I think I do tend to show a bit more, really just because my boobs are much bigger though which is not something I can really control lol. But I can understand if it can be distracting, especially when everyone is trying their best to focus and study. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want a distraction every time I&amp;#39;m trying to study so I&amp;#39;m empathetic. How should I respond to him/them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: holy crap this is blowing up. Thank you so much for taking the time to read and formulate a response. Going to read through every comment later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve texted the guy since and said that the outfit he was distracted by is literally the same outfit another girl wore last week and he didn&amp;#39;t seem to get distracted or care at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He admitted that&amp;#39;s true, but he said he talked to other guys and they agreed my outfit was distracting so it&amp;#39;s not just him. He also said I could &amp;quot;literally be an anime character&amp;quot; and since he watches anime that&amp;#39;s why ??? Hahaha. I don&amp;#39;t really watch anime so not sure of the relevance except he has brought up animes few times while studying&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
