I used it for a few days, and before I returned it I filled it with gas and washed it since she didn’t ask anything if me in return. After a few hours she called me and seemed genuinely offended that I had done that, but i was always taught that it’s common courtesy. Was it rude of me to wash/fill the car? It’s what I’ve done for years and I’d hate to think I’ve been offending people for such a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: I wash it (only the outside, I don’t move/remove anything inside, and touchless if I can help it) because I work on a farm so there’s a good amount of dirt and mud by the end of the day, but after seeing y’all’s comments I’ll def make sure to ask for permission and instruction before doing that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
