I can barely keep it together despite having 4 weeks paid vacation each year and get paid when I&amp;#39;m sick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My life would be miserable in the US, I would sooner or later just break and end up on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do people come to the conclusion that they want to move to the US and start working there? Personally I would never want to move and work there, it just sounds so damn miserable to live and especially work there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
