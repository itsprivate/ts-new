I feel like my consciousness is mainly in that area. I know this might sound weird, but I want to know if anyone else feels like this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I&amp;#39;m guessing this would have to do a lot with the frontal cortex right behind the eyes where most of our thinking is done and maybe that&amp;#39;s why this is happening. But I would like some opinions on this or if you feel similarly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: Maybe because the brain has the largest concentration of neurons firing at the same time, that&amp;#39;s why I feel like this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: When I close my eyes, I don&amp;#39;t feel &amp;quot;conscious&amp;quot; in them anymore. Only in my brain. So I&amp;#39;m guessing because the eyes have so much neurons compared to all other organs when they are deprived of sensory information (hence, neurons inside the eyes fire less), then I feel my &amp;quot;consciousness&amp;quot; only in my brain area. &lt;strong&gt;So I&amp;#39;m thinking: my consciousness is wherever my neurons are MOST actively firing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
