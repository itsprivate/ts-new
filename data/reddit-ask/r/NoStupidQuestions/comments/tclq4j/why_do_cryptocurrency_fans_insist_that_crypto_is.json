And therefore is a viable currency in times of great strife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, overlooking the fact that there are only a handful of businesses that accept crypto in the raw (namely bitcoin, companies like Microsoft, Tesla, and befuddlingly enough, Burger King), isn&amp;#39;t this just very inefficient?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if some sort of worldwide apocalyptic circumstance these people seem to talk about were to erupt, such as a nuclear bombing or solar flare were to erupt. It it just me, or wouldn&amp;#39;t the internet be one of the first services to grind to a halt, as infrastructure such as power plants, servers and transmission towers are compromised? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also the exchange rate issue, as even if crypto were to somehow be convertible into cash at this point, wouldn&amp;#39;t the money be essentially worthless in a dire post-disaster scenario? If such a event were to occur, wouldn&amp;#39;t people be far more interested in food water and shelter? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the disaster wasn&amp;#39;t that bad, the economy crashing would also make the converted currency less useful? (If I am on the right page here.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
