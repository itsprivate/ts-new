But a lot of the videos seem to be taken without the consent of those being filmed. They’re commonly filmed out a window and whatnot or with a “hidden camera” so get someone’s “real reaction”. Ignoring the fact that this might be illegal, isn’t it just morally a little iffy? Like, I’d be pissed if someone filmed me without my knowledge and posted the video online. I don’t want a bunch of online strangers knowing my face or those of my family members. Seems risky somehow even though it probably isn’t. Have we become to accepting with this? It’s so normalised nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
