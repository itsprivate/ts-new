Apparently it&amp;#39;s very odd to not look at your toilet paper after taking a dump, it&amp;#39;s just never occurred to me to do that. Honestly the idea of it grosses me out, why would I want to bring a ball of shit paper up close enough to me so I can take a look? I just wipe once and that&amp;#39;s that. Never had issues with skid marks or anything unless I actually shit myself which only happens every few months tops.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
