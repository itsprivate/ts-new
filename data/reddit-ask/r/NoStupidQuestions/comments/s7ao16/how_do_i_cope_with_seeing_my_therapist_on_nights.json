My therapist (been working with her for two years now and she is the only one that is working well for me) she is the same age as me. At first that worried me as it made me feel self conscious but soon I forgot about it as we worked well together. However,  a few weeks ago I started seeing her on nights out and actually hanging with people i used to be friends with. This is all making me very uncomfortable and self conscious because she knows ALL of my personal deepest and darkest things along with all my struggles. I am worried she will tell some people and we live in a very small town so word gets around fast. I don’t know if I should find another therapist or not because it’s too late she knows everything about me already and maybe she would tell people if she wasn’t my therapist anymore and stuff would get out then. I have tried numerous therapists over the years but she is the only one I have found to work well with me. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
