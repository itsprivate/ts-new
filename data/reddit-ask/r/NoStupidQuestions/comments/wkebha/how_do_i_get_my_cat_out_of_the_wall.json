We&amp;#39;ve been living here for about two months now and he wanted a cat, so we got one. The problem is, within 2 days the cat living with us, she found a previously unknown to us way to get behind the wall in the basement. We know how she got in and approximately where she sits when back there. There are two ways to get behind the wall from what we learned, and they can both be blocked off by closing a door once we get her out. The problem is, she waits until we go to work or fall asleep to go eat her food. We got a we got a camera and set it up in the room that has her litter box and food, so we get a notification when she walks in. If she so much as hears you get out of bed she goes back to the hole in the wall. In case it is important/helpful, her litter box and food are two floors above where she hides. We borrowed a pressure pad trap and put her food in it to try and trap her upstairs so we can block off the wall, but she seemingly knows it&amp;#39;s a trap, since she opted to starve rather than go inside it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I realize I&amp;#39;m being out smarted by a cat. I&amp;#39;m open to any ideas people have on getting her out so we can shut the door. I can provide more information if I have to. It has unironically been 14 days since someone last saw her in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
