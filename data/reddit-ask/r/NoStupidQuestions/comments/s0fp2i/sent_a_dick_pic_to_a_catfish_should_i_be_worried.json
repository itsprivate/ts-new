I get a message complementing one of my posts and then they immediately say they have a cuckold fetish. I agree to play along and do the dirty stuff for a bit. They ask me to send a dick pic in which I do like the idiot that I am and then they tell me that I just got catfished. I didn&amp;#39;t mind deleting the pic since they had already took a screenshot of it so I just deleted my entire account. I was completely anonymous only showing my genital area and nothing else so I&amp;#39;m not too worried but I just can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling of me being a complete idiot. Funny thing is, I had a feeling I was being catfished but I was too dumb and horny to even realize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To any of you who have done the same, how did you deal with it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If by any chance you see this, whoever the fuck you are, I hope your enjoying the sight of my cock and balls.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
