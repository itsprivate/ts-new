  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, tonight  me (19 male) and my sister (17 Female) argued over our cat who kept jumping over my bed  not allowing me to sleep during the night, our walls are thin and my parents room is directly connected so they heard us, our mother&amp;#39;s boyfriend was extremely angry and started calling my sister a r&lt;em&gt;tard and a w&lt;/em&gt;ore, immediately after he started beating, her beating lasted 15 minutes after of which he litteraly kicked her out of our home, this whole thing started at around 10 P.M and she only returned thanks to our mother who didn&amp;#39;t care enough and litteraly sent me 2 hours later, when she returned he litteraly told us that he would&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;educated us&amp;quot; through beatings and that he would have murdered our pets, I have a cat and a dog and he has always despised them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What really terrifies me is that he always threatened to use violence on me and my sister, as well as our beloved things, I&amp;#39;m a reader and he always absolutely despised the fact that I read books, he litteraly calls them toys and made for me impossible to obtain books without the cultural bonus of 500 euros given by our government given to all 18-19 year Olds that were born In a specific year.. in 2022 the bonus went to those born in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He litteraly showed that he never cared about the items of others, my sister had posters of her favorite k-pop artists and he tore them to shreds with racist excuses for what he did after the fact, the fact that he destroyed my sisters loved belongings worries me about the safety of my beloved few books that I have since he always expressed his willingness to burn them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How he behaves with our mother isn&amp;#39;t good either since he has rage attacks when she received messages on her phones that he doesn&amp;#39;t like, an example I can give is when my doctor&amp;#39;s studio sent her an automated message telling me &amp;quot;good birthday&amp;quot; this caused an enormous rage in him who dragged my mother to the studio and litteraly threatened the doctor, this extremely toxic behavior has been going on for 4 years now and my mother still defends him as he never did anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of this situation and I want to denounce him to the police but I&amp;#39;m scared that he will retaliate on me and my loved belongings as well retaliate on my sister, idk what to do anymore since I&amp;#39;m already on antidepressants and I can&amp;#39;t leave because I&amp;#39;m unemployed and housing here is very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m in italy so our social services probably work differently than in the U.S&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
