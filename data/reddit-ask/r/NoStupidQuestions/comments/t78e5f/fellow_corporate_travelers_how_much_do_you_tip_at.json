My coworker saw this and said I should never tip above 15% since it’s not my money to “give”. My argument is we have the $50 and no official policy on tipping so why not reward servers as I see fit? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Reddit…what are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I am in the US and travel in the US, mainly to small towns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
