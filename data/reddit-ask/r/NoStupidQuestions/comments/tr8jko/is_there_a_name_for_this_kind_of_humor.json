Knows everything about trees and helped me landscaped my backyard.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I love that lmao. Is there a name for this or a subreddit? I guess maybe this is just punny/dad jokes? But it’s different. It’s like when people purposely misunderstand what you’re saying then take the conversation in a different direction that just makes no sense but is silly. Anyways I think you get the point. Any help?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
