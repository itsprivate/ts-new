This afternoon my neighbor across the street came over and complained to me about cars parked in front of his house last night. He told me that he doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone parking in front of his house especially late at night when his daughter gets home from work. I explained to him that the streets are considered public unless you live on private property. He then gets angry and says &amp;quot; well I pay taxes on my house so I feel I should have a right to not have anyone park there&amp;quot;. He also said he will get the police involved if he sees it again lmao. Can my neighbor legally reserve a parking spot in front of his house? My neighborhood is pretty busy and cars park in front of my house all the time and I don&amp;#39;t complain. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
