I don&amp;#39;t have a good relationship with my parents so maybe that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s different for me, but even walking around in bra when I am with them sunbathing in our garden I am just incredibly uncomfortable. If they saw me naked, well, I think I would be traumatized for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He finds it absolutely normal and said that when we have kids he&amp;#39;d like to keep walking around in his boxers because he&amp;#39;s always hot and finds it stupid to walk around fully clothed in his own home. I am on the edge about it. What do you think and what are your experiences? Do you think it&amp;#39;s...normal?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
