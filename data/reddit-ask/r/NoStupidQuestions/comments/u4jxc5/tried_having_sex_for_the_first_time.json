It was the first time for both of us so we were a little lost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It went normal to start and then I got nervous and was not hard which was very embarrassing even though she repeatedly said it was not. I couldn’t get and stay hard when we tried to do it out of me being nervous with being late to go home, someone maybe seeing us etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that when I tried putting it in, but I could not get it all the way in and I don’t know why.
