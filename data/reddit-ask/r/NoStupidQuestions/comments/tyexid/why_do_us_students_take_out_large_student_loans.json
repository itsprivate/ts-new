  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen complaints about student loans ever since I started using Reddit. US private universities are ridiculously expensive, but they aren&amp;#39;t the only universities on earth; I&amp;#39;m pretty sure there are much cheaper options in the US. It sounds entitled to do something stupid, like taking on life-enslaving debt, then blame the system or other people for their own choices. If you don&amp;#39;t want debt then don&amp;#39;t take out loans (unless it&amp;#39;s life-threatening), literally that easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why didn&amp;#39;t more US parents prevent their kids from taking out huge loans? Or if they did, then how did so many people blindly waste godly amount of money on useless degrees?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reference, 1 year of tuition fee in a high-end US university is $50k. Meanwhile, I know many poor foreign students in Finland/France/Germany/etc who managed to live fine on $15-18k/year (before Covid, haven&amp;#39;t checked price since then)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: just want to clarify I&amp;#39;m not against college, but against forcing oneself into debt slavery. That means finding cheaper options if possible, or only take out loans if you&amp;#39;re certain your salary will be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
