  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved into an apartment in the city about a month ago. I live on the top floor of a three-story walk up, and I only have one neighbor who lives in an identical unit across from mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve never formally met him, only occasionally bumped into him when leaving. Our interactions never went beyond smiling and saying hello.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my neighbor got a small package delivered a while ago. It’s kind of an unspoken rule in my building to carry smaller mail sent to our neighbors to their front door so they don’t have to go down to the lobby to retrieve it. Since it’s on my way up, that’s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The package has been sitting there for a while. I don’t remember exactly when it got here, but I want to say it’s been waiting at his door for 1-2 weeks, possibly more. That feels a little strange to me, because I normally hear my neighbor enter and exit through the front door (I work from home) and I can’t recall him doing that recently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I realize there are perfectly logical reasons as to why he’d be gone (i.e., vacation, staying with an SO or family, etc.). But I can’t help but think that, in spite of all that, something could be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I knock on his door to see if anyone answers and/or if my neighbor is okay? Or would that be overly paranoid or rude of me? I don’t want to overstep, but I do hope nothing bad happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
