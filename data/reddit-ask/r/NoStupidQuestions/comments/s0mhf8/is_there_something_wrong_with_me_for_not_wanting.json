I hate doing baby talk. I feel like I want to run away when I hear a small child cry rather than to run to them to comfort them. I can&amp;#39;t bear spending time with my friends when their children are present as it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to have a conversation. \nI don&amp;#39;t mind older children, say from age 8 or 9 where you can have an actual conversation with them but I also don&amp;#39;t want every minute of my life to revolve around them. \nDoes anyone else feel this way or am I just weird? Like it&amp;#39;s pretty much our evolutionary goal to pass on our genes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I am not repelled by children, and although I said my &lt;em&gt;instinct&lt;/em&gt; is to run away if they&amp;#39;re crying - if that child was alone or not with it&amp;#39;s parent/guardian I would comfort them and help them. I&amp;#39;m not a monster. Everyone I know tells me their kids love me. I love my nieces/nephews. I simply wanted a place to express how weird it feels not to want them. Thank you. P&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
