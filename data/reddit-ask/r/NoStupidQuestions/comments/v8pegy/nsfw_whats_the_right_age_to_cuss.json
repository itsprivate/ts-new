I don’t really have a problem with cuss words. I use them all the time, and so does my wife. My boys made a presentation and explained that all their friends cuss, and they would like permission to be able to do the same. They said they would do their best for us not to be able to hear them cuss, and they wouldn’t do it in front of other adults. I was taken aback, cause I never asked my parents, and just started to cuss with friend. However, it just feels so freaking weird to say I approve. What should I do in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
