What I mean by that is usually it&amp;#39;s not something like &amp;quot;ok let me practice for this upcoming job interview&amp;quot; but instead &amp;quot;here is a hypothetical conversation I would have with my brother about blah blah blah.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like it might be a way to blow off steam, or organize my thoughts, or even just me trying to be prepared for things to go down, but it&amp;#39;s difficult to not think that I&amp;#39;m just crazy. Do any of you do something similar?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to also add that I&amp;#39;ve been involved with theatre since middle school, so maybe I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;rehearsing scenes&amp;quot; to get my thoughts organized. I don&amp;#39;t really know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: alright, good to know I&amp;#39;m not alone in this! Thanks for taking the time to answer; at the very least I can cross off one of the many reasons I might be crazy ðŸ¤£&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
