So I&amp;#39;d like to avoid joke answers like make a move or shit like that because it&amp;#39;s a pretty awkward situation right now. I&amp;#39;ve just gone out to get takeout for dinner for us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my roommate brought this girl over last night from Sydney. Slept with her and they&amp;#39;re going to he staying here for a few nights. She has a friend who I&amp;#39;ve made the guest room up for. I didn&amp;#39;t speak to her last night because it was 1 am when they came home. I just made the bed for her and that was it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s just so akward trying to make conversation with her while my roommate and this other girl are all over each other. She feels uncomfortable because I&amp;#39;m essentially a stranger and she&amp;#39;s staying with people she doesn&amp;#39;t know. While her friend is on a autumn fling. And I&amp;#39;m a little uncomfortable with situation because we can hear them/see them making out with each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m just sitting here in a Nando&amp;#39;s parking lot trying to make the situation a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
