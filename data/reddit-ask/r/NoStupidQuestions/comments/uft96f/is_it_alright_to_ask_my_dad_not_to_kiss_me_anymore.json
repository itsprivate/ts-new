Touching, joking, giving advice when not asked,  and so on. Well my biggest issue is that my dad likes to kiss my neck or back. I hate it. It literally makes my stomach knot and I have told him on multiple occasions that I do not want that. He&amp;#39;ll make the excuse that &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not sexual&amp;quot; and my response is Idc, I still don&amp;#39;t want it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This last week I flew home for my brother&amp;#39;s wedding and I was chatting with my mom outside. My dad comes out and starts massaging my shoulders and I can feel myself getting irritated but say nothing.  He then leans in and kisses my bare back (spaghetti straps). I yell at him, &amp;quot;I know I&amp;#39;ve said this before. I don&amp;#39;t like that.  Do not kiss my neck, back, of anywhere.&amp;quot; My mom then calls him out after I have confronted him and he walks away all huffy. Slams the door and throws some stuff around the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sees nothing wrong with his actions and I am besides myself.  This bothers me a lot. My comfort and boundaries are not respected.  I don&amp;#39;t feel it is right and I hate him for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
