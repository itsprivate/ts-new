I&amp;#39;m not talking about trans folk that wear clothing that helps them feel more in line with the gender they identify with, I&amp;#39;m talking about cis men that dress up in drag for fun, or for parties, for twitch streams, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My understanding of why blackface is offensive is that it incredibly exaggerates the features of a person of color, through literal pitch black face paint, giant lips, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the instances of drag I&amp;#39;ve seen have done similar things, exaggerating feminine features/stereotypes; giant tits, pounds of makeup, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another related thing is voice. If a non-black person spoke in a style akin to black folk, it would be seen as offensive, but drag queens will often speak flamboyantly to sound more feminine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can someone please explain to me why a non-black person acting and dressing themselves up as a black person is offensive, but a non-woman acting and dressing themselves up as a woman isn&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
