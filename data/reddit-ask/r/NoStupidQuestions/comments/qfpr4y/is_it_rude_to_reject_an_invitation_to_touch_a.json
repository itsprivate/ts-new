I was the only one not touching her belly and she came over grabbed my hand and tried to put it on her belly. I pulled my hand back and told her that I didn’t want to feel it because it kinda freaks me out. Everyone gasped and was staring at me like something was wrong with me. She’s a nice girl and I hope I didn’t hurt her feelings. I just don’t like touching people that aren’t my friends or family. Also, this same coworker was touching my hair a few months ago when I had extensions (I change my hair a lot) and I was very uncomfortable but I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to come off as rude. I guess I could’ve just done it so I don’t look like a social outcast but it was a knee jerk reaction to pull my hand back. Are her feelings hurt? Will they think differently of me?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
