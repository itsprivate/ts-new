It’s weird but I can’t possibly be the only one. Have you ever experienced “flashes into the future?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Déjà vu describes that uncanny sensation you&amp;#39;ve already experienced something, even when you know you never have. Meaning that you feel like you’ve been in a place before or something like the current situation has happened before but you can’t remember. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A deja vu is not the same as these sort of “flashes into the future” that some people get. Because we can vividly remember those scenes. Just to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
