I was offered a plea deal in pre-trial for one and a half years. I declined and took it to trial. Prosecutor is looking for max sentence because of rising drug figures in the county, presumably to make an example out of me, 5 years, with no record.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are some talking points I can hit on, in my 5mins I get to speak directly to the judge? I don’t want an entire script, I just need to sound articulate, somewhat intelligent, and not appear to be a complete bottom feeder. My life hangs on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
