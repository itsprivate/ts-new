  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my boyfriend is highly educated in the field of science. We started dating a few month ago. I have no university degree and I never wanted to study or anything. But somehow being around him and his friends who are all scientists I felt I want to do something with my life too. Right now I work at a night club, I am a dancer - not a stripper! I was the one who was more or less chasing him. He is handsome and very intelligent. A rare combination. He told me he has little experience with girls, he only dated 3 women and I found that weird because he is really, really good looking. A bit quiet and introverted but it was OK. I am loud and have lots of energy. And one night I told him I would really love to go to university too. That I want to be educated too and I would like journalism. His reaction was - for that you need to know how to write properly and read properly. Your vocabulary is poor and I imagine you haven&amp;#39;t read a book in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had tears in my eyes but I insisted. It was dark in the room and he did not see my tears. I told him I know I am not educated, but I really want to become and I am willing to make efforts. I told him I want to do something with my life. He didn&amp;#39;t reply, just waited a few minutes in which no words had been spoken and then he started kissing me and undressing me. We had sex. After that we talked and I told him he made me feel bad about myself, like I am not good enough for him. He shocked me for the second time telling me that he is very selective of those whom he lets near him - friends, girls, colleagues and that me and a friend of his are the only people who can get in his apartment. You are special, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thanked him but now I feel so stupid. Should I try to talk to him again about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
