  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (22M) was in a relationship with my now ex (22F) for 3yrs. We got together back in 2014, and she was my first girlfriend, my first kiss, my virginity. We had the best possible relationship we could imagine. We got together on December 15th 2014. About six months into the relationship i promised her i would do anything possible to make her happy. She was there for me when my father died, and was most supportive everytime i would have a hard time missing my mother (i lost my mother in 2012). I was raised that way to always treat women like princesses, and respect the like i would want someone to respect my sister. We had an amazing relationship, we would throw surprises for each other, i would organise picnics, she would organise trips, and we would do anything together. Fast forward to December 15th 2017, it was our 3 year anniversary, and i bought a ring to propose to her. We met up that day, before I went to work, talked, kissed and i left, everything was fine. When i got back from work, i showered, took the ring and met up with her. I planned out the whole night. We were gonna go to her favorite restaurant, after that to the place we first kissed and then to the place i first told her i loved her, that&amp;#39;s where i was gonna pop the question. We didn&amp;#39;t get to do any of that bc when we met up, she told me she wanted to talk to ne about something. She proceeded to tell me that she was cheating me with my best friend and that it was going on for a month now. At first i didn&amp;#39;t believe her, but then she showed me pictures of them kissing, and their texts. I was crushed, but i looked her in the eyes, and reminded her of the promise i gave her. I asked her if she was happy, and she replied that she was. Keep in mind that all of my friends knew and no one wanted to tell me. I&amp;#39;m still not speaking to them, but i say hi when i see her or him on the street. They broke up about a month later btw. She asked me to get back together with her about 2 years ago and i said no and explained to her that what she did killed me, changed me, and that i wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to trust her ever again. She then said i never cared about her because i didn&amp;#39;t rage out when she confessed about her cheating, not knowing that i spent 3 years healing, and crying over the fact that i lost her. So, AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
