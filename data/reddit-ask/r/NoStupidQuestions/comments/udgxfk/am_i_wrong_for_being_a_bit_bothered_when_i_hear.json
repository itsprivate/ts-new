While I absolutely see the hardships that women go through for simply being women, especially in a high school setting where there are a numerous amount of simps and weirdos that don&amp;#39;t just view women as other regular people, I often hear the phrase &amp;quot; fuck all men&amp;quot; or that &amp;quot; all men are bad&amp;quot; and it just upsets me so much. I won&amp;#39;t deny the reality of alot of women, even my own girlfriend who frequently gets comments and maybe just straight up harassed when walking down the halls and walking in public. It sucks to see, and thats definitely an issue that cannot be ignored, but when talking about men overall, I often hear these extreme generalizations and I feel that it&amp;#39;s extremely unfair. I&amp;#39;ve spoken to some people about this and they&amp;#39;ve told me that if it doesn&amp;#39;t apply to me then I shouldn&amp;#39;t be upset, and while I don&amp;#39;t care for the opinions of others to the extent that I&amp;#39;ll get heated over this, sometimes I feel like, especially at my age, it&amp;#39;s not a good thing to hear for regular men who aren&amp;#39;t harassers and are doing they&amp;#39;re best at being good people. I always feel like people get really upset when generalizations about women are made, and rightfully so, but no one seems to see that generalizations about men are wrong too. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I&amp;#39;m open to any discussion, I obviously dont know everything and can&amp;#39;t speak on the experiences of all people ever&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
