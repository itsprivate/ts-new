That person is sending me emails asking what they could’ve done better and why they were not selected. They were not selected because they didn’t even know what the job they were applying for was and I had to explain basic things that were even in the title of the job. Other than that, they interviewed pretty well with the questions. I would’ve hired them otherwise, honestly. Do I reply? Id prefer not to but am I obligated? Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
