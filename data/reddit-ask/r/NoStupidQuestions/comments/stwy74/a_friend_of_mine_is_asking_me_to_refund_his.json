  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, so let me give you all some context. I&amp;#39;m a young person who loves &amp;amp; makes music. About a month ago, I got invited to sing at a friend&amp;#39;s party. He offered me a very reasonable price as I had to rent some professional gear (including lighting, audio, a sound card...) from a guy who&amp;#39;s known as a DJ in my town. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He brought the stuff by car and he set it all up before the party. We tested the gear before the event and it all worked properly. This was also the case during the party itself. I remember it was pretty late, so me and my friends decided to go home and leave the gear at the place for the rest of the night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, we came back in the morning at roundabout 10am and we tested the gear once again with a couple people I know and the people who were cleaning up the mess from the night before. Everything was, once again, working properly and there were no signs of damage whatsoever. Later that day, the owner of the gear came back to the place to come get all of his stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t hear anything of him for about 3 weeks, when I got a message of him on my phone. He was saying that one of his speakers had &amp;quot;clipped&amp;quot; and that I would&amp;#39;ve been the last person using these particular speakers. He told me that nobody has used them since then even though I was sure the speakers both worked perfectly the day after the event. He had tested the speakers (3 weeks too late?) and one of them &amp;quot;wasn&amp;#39;t working properly&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was accusing me of &amp;quot;clipping&amp;quot; and breaking his pretty expensive speaker. Therefore, he asked me to refund him a rather big sum of money. I told him that we tested both of the speakers as well as the rest of the gear and we had videos of this testing, but he was acting stubborn and he was telling me he couldn&amp;#39;t hear if the speakers were both working due to the video being mono. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why, after 3 business days, he&amp;#39;s still asking me to refund an entirely new speaker and I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s planning on changing his mind anytime soon. Well, if he wasn&amp;#39;t a guy whom I know personally and if he wouldn&amp;#39;t have been from my town, I would&amp;#39;ve probably cared less about this situation, but he lives very close to me and he&amp;#39;s known in town. At this point, I&amp;#39;m just afraid to spot him at parties or wherever. I&amp;#39;m not willing to pay at this point in time, because there&amp;#39;s no proof of me breaking his gear at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I do feel stressful and annoyed, because a good friend of mine and a known DJ in town is mad at me for &amp;quot;breaking his gear&amp;quot;. I usually don&amp;#39;t do this, but I&amp;#39;m feeling absolutely desperate at this point. Therefore, I&amp;#39;d love to hear all about your opinion. Please leave a comment to let me know how you would handle this situation!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind regards&lt;br/&gt;\nA person on the internet&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
