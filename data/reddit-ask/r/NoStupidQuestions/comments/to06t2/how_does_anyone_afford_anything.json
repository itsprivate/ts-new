Like we make we’ll more than the median income but the idea of buying a new car or a house is out of the question. I’m just confused as to how anyone can have a down payment for a house. A cheap cheap cheap house in my area is like 200k how the fuck are people getting 40k saved up for a down payment? Is everyone around me a millionaire and I’m the only asshole making this little money? Or is everyone in the US right now taking out loans that they can’t afford for these homes and cars? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I’m either crazy because I’m the only one not comfortable taking on debt that size or I’m crazy because I’m the only asshole that’s not making money hand over fist to be able to afford this stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m just so confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
