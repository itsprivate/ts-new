I decided to check if there were any men’s only gyms but I could not find a single one. What’s odd however is, there are well over 10 woman’s only gyms. This just seems odd to me, maybe I’m being dumb it just seems very odd. Personally, I’d love a space to work out with men as I have my insecurities and fears per se and I would just feel a lot better in a male-oriented gym space. Looks like I might just have to be the one to open one up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
