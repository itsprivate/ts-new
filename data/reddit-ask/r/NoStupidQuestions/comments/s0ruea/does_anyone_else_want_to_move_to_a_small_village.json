  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long ago I had a panic attack and since then I have been living with a lot of stress and panic in my life. When I got the panic attack I didn&amp;#39;t know what it was and I literally thought that I was about to get a heart attack and die in my bed. Since then the idea of death has been dwelling on me, and while learning about it and coming to peace with the idea of it, I still think a lot about what I want to do with my life before it inevitably comes to an end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really really wish to just live in a village with like 200 inhabitants in a nice beautiful place in the middle of nowhere, where there is no internet and anything like that. Just living the rest of my life as the owner of a small farm growing my own crops and living off my own food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have, especially since covid, been starting to look down on modern society, it just makes me sad. I started to see how fake everything is. Everything is an ad, or a fight for popularity. People are becoming more and more possessed by social media and it just sucks to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I talked to my parents and they told me they understood what I meant. So after I finish university I will look into all the possibilities I have. Of course I wont be able to achieve my &amp;quot;my neighbor totoro&amp;quot;-type dream life (or stardew valley), I really want to move somewhere without internet and people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know a place on reddit where there&amp;#39;s other people like me who I can talk to?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
