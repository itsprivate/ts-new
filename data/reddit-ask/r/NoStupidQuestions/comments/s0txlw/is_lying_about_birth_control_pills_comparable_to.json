Commenters pointed out that that could legally be considered a rape since there was no consent for &lt;em&gt;unprotected&lt;/em&gt; sex. So then I started thinking what would happen in the reverse case: A girl claims she&amp;#39;s on birth control but isn&amp;#39;t and might end up pregnant against the wishes and consent of the guy. Could the girl&amp;#39;s act be considered criminal? Obviously an unwanted pregnancy is usually much more disruptive for the girl&amp;#39;s life but it could be harmful for the guy as well, both socially and financially. So how would legal systems tend to handle such cases?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
