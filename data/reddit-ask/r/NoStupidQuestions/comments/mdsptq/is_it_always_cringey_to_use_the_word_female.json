I mean..is it just me? </p>\n\n<p>I thought maybe it didn&#39;t have anything to do with man vs. male, I thought maybe &quot;man writer&quot; just sounded weird to me because my &#39;default&#39; is--unfortunately--male and I just feel weird clarifying it, if that makes sense? But no. Male writer sounds completely okay.</p>\n\n<p>Because when I was learning the language I was taught the translations of all these words in my native language, and there is a very clear distinction there between which ones are only nouns and which ones are only adjectives. </p>\n\n<p>Now with people correcting me about my use of &quot;female writers&quot; I&#39;m starting to doubt that it&#39;s the same case in English.</p>\n\n<p>Male and female are adjectives, to be used when you&#39;re referring to the sex because it&#39;s relevant. You can have a male writer. A female octopus. With lions &quot;the females will hunt while the males sleep&quot;. These are all okay. Man and woman are nouns. For humans. You can&#39;t have a woman octopus. A man writer. If you say &quot;females do this, males do that&quot; it goes back to being an adjective emphasizing sex, and I totally get how that&#39;s dehumanizing. Women do this, men do that. This is how it&#39;s used. Or--NO?</p>\n\n<p>Am I wrong?</p>\n\n<p>Please help.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
