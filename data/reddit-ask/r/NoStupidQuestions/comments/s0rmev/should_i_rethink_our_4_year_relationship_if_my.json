  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I (23F) and boyfriend (35M) have been dating for four years. We started dating right after I joined campus, and throughout I&amp;#39;ve never asked him for anything. While at school, my parents were not able to give me a pocket money, but I had a part-time job as a waitress and most of my fees was paid off by government bursaries, I only had to pay for the hostel.  During the pandemic most hotels closed down and thats how I lost my waitress job. Right after campus, I got unpaid internship that required me to work full time so I was using my little savings mostly. The company is yet to give me a full time job and I am really struggling, though they promised me this year. My boyfriend knows all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been doing online jobs, if I ever get any. So my rent has been due for 2 months and the landlord has been on my neck. I paid off some of the rent with the little money I had and now I owe the landlord $650.  Since we started dating this is the first time I&amp;#39;m asking my boyfriend for any kind of financial help and he outright refused. He has a stable job but doesn&amp;#39;t want to help me with the rent just this once. All he wants is for me to move in with him. Since last month I&amp;#39;ve been begging him but he says no and I&amp;#39;ve asked him severally if he can loan me the money and has also refused. I really love him, but he is very controlling and has anger issues. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be comfortable having constant fights with him everyday. Last time I slept over at his place on a weekend he slapped me over a misunderstanding. He apologized. This is why I don&amp;#39;t want to move in with him. He has been calling me to ask of I&amp;#39;ve packed my clothes and ready to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has gotten me really thinking and I&amp;#39;ve decided not to pick up his calls anymore. I know he is not obligated to help with my rent just because we are dating. But I&amp;#39;ve always taken care of all my bills without his assistance. Am I just being petty or should I really rethink our relationship. Coz what&amp;#39;s the point of calling someone my ride or die if he can&amp;#39;t support me in such a desperate situation. I might be homeless but he doesn&amp;#39;t care, yet I have no one else to count on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
