  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian President Zelensky&amp;#39;s speech before the attack:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have initiated a call today with the president of the Russian  Federation. The result - silence. Although silence should be in Donbass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is why today, I want to come with an appeal to all citizens of  Russia. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a  citizen of Ukraine. We share more than two thousand kilometres of  border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers;  thousands of military units. Your leadership has approved their movement  towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step can  become the start of a big war on the European continent. The whole world  is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at  any moment. Any provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential  of burning everything down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of  Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;. But the people of Ukraine are free. They remember their past,  and are building their own future. They are building it, not destroying  it, as you are told everyday on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in  reality are two completely different countries. The most important  difference is that ours is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are being told that we are nazis. But how can a nation be called  nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate nazism.  How can I be a nazi, when my grandfather has survived the whole war as  part of the Soviet infantry, and has died a colonel in an independent  Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a  culture be hated? Any culture. Neighbours are always enriching each  other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not  separate people into “us” and “them”. We are different, but that is not a  reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully,  calmly, and truthfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are told that I am ordering to attack the Donbass. To shoot. To  bomb without questions. Although there are questions: To shoot at whom?  To bomb what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donetsk? To which I have been dozens of times. I have seen their faces and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Artema street? On which I have been on many walks with my friends in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donbass arena? Where I have been rooting with the locals for our boys during the Euros.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shcherbakova Park? In which we were drinking together after our team has lost&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lugansk? The home of my best friend’s mom. The place where my best friend’s father is buried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia  understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all  foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are  you going to fight for? And against whom?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you have visited Ukraine in the past. Many of you have  relatives here. Some of you studied in our universities. Befriended  Ukrainian people. You’re familiar with our character, with our people,  our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you,  listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The  people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want  it, and we make it. We do everything in our powers. We are not alone.  It’s true, Ukraine is supported by many countries. Why? Because we are  not talking about peace at any cost. We are talking about peace, and  about principles, justice. About everyone’s right to define their own  future, of safety, and everyone’s right to live without threat. All this  is important to us. All this is important for peace. I know for sure  that this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don’t want  war. Neither cold, hot, or hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if we are threatened; If someone is trying to take away our  country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going  to defend ourselves. Not attack. Defend. By attacking us, you are going  to see our faces. Not backs. Our faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;War is a big distress, and it has a big price - in all meanings of  this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life,  freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose  themselves. A lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in  abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands. Tens of thousands  of deaths. You are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not  true before, not now, and won’t be in the future. You are demanding  security assurances from NATO. We are also demanding assurances of our  security. The security of Ukraine from you. From Russia. And from other  signatories of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random  security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of  our neighbours. That is why we are now talking about the security of all  Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our  citizens. Of Ukrainians. We are determined to let everyone know about  this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of any assurances.  No one will have assurances of security.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who is going to suffer from this the most? The people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who does not want this more than anyone? The people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who can prevent all this from happening? The people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If these people are among you. I am sure they are. Public figures,  journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers,  stand-up comics, tiktokers, and others. Ordinary people. Ordinary,  simple people. Men, women, old, young, fathers, and most importantly -  mothers. Just as much as the people in Ukraine, no matter how much they  try to convince you of the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that my announcement will not be aired on Russian television.  But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth.  And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it’s too late. And if  the authorities of Russia don’t want to talk to us, for the sake of  peace, maybe they will talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do the people of Russia want war? I would’ve very much liked to be  able to answer this, but the answer depends only on you - citizens of  the Russian Federation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Credit to &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/u/nelyubov\"&gt;/u/nelyubov&lt;/a&gt; for the translation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
