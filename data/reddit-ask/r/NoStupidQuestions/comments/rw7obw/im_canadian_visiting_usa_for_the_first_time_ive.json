I made blueberry cheesecake from scratch, even boiled down blueberries to make a syrup. It was nice. Maybe a couple people had a piece. I ended up picking at it over the next few days but ended up throwing away half of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my circles in Canada, this would be a humongous fuck you. If someone makes food for an event, you either try some of the food, or at the very least, compliment them for their efforts and provide some sort of excuse why you&amp;#39;re not gonna have some. (on a diet, lactose intolerant, too full from dinner, etc)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only reason I would not try someones food (or excuse why I couldn&amp;#39;t) would be to signal that I did NOT like that person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only solution I could come to is that the insult was entirely unintentional and that its just cultural difference. I really hope that I&amp;#39;m right on that one. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Regardless of how the comments thought of this as some cultural war crime of me to ask such a generalized question about our countries, I did manage to come to the conclusion that it is indeed likely just a cultural difference. Solved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;#39;all need to relax, damn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
