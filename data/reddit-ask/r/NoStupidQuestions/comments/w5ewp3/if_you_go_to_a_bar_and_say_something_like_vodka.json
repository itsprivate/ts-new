I’ve heard people in shows say stuff like “vodka soda” and I’m always like…. Okay but which soda?? If you want Jack Daniel’s with coke you say “Jack &amp;amp; Coke”. Makes sense. But if you just say soda what are you getting? Can I say “vodka coke” or is that wrong? Someone enlighten me lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: this whole time… you people have been drinking unflavored soda water?? I am disturbed 😭&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update update: Some of you don’t understand what a joke is, I don’t actually care that you drink seltzer relax Jesus Christ. I playfully insult your drink and now you’re in my comments acting crazy 💀&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said “I don’t like plain soda” and about 20 of y’all came for me like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/3Ih-q7D-wi8?feature=share\"&gt;https://youtube.com/shorts/3Ih-q7D-wi8?feature=share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
