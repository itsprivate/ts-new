Women in a managerial position can wear slacks, but wage slaves, they have to wear skirts. Women are encouraged to wear makeup. It&amp;#39;s viewed as unprofessional for them to not wear makeup to work. Flip this into men, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if a man got disciplined for wearing makeup to work regardless of how flawlessly done or neutral looking it is. I&amp;#39;ve also heard in some jobs women have to wear heels as part of their dress code. I have an ex who had to wear heels to work and all she did was wait tables and polish silverware. Idk how heels come into that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sexism is blatant, but why is it okay? Why is it allowed?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
