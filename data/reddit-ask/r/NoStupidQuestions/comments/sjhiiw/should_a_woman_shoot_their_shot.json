And asking a guy out just makes you look desparate. I guess I took it to heart. Both times I made moves towards crushes, it ended badly. The first time, I was 15 and the second time was yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so confused. On one hand, making a move and getting my answer felt liberating. I now know for sure he wasn&amp;#39;t shy, he just wasn&amp;#39;t interested and I can move onto someone else. I don&amp;#39;t have to waste weeks/months waiting for someone to make a move, which is what I usually do. I&amp;#39;ve probably wasted so much time when realistically I could&amp;#39;ve made moves towards crushes after a few weeks, rather than letting them build and build unity rejection feels much worse. But in the other hand, I&amp;#39;m like &lt;em&gt;no mom was right, look what happened both times you initiated something&lt;/em&gt;. It has hit my self esteem a little. I know realistically I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;ugly&amp;quot;, I get hit on multiple times on nights out, moreso than my friends and I&amp;#39;ve been asked out like 20 times at least. What&amp;#39;s the answer?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
