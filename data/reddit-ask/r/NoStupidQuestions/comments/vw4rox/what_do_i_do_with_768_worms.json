Laterdays !&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I quit my job and took roughly 768 worms with me. Now in hindsight I should have thought about what to do with them BEFORE I took them, but something told me I could figure that out later since the worms were all cold(they’re in my fridge right now) \nMy question is how do I take care of them ? They’re typical fishing worms but I don’t fish, or have any animals that would eat worms. I’d dig in myself but the box says unsafe for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
