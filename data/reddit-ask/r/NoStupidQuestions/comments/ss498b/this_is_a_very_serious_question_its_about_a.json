  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of my family has gone missing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They left behind their car, their money, and all of their forms of ID. The only thing they took with them is a duffle bag and 2 changes of clothing.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We called the cops and when they ran their social through their computers the cops said his digital existence had been wiped clean. They had no employment history, no tax history, no school records, they didn&amp;#39;t even recognize it as a legit social security number.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, my question for YOU is.... Who has the power to do that?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did this missing member of my family get sent into the witness protection program? Did they erase his digital past?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first we were all fearing the worst. Then we stared to think maybe they ran away to start a new life in another country or state. But, now that the cops have said someone erased his digital existence. We&amp;#39;re really baffled as to what to think.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either witness protection or.... he joined the Men In Black. Those are the only two things I can think of.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing is. They have a secure letter writing program. He&amp;#39;d have written his mom a letter by now. It&amp;#39;s been 2 months since he went missing. Could the letter still be on it&amp;#39;s way? Do they make the person wait six months before they let them write letters to their family? I looked it up and it says they DO let you write letters to your family. But, it didn&amp;#39;t go into any details.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
