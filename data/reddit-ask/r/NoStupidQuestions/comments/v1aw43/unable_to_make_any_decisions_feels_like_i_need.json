I feel like I desperately need handholding to do even minor things like Getting an LPG connection, getting my bike serviced.. etc.. I postpone it for later. To be honest it feels if someone could just stand and order me around on what needs to be done I&amp;#39;ll probably do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when push comes to shove, I am actually able to do these things ( that&amp;#39;s how I am able to proceed with my life ). But this pushes me into a loop where I am always working on the edge. This leads to extreme stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I end up spending a lot of time on reddit/playing games when I should rather spend my time elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this may sound stupid, but I don&amp;#39;t know  how to resolve this situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any resource, recommendation etc is much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
