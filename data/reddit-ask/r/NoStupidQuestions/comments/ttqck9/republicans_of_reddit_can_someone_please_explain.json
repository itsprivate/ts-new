The article is titled “Gaetz sends Nadler hard drive containing contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop.” Since this controversy’s inception, I’ve been unable to find any evidence of wrongdoing or illegality and the articles are just word salad that imply a crime but cannot articulate the crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***To all of you who have replied with thoughtful, based arguments around conflicts of interest and potential financial wrongdoing and corruption, thank you for your genuine, good faith feedback. It has helped me to see the other side of the issue and it does seem like there is something to be looked into. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, for those who pulled weird, conspiratorial talking points about child porn and Biden’s niece, please understand the disservice you are perpetuating in constructive public discourse. You are the reason that many people look at the GOP as a fringe group of whack jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
