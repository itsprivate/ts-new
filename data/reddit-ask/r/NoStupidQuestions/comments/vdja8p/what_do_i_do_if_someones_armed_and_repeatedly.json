I tried to go around him and he moved into my path again. I tried again and he just kept doing it all the while hurling really vile insults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to touch him even by accident because he had a gun. Ultimately, after a solid minute of not making any forward progress and actually backtracking because he stayed in my face, I turned around and ran back the direction I came. He yelled some more awful stuff but at least didn’t chase after me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shaken. Because I had to go around  a whole another block to get where I was going, I was 15 minutes late and missed my appointment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What am I supposed to do if this happens again?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
