Have we just collectively given up on trying to protect each other because of how many people refused to do anything related to preventing COVID so they could go out and party instead or because &amp;quot;MASKS PREVENT YOU FROM BREATHING!!!!!!!&amp;quot; nonsense?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like...I&amp;#39;m legitimately at a loss, going out and seeing people act like this disease which has killed so many already isn&amp;#39;t still around killing so many more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
