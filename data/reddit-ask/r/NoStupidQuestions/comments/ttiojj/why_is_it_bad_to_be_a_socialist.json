Just the other day I got a free x-ray. Wait times are no problem. I also got to visit a therapist for free after my grandfather died. I honestly see very few down sides to socialized medicine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public transport is amazing. Trains and buses run constantly to help people get from place to place. There are also free transport programs for children getting to school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parental leave is paid for both mother and father. And even crazier to the American people, high school students (gymnasiet) student get a stipend of money while in school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is any of this bad? Please American, tell me!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
