But before it could be mailed, the kidnapper saw what she did and tortured her, making her rewrite the letter while looking over her shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Handwriting experts weren&amp;#39;t able to deduce duress from the letter the kidnapper sent, and no one was sure if she was being held against her will or not. So how could one communicate duress secretly in a letter like that? I was thinking, maybe pressing the pencil down a little harder at the end of the letters h-e-l-p, just enough for investigators to notice if they very closely analyzed the letter. But Idk that sounds too obvious. What would you do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
