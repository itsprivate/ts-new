I hugged her today, let go, and gently grabbed the top part of her left arm. It freaked me out that I felt some kind of object in her arm. It was small and kind of slim? Just below the skin as well. Kind of like a stick or something, I’m not entirely sure. We’re still getting to know each other so I didn’t ask her what it was, and she didn’t seem to notice that I felt the object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m racking my brain to think of what it was. Would anyone know of what kind of small object someone would have in their arm, just below the skin?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I asked her and she told me it was Implanon (birth control). I’ve just been researching it since I had no idea it existed, quite interesting how it works. Its effectiveness is actually wild. Thank you everyone !&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
