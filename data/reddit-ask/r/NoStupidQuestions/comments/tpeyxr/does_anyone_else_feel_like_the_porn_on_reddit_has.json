The subreddits lose what makes them unique once you just have random girls posting random things on subreddits like when white girl who is clearly 100% white post on an Asian girl subreddit or when a girl post a video of vaginal sex on a subreddit meant for blowjobs etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems like if you click on a nsfw profile it’s just tons and tons and tons of the same exact photo with the same exact title and caption. So if you’re subscribed to at least a few of the same subreddits that those girls post on then you see the same girl over and over for days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have an opinion on this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
