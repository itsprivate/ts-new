I still need help with some things and I&amp;#39;m working towards becoming more independent over time. But before I found the support I need it was quite hard because there&amp;#39;s way more resources available for autistic children than adults. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look up autism on Google Images, you have to scroll pretty far to find a picture of an autistic adult. Even all the first results for websites have only images of children in their articles. It&amp;#39;s pretty clear that when someone thinks of autism, the first thing they think of is children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#39;s with the lack of the representation for autistic adults? A lot of them can&amp;#39;t get the support they need because the only support in their area is specific towards children&amp;#39;s needs. It&amp;#39;s not even uncommon to believe that autism goes away with age, unless you&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;low functioning&amp;#39; enough. Even though that&amp;#39;s impossible, you cannot grow out of autism no matter where you are on the spectrum, people still believe that myth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it because as we age we gain more life skills and appear to &amp;#39;grow out&amp;#39; of autism? And therefore children need more support than adults? But many adults still need support, why is it so hard for them to get it, especially if they can mask well or appear &amp;#39;high functioning&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
