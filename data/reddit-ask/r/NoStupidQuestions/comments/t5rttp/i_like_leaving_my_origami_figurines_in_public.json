One time I&amp;#39;ve accidentally left a pink crane on a bench. When I realized I wanted to go back and pick it up, but then I saw a woman who picked it up and put it into her bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since then I started leaving little animals (cranes, crabs, butterflies, elephants, dinosaurs, dragons, etc.) around the places I visit often. I usually leave only 2 at one place because I don&amp;#39;t want them to be alone. They usually dissappear pretty quickly and I always assumed that people pick them up and keep them. But one of my classmates noticed that I left some cranes on a desk this morning and he said that I&amp;#39;m littering. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t want to bother people. Am I annoying? Should I stop?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: thank you for the very kind responses! I&amp;#39;ll keep making origami then! It really makes me happy that other people appreciate them haha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
