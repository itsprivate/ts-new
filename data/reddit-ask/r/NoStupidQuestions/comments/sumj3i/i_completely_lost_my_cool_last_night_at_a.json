I was livid, since I had a long day at work and I drove back to the restaurant. I banged on the counter and the manager, who couldn&amp;#39;t have been older then 19 or 20, came out. I slammed the burger without a patty down on the counter , and starting yelling and swearing at the kid, granted he started getting a bit hostile and threatened to kick me out if I didn&amp;#39;t  calm down, I yelled at him and told him just to fix it. Eventfully he did, I grabbed my bag, and berated him again telling him hes a shitty manager, and he started getting a bit  defensive, which I don&amp;#39;t  blame him, I was being an asshole . I stormed out before calling him an asshole. When I got home I realized what an asshole I was, and how I acted was completely uncool. I feel bad for the kid, I could tell nobody has ever yelled at him like that before. Should I call the restrung tonight, and apologize. I really feel like a scumbag for going off like that, I was just exhausted and stressed out from work, the burger being messed up just set me off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
