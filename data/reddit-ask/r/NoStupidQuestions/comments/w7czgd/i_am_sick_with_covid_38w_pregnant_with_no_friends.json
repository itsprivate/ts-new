(And now with Covid I can’t have them come in and risk exposure were they to decide to finally show up anyways). \n I had been doing dishes regular in the sink but now I’m having trouble with it draining it’s making it very hard to have any clean dishes to make any food..&lt;br/&gt;\nSo I have been eating out of paper plates and bowls.. just whatever food doesn’t need to be cooked that can be placed in it but I am &lt;strong&gt;desperate&lt;/strong&gt; for a home cooked meal 😭.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if I could get a couple dishes washed I have been bed bound for days, standing is an incredible exertion, I can’t imagine trying to place an online order for groceries and standing long enough to cook anything. Even getting up to go use the restroom causes me to breathe heavy and feel dizzy sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So..I really &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to accept their offer, I was hoping to say “actually there is something, but please let me know if I’m over stepping with this, would it be possible to pay you for ingredients and time in trade for some soup? I could stop by for a no contact pick up outside your place if you’re okay with this. If you’re not I totally understand and no worries!” (I have been to their house once for a visit)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past once before this person made me homemade zucchini bread just because they could, they’re much better at cooking than I am and have their life together in a way I could only dream of.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just.. I really don’t know if the offer is just some false thing that people are expected to say and if it’d actually be rude to accept it. I was raised in an environment that left me never relying on others or asking anyone for help no matter how badly I need it. But I really really need some help right now, I know it’s pathetic but I’m struggling so badly. I know I’ll be okay without the soup, but I’ve only had like 10ish bites of the food that’s around my house in the past 3 days, which there isn’t a lot to pick from because I got sick right before my grocery trip and I’m mostly out of everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; I finally got the courage to ask for a home cooked meal with me paying for time &amp;amp; ingredients doing a no contact pick up outside their place and they said….  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m always happy to cook! What are you craving? I’m sure we can grab ingredients and work out a safe drop off tomorrow, but I wouldn’t make you pay. I just like taking care of people with food, haha!”  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guys I’m literally crying, I wouldn’t have been able to ask at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; if not for you all giving advice, I’m so thankful for their help &amp;amp; everyone’s help here. It’s such a good/bad feeling having to ask basically an almost stranger for food because I don’t have anyone in life to help me but I’m very thankful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
