  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR the title, but I’ll give more context. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a conservative, fundamentalist Christian home. Went to small, private, and VERY conservative fundamentalist Christian schools from 4th grade all the way through grad school (my MA has nothing to do with religion but I did get it from a seminary). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that info, it’s probably no surprise that sex was a no-no taboo subject. I got all the damaging lessons…women who have sex before marriage are non sticky tape and pre chewed gum and no Christian man will want them. Same sex relationships….not discussed. Ever. It was so far out of the realm of reality that us “good kids” would be “tempted” that way that it wasn’t talked about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first sexual experience was at the age of 22 and not 100% consensual, which, again not surprisingly, fucked me up a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very long story short, I went through a lot of questioning and deconstructing, and am pretty happy at where I’ve landed with my faith. Still consider myself a Christian, but a liberal one who firmly believes God does not give a crap about sexual orientation, love is love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So onto the problem at hand. I am married to an amazing man. Seriously. He’s my best friend. Our relationship is rock solid. I have no desire to leave, I want to spend my life with him. But I am realizing that I am not 100% straight. That a few of my friendships with girls ended painfully with full no contact because there were romantic feelings involved. In my “figuring shit out” stage I had a threesome and I’m realizing I really liked being intimate with her. At the time, I rationalized it as enjoying the thrill of fulfilling a guy’s fantasy and doing something so “wrong” despite my upbringing. But as I work to educate myself on sexual orientation, gender identity etc, I am realizing I am attracted to women as well as men. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do I do with this? I talked about it with my husband and he’s fine with my sexual orientation, but obviously not with me cheating. Neither of us want an open relationship. I don’t necessarily want to act on these feelings. I want to be with my husband. But how do I validate this part of me? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this too long or not appropriate for this sub. I just feel like it’s a really stupid question lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok I want to make a quick edit, just to clear something up: I have zero desire to sleep with anyone besides my husband. I have talked through a lot of this with him, he’s helped me get to this realization. I am just learning something about myself that a lot of people figure out as a teen or young adult as a 40 year old woman (with half my life being defined by sexual repression) I just don’t know what I’m supposed to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. Coming out seems like a term I shouldn’t use since very little of my life will change. So right now all these things are alone in my head (and with my husband and therapist) and I just….want steps to take? To know I’m ok taking no steps? Both? I don’t know. I just really really want to make it crystal clear I am NOT looking for validation, excuses, pushes, or anything else to cheat on my husband. Ok, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
