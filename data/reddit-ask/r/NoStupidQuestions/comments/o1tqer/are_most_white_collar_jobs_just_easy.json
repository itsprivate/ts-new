I got promoted VERY quickly at my first job and I&#39;m a pretty well-paid project manager, almost hitting 6 figures annually and reporting to the top executives within the first few months.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure if it&#39;s impostor syndrome, but I legitimately feel like anyone could do my job. All I do is sit in meetings all day while the VPs talk about things, most of which aren&#39;t even related to my current projects. A lot of what I do is just talk to people and make sure everyone&#39;s on the same page, as well as reminding everyone about their deadlines and bridging everything together so it executes smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like you could replace me with just about anyone with some education and a smidge of competence &amp; emotional maturity. As long as my subordinates are doing their jobs correctly, this project really runs itself. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been looking at job postings. My position now usually would require 5+ years of experience, and that&#39;s in the ballpark of what HR&#39;s asking for new hires, for the same responsibilities I&#39;m handling now. But I&#39;m completely green and yet I&#39;m going smoothly, even getting better performance evaluations than those who&#39;ve been here much longer. I just think I have the better team.</p>\n\n<p>Is this really what it is? I had impressions that top executives had some sort of special knowledge and have it all figured it out, but really, it seems all these positions are almost useless, with most of the actual work getting done by the rank-and-file employees.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
