For example, my old boss would send me emails like &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hi animalcule, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left the supplies on the table...\nSee if you can finish the assembly by noon...\nThanks...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--Bryan&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who grew up with written communication on the internet, the ellipsis reads as a weird vague &amp;quot;trailing off&amp;quot; tone. It&amp;#39;s clear that the people using it don&amp;#39;t read it that way, though. My friend suggested that perhaps the boomers think that the &amp;quot;...&amp;quot; feels less definitive or demanding than a standard period at the end of a sentence. Mostly I&amp;#39;m wondering where it came from and why it&amp;#39;s so common among that age group.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
