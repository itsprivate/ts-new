I’m just there conceptualizing how I want to express these thoughts verbally.</p>\n\n<p>But for some reason whenever it comes time to speak, something disconnects in either my mouth or my brain and I can’t get what I want to say out. It’s like have a glitchy spam filter in my mind that won’t let anything come out at all nonetheless the good stuff. </p>\n\n<p>For example I’ll be thinking about how to explain to others what my dream is, why I want to do it and why I’m qualified to achieve it. But the minute I want to even try and say these things I freeze, stammer and throw out ‘um’ and ‘uh’ like I forgot what I was going to say even though I very well know what I wanted to say.</p>\n\n<p>It’s frustrating. I’ve got these things I want to be able to express but something in my brain is stopping me. I want to be a conversational person but I don’t want to keep rambling and stammering to the point where I’m dragging everything on far too long. I want to be able to get my thoughts out there but nothing wants to come out right if it even comes out at all. I’m really sad about it, that’s as simply as I can put it.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: I can’t get what I actually want to say in my head out there verbally and it sucks. It’s like a major brain-to-mouth block or something.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone out there understand where I’m coming from? Regardless as always any and all input is welcomed and thanks for reading! 🙂</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
