But here&amp;#39;s the funny thing, before the pandemic, I would get sick 1-2 times per year during Fall/Winter. I would get bad colds or the flu. It&amp;#39;s been that way since I was a kid. I just catch sickness so easily and always had to deal with it annually. However, ever since I started wearing masks in 2019, I haven&amp;#39;t gotten sick once- no cold, no flu, no Covid, no sore throat, and no sniffles. It&amp;#39;s been over two years since I&amp;#39;ve gotten sick and I&amp;#39;ve never gone that long without even catching a cold. And I don&amp;#39;t always stay at home. I go to stores, to the mall, go to church and even take the subway sometimes. I just always wear a face mask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if masks are useless and don&amp;#39;t work, then why haven&amp;#39;t I gotten sick in over two years?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
