I have no idea how can one prepare to live in a war zone, and I don&amp;#39;t want to panic but I&amp;#39;d rather be ready for at least &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; than just sit here and wait for what&amp;#39;s to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks. I wish you all a peaceful sky above your heads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: oh and by the way, is there something to do with the apartment itself? I don&amp;#39;t know maybe like some sheets or platic over windows etc&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
