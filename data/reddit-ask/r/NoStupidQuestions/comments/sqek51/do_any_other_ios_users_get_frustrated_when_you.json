Then as soon as I hit space it changed it to “Sears.” So I backspaced and changed it back to “sears,” hit space again to keep on writing, and sure enough it changed right back to “Sears.” So then I have to backspace again, retype in “sears,” and then wait for the little autocorrect box to pop up, x-out of it, and then I can finally continue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that’s a lot of “sears” and a lot of words for a small thing, but it’s just a pet peeve of mine. Like, why can’t autocorrect figure out that when I type in the original word for the second time, that’s the word I want, not whatever autocorrect thinks it should be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still have autocorrect on because 90% of the time it helps, but these little things where I have to override it multiple times in a row are annoying. Idk. I can’t be the only one right?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
