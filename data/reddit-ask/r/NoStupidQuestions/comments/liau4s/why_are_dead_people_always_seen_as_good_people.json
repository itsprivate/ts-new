Everytime someone dies they were the best people in the world, the things thay have done were great and overall they were the perfect human being. You could say that someone&#39;s movie sucks, then they die and, only then, you get treated as a disrispectful little b****, just like if dying makes you a good actor. Like, i don&#39;t understand. If someone close to you died and you knew them then sure, but if 40 people die in a flooding why do you say they were angels... Like, there are a lot of bad people in the world, i&#39;m sure some of them died in an accident before it was found out what they have done and everyone is still going to be like &quot;rip, we&#39;ll miss you, you were the greatest angel&quot;. I genuinlly don&#39;t understand, can someone explain this to me?</p>\n\n<p>edit: 69 upvotes. nice</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
