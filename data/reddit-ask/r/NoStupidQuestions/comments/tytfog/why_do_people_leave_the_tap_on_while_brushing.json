Do you turn the faucet on to rinse the toothbrush before brushing, and then just leave it on from then on? Or is it a conscious thing to turn it on once you commence brushing? Just... why??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Many people are saying something along the lines of &amp;quot;water is cheap/free&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not that much compared to other wasteful things&amp;quot;, but honestly I&amp;#39;m not even asking because of that. I used the analogy below a couple times of turning the tap on while you pee. Like, how did this habit even start?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: On the subject of wastefulness though, maybe one person leaving the tap on while brushing wastes an insignificant amount of water in the grand scheme of things, but a poll found that 35% of Americans leave the tap running while brushing. That&amp;#39;s about 115 million people. So let&amp;#39;s say that&amp;#39;s twice a day for two minutes with an average faucet flow rate of 1 gallon per minute, we&amp;#39;re talking 460 million gallons wasted per day! Even if that number is off by a hundred million, that&amp;#39;s still a shit ton of water. Turn your damn taps off people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2018/06/04/one-three-leave-tap-running-while-brushing-their-t\"&gt;https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2018/06/04/one-three-leave-tap-running-while-brushing-their-t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
