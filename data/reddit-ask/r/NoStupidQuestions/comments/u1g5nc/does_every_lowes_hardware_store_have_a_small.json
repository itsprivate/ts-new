Like they came in from outside and are now in the store. The stores can’t really do shit since they’re way the fuck up high. Do they come inside and get trapped? Do they know how to get out? Did they come in on purpose just to build nests and shit? So do they just die of starvation and fall to the floor? If there’s anyone here that works at Lowe’s, can you please tell me what happens to these birds? And have you ever found a dead bird on the floor during your shift? Tell me if your local Lowe’s has birds in the rafters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
