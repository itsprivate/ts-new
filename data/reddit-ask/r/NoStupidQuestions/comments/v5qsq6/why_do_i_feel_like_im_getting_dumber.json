I used to feel smart, I’d be able to think quickly and carry out conversations but now I feel like I’ve lost that entirely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has only gotten worse lately and it’s made me reclusive and shy. My motivation is down the gutter. I feel like I’m on autopilot, even the most mundane tasks feel completely mindless. I can’t watch movies without constantly rewinding because I’ve lost focus. I find it difficult to hold conversations because they feel like utter nonsense most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There more aware of it I become, the worse it gets. Genuinely feels like my mind has regressed. Is this normal?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
