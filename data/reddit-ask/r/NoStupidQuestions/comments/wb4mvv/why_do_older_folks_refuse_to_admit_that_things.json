One grandfather never even graduated high school. The other was a couch salesman. But yet they were able to achieve the &amp;quot;American dream.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;INB4 &amp;quot;they worked hard and struggled!&amp;quot; Yes but they &lt;em&gt;got something for it&lt;/em&gt;. Thats how it used to be. You struggled but eventually had something to show for it. Now I feel many are struggling just to tread water, struggling just to survive. To have the lives my ancestors had with the careers they had is impossible now and yet...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you talk to many older folks they will give you the whole &amp;quot;no one wants to work&amp;quot; &amp;quot;just get a better job&amp;quot; &amp;quot;millennials are lazy&amp;quot; &amp;quot;kids these days&amp;quot; cliches. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can they not see the data? The numbers? The facts? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some recognition would be nice. Its hard enough that the price of things rises seemingly everyday, but its insult to injury to be told you just arent working hard enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
