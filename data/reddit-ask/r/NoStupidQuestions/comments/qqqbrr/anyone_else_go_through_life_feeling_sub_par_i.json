But I was wondering if anyone else felt the way I do. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been average or less than average on most everything in life. But I knew from an early age I wasn’t very smart. And although I waited for any hidden skills or talent to form, nothing ever did. </p>\n\n<p>I understand you have to apply yourself. I tried that for several things but basically the older I got the harder life got and the more I realized I feel like a waste of resources. I don’t offer much to the world other than being fairly “nice” I guess. </p>\n\n<p>Seems most people are innately good at skills or have talents. I never had a single talent or skill.  Now Im 40 ish and feel now it’s too late to even bother and im really worried I’ll never fully be financially stable or blessed with a great life etc. because of how the universe made me. </p>\n\n<p>I try to be at peace with it but it’s always frustrated me and frankly kind of upset me that although I’m “nice” and don’t want to harm a fly, I feel the universe skipped me and in fact made me severely flawed. </p>\n\n<p>Im grateful for what health I have but even they got taken from me at age 30 due to to a herniated disk I can’t afford to fix that ultimately leaves me in chronic pain and discomfort. </p>\n\n<p>Im not really depressed but it’s hard to find happiness. I wish I would have been like almost any member of my family. Gifted with some skill or way to make some things easy. Money. Love. Talent. I know not all these things are gifted to you but it seems they come a lot easier when you have skills and talent. </p>\n\n<p>For example, I never could memorize times tables. I couldn’t tell you a favorite movie or book because I have no real interest. I seem to have been born disinterested in sex, was not blessed well endowed, and stayed with the first person who showed an interest which has led to a unsatisfactory relationship for both parties. </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on.  But I often wonder if I’m alone in this? </p>\n\n<p>I could be gone tomorrow and it wouldn’t matter. A few people might miss me, my dogs sure would, but sometimes I wish this thing called “life” was more enjoyable and fulfilling like it seems to be for basically most people around me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
