I was screwing around in Google Trends and, behaving like the pervert that I am, I noticed that google search interest in hentai PRECIPITOUSLY dropped between those two months, and hasn&amp;#39;t fully recovered since. I would post screenshots of this phenomenon but the subreddit doesn&amp;#39;t allow it. Weirdly enough, it&amp;#39;s not just hentai. A bunch of other related search terms also dropped dramatically at the exact same point in time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The search terms I found that all match this drop are:\n&amp;quot;Hentai&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Hentai porn&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Ecchi&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Japanese porn&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;JAV&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Tentacle porn&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Furry porn&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Tentacle porn&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Rule 34&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Fap&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Masturbate&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this sounds like a sarcastic joke post, but these stats are real. Hop on google trends for yourself and see. I&amp;#39;m just so unbelievably curious what could cause such a significant drop in all these fetishist interests in such a short time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any insight, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
