I have to wear knee length dresses because my legs are &amp;quot;sexual&amp;quot; in leggings. This is all year round (on a beach, in my home, outside my home).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, men can go around in their t-shirts, shorts, and wear all the perfume they want. &amp;quot;Girls can control themselves, men can&amp;#39;t&amp;quot; they said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the age of 8 my body / everything about me has been sexualised. I can&amp;#39;t do/wear anything without it affecting the men. Talk about a man-made religion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My nMom did not like that I came downstairs, where my male cousins were, in my pyjamas (a 3/4 sleeve, knee length t shirt + pyjama bottoms). She said I should be ashamed for dressing like that, I will go to hell, that good things should be kept hidden. Bear in mind, I am in my &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; home, and have walked into a room with my parents, male cousins + their mother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is so fucking sexual about my arms?? Are they going to jump me right there in front of their mother because they saw my arms?? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the fuck is this mentality? I&amp;#39;m so done with religion. How are they allowed to treat girls/young women like this, and it be considered okay/for their benefit? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not asking to go anywhere naked/wear anything revealing, nor am I saying there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with wearing long sleeves; but sometimes I want to wear a short sleeve t-shirt in my own home. I should have that choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
