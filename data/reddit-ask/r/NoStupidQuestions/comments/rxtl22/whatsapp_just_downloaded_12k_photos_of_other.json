I&amp;#39;m talking photos of IDs, selfies, graduations, baby pics, family photos, screenshots and all sorts of other sensitive data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A pattern I&amp;#39;ve seen is that the people are from my local area, there are multiple if not dozens of different families and people&amp;#39;s photos mixed in there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something serious happened here. Someone seriously fucked up on META&amp;#39;s side or Google.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is what the hell do I do about it. This seems like a serious breach or malfunction in the encryption software.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if this happened to these people, there&amp;#39;s odds my things ended up on other&amp;#39;s people&amp;#39;s phones. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
