I&amp;#39;ve noticed that sometimes if I&amp;#39;m speaking in Spanish out in public with another Spanish speaker people nearby who only speak English will get upset and tell us, &amp;quot;this is America, we speak English here and you have to learn the language!&amp;quot;    I&amp;#39;m wondering why they get so upset, considering that our conversation has nothing to do with them.   If I ask why they get upset, they say it&amp;#39;s considered rude.  And nowadays, you run the risk of upsetting a Karen type who will potentially cause a scene or become violent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have gone to amusement parks where there are a lot of tourists from different countries and if I hear whole families speaking in their native tongue that I don&amp;#39;t understand, my family and I don&amp;#39;t get upset or feel threatened.  We actually enjoy hearing different languages and dialects from other countries.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not understand why it is considered rude.  If I am speaking to you I will speak in a language that you understand.  Otherwise, the conversation is none of your business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
