  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My girlfriend and I went kayaking today (Upper Peninsula of Michigan) and we stopped along the shore multiple times to find rocks. On one of these stops, we noticed that behind a row of trees there seemed to be a field. I wanted to check it out so we did. It turned out to be a pond just behind the trees, their shores maybe 10 feet apart but it smelled really gross. </p>\n\n<p>We started back to our kayaks when I said that it smelled of something dead and rotting. (When I was younger, I’d seen a dead possum floating in water at a golf course, and it smelled just like that).</p>\n\n<p>My girlfriend gave me a weird look and went back to check the smell again and I followed. It again reminded me of that smell only it was much stronger than the possum had been when I was younger and despite us looking, there was no animal near us to be found. </p>\n\n<p>We turned back to our kayaks and saw what looked like something was dragged in the sand through the spot we’d stood at to look at this smelly pond. We thought it was odd but figured maybe it was a beer cooler. We’d seen some beer cans on the small lakeshore. </p>\n\n<p>We got back in our kayaks and started to paddle away. We kept close to the shore and discussed what could be making that smell and the drag marks when we heard something in the woods off to our right. It sounded like something was walking through the woods, what I assumed to be either a person or a large dog. I’ve never head a bear before but I suppose it could’ve been that as there are bears in the UP. </p>\n\n<p>I started towards the noise with my kayak &amp;  told my girlfriend to not follow me toward the shore. The sound stopped as I got closer. After a few minutes of silence, I started paddling back to my girlfriend. </p>\n\n<p>She told me she thought she heard someone say “stop, they’re right there” coming from the woods. We discussed this for several minutes while kayaking back towards our cabin. My girlfriend then also brought up that she heard voices when we were originally looking at the pond. I told her I too had heard them then but I assumed them to be far away, possibly even across the lake and just traveling over the water. My girlfriend thinks she heard it near the pond, more towards the woods than lake. </p>\n\n<p>So what we have in all is:\n-we saw drag marks with no footprints\n-had a smell of something rotting\n-heard something/someone walking in the woods \n-may or may not have heard someone talking nearby</p>\n\n<p>Should we do something?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
