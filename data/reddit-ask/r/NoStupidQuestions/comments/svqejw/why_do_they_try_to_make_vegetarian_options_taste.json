It would just seem odd to me that  moral vegetarians would go for something like, &amp;quot;tastes like a dead animal!&amp;quot;, or am I the only one who thinks this is a bit odd?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Follow up question. It seems like a lot of people are against the cruelty, which makes sense. But does that apply to hunting? Or I know a family that owns 150 acres in the Dakotas and raise their own beef, and they only have like, 3-4 cows, would you eat either of those? Or it&amp;#39;s it that animals are being killed for consumption?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT v2: Sorry for all the follow up questions. Thank you all for taking the time to answer questions and help me understand! I grew up eating meat, and from MT, so did everyone else. So I never really had anyone to ask or was never able to really understand! Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
