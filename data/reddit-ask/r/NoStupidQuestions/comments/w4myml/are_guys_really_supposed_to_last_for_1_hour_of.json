We discussed body counts and like dos and donts just to kinda help eachother out as friends but then I asked her about how long a guy should last. She’s been with 4 people so I wouldn’t really call her inexperienced but she said all 4 of the guys lasted around 1 hour and I made sure she knew I was referring to just penetration. Has she just gotten really lucky or is this actually the normal time a guy should last because I always assumed if you get like 15 minutes out of yourself down there you did a pretty good job lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
