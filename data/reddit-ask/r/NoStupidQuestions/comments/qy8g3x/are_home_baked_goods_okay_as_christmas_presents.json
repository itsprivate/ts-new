Would a handmade loaf of bread and a handmade jam (my stuff is really good) be offensive as a gift to people? Like too low effort or something? And does the jam need to be exotic or can I do a safe flavor like strawberry, for the jam? Should it be more than one loaf? I&#39;d appreciate the help here  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: You guys are really helpful, I worried because a lot of my friends have gotten me things.. that i still treasure to this day, but I only now can reciprocate and I worried it wouldn&#39;t be enough, or seem to be too chinchy. And I didn&#39;t have a lot of money, but what I do have is time and now skill. And I can afford to get bows and bread bags to wrap them up nice. You all made me feel a lot better and I&#39;m super excited to make them now.  I really enjoy baking </p>\n\n<p>Lol one of my friends found out about my &quot;famous&quot; cupcakes yesterday and has requested them for her birthday next year and I&#39;m stoked. Lemon Bar Vanilla cupcakes with fresh raspberry buttercream frosting. It took me  a while financially to finally get all my baking tools and supplies... i&#39;ve not been able to make things for years until now, and I want to share.. okay sorry for the ramble</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
