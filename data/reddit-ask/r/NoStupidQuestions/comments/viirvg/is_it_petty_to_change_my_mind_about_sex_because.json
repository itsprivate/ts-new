We’re both 14 almost 15 and have been together since last year, I don’t want to rush into sex but he said everyone is doing it at our age. I feel comfortable but I’ve been having second thoughts because of certain things he said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) He said he was allergic to latex, but we’ve used latex gloves in class with no issues before. Plus they make latex free condoms but he said they always have a small percentage of latex in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) even when I bring up that bc won’t protect from std’s he’d say “so what you’re saying is you don’t love or trust me” which I feel is super manipulative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel comfortable losing my vcard like this but we’ve messed around with hands and mouth before, and I feel like I’d be a prude if I didn’t. When I have said I had second thoughts he called me petty because I was withholding sex from him because of his condition (latex allergy) now he won’t talk or touch me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
