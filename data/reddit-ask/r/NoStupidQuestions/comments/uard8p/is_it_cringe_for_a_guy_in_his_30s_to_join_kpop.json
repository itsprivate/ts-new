I absolutely love choregraphy of modern k-pop groups. I was itching to do something physically demanding for some time, because I feel I have a lot of unspent energy. So naturally I began thinking about trying joining some k-pop dance courses in my city and try out something I have a great admiration for.\nHowever when I presented that idea to my girlfriend and her sister (who are also both into k-pop), they were cringing about that idea and told me that I would just be laughed at.\nI get it, I&amp;#39;m not 20 anymore. So should I just forget about it and find something more &amp;quot;age-appropriate&amp;quot; for me? I hate that idea that just because I&amp;#39;m older, some activities are &amp;#39;cringe&amp;#39; for me to do. But if majority of people view that the same, I will just forget about the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
