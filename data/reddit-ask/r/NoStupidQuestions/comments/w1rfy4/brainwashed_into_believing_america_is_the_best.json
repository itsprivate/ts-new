Just graduated college a while ago. After I graduated highschool and was blessed enough to visit Europe for the first time...it was like I was seeing clearly and I realized just how conditioned I had become. I truly thought the US was &amp;quot;the best&amp;quot; and no other country could remotely compare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That realization led to a further revelation... I know next to nothing about ANY country except America. 12+ years of history and I&amp;#39;ve learned nothing about other countries – only a bit about them if they were involved in wars. But America was always painted as the hero and whoever was against us were portrayed as the evildoers. I&amp;#39;ve just been questioning everything I&amp;#39;ve been taught growing up. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been &amp;quot;brainwashed&amp;quot; in a way if that makes sense? I just feel so disgusted that many history books are SO biased. There&amp;#39;s no other side to them, it&amp;#39;s simply America&amp;#39;s side or gtfo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone share similar feelings? This will definitely be a controversial thread, but I love hearing any and all sides so leave a comment!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
