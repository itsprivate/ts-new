I used to hate spiders but I&amp;#39;ve come to appreciate them since I need help with pest control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a way I could help make it more comfortable or say thank you somehow? I&amp;#39;d also like to learn more about common household spiders from an any educational site but I&amp;#39;m not sure where to start or what is best. Google can be overwhelming. I know this sounds crazy but it&amp;#39;s the least I can do for them for helping out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
