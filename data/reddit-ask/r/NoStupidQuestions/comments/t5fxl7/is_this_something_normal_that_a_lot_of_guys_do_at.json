They’re divorced now so that’s why the friend was honest. I think it’s extremely immature and shows that you don’t truly love who you’re marrying and it made me really sad to hear. Either way i don’t think it makes a difference for how i feel about it, but is this common? I know strippers are very common at bachelor parties although i don’t agree with that concept either. But having sex with multiple women right before you get married is way over the line imo. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
