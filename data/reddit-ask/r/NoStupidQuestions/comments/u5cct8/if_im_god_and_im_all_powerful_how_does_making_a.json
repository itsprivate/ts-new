So essentially Jesus sacrificed his own life in order to save everyone from sin, or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Sorry if I have it really wrong)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what I don’t understand is, how is that a sacrifice? Jesus was the son of god, and had premonition of his inevitable resurrection. God made Jesus in the first place, and could presumably make another child if he wanted? Why does letting him die amount to any type of sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and how does his supposed sacrifice actually connect to all the other people in the world?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case it isn’t obvious, yes, I am an atheist. And no, I’m not trying to argue against Christianity or anything like that. I’m trying to understand the significance of Easter from entirely within the “facts” presented in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
