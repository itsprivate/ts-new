Even statistically speaking, it&amp;#39;s not likely that I&amp;#39;m less or more attractive than ALL of my friends, so I don&amp;#39;t see why wouldn&amp;#39;t I be approached as well. I&amp;#39;d say I look friendly and approachable, I go out often, but.. it just never happens:D All of my relationships started on dating apps, I never met anyone trough common friends, at work or in university. Does it really mean I&amp;#39;m less attractive than average?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
