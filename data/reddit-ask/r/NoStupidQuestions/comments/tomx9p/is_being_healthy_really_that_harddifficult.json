So much stuff you should do and shouldn&amp;#39;t, the more I read the more overwhelmed I get. I can imagine that many of us feel the same, like if we have to follow a certain definite structure and can&amp;#39;t include or indulge in anything &amp;#39;unhealthy&amp;#39;. And when looking up &amp;#39;healthy&amp;#39; recipes, they differ quite a bit from &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; ones (like exchanging all rice and pasta to quinoa and other alternatives, which is really up to individual taste but there is a certain trend in &amp;#39;healthy&amp;#39; recipes). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is, isn&amp;#39;t being &amp;#39;healthy&amp;#39; mainly just eating regularly and try to include vegetables and fruit, exercise and if you eat sweets or chips here and there it&amp;#39;s no big deal? Feels like the word &amp;#39;healthy&amp;#39; is turning more mentally challenging than physically&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
