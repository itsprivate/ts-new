This is something I’ve been wondering about forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, it seems like my body just produces a lot of slime in general. Like, whenever I have a cold, it’s cold outside, or I’m allergic, I just get an insane amount of snot. If I blow my nose there will sometimes be like more than two large spoonfuls of snot on the paper. But that’s not all. My dentist said they’d never seen anyone produce so much saliva. I also produce a… LOT if precum, and will get huge wet spots in my underpants during foreplay.  I can also shoot pretty huge amounts of semen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve been wondering about whether the fact that my body produces so much of these three types of slime is somehow connected, or if it’s just a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for this disgusting post &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
