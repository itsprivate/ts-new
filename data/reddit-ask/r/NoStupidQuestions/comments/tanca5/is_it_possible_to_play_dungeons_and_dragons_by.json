I really want to try this game, so I&amp;#39;m wondering if there&amp;#39;s a way I can kind of test the game and see if I like it before I putting serious effort into finding people to play with in real life, as well just a general curiosity if there were any solo campaigns in this game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also love to hear  a free and easy way to play online if such a thing as exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
