They can’t breathe normally, they overheat more easily, and in some cases can’t give birth naturally. With this being widespread knowledge, why wouldn’t an institution like the AKC ban these dogs that are unhealthy by nature? I know it’s a sensitive subject for lovers of those breeds, but it seems to me if you love the animal you’d want it to be happy and healthy. Obviously adopting flat faced dogs isn’t problematic, they’re already here and deserve a loving home, but I truly don’t understand why it hasn’t been regulated. Is it just a matter of people not caring enough, it being too difficult to put into place, etc? I’d like to know why &lt;em&gt;logistically&lt;/em&gt; they’re allowed to be bred that way, regardless of opinions or finding them cute. They’re objectively unwell and it bums me out!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
