I’ve pointed it out a few times, asking him to either watch where he’s peeing or clean it up. Everytime he says ok but I still see pee on the floor almost everytime I go to the bathroom. I’ve asked him to clean it after seeing the mess myself but he’ll insist there’s no way that’s his piss on the floor. I he thinks it’s water from washing his hands. But when I go wipe up the spot it’s always yellowish. Our floor is darker so it’s hard to tell but I assure you it’s piss and it’s always just in front of the toilet. If it was water from hand washing it would be on other spots of the floor too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m so tired of basically stepping on pee when I use the toilet. What am I supposed to do? I feel like I’m going crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
