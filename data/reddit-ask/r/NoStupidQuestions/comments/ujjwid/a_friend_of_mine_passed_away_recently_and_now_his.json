I want to be sure this isn&amp;#39;t some indication his account is going to be deleted? If it is, I just want to be sure I preserve the playlists he made. I can figure that part out unless anyone in the community has some advice on doing this. Sorry if this comes off like tech support or something dumb, I just haven&amp;#39;t found much through internet searches on the topic and want to gather the experience of this community if you guys have anything to input!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
