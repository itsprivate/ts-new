It always seems like wars get started by politicians to gain profit for a select few while they sacrifice the working people and suffer no ill consequences themselves. Often times for questionable reasons. It also seems that for some reason, these types of people have genetic deformities such as bone spurs that invalidate them from service... however there should be some &lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt; scrutiny in that sort of spurious diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I saw that this is on the line of a Rule 9 (disguised rant). So if you think that this is the case, feel free to delete. But I do genuinely want to hear opinions on this question&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
