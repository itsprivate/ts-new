When I first started watching porn years ago I remember enjoying watching men. But this oversexualing woman habit of porn industry fucked my brains sexual orientation. Now I masturbate to women and I can only get aroused watching a woman. I don’t enjoy watching men or get aroused by them like I used to, but I literally can get wet looking at a friends boobs, even faces of attractive girls I find extremely erotic sometimes and feel aroused. This is not something I enjoy because I am romantically heterosexual, I want to feel the lust I used to have for men again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My questions are:\nIs there anyone else with similar experiences? \nHow can I rewire my brain to feel like I used to. And do you know a more specific sub I can ask this to?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some people pointed out that the way I phrased the question might come as homophobic and I apologize for that. If I were also romantically into women I would never ask this, the problem here is not feeling the way I used to sexually about people I am into romantically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
