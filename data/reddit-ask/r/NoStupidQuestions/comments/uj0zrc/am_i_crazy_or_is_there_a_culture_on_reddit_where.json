I just find it super annoying when all I want to do is make a simple comment, possibly joking or sarcastic, and some 3rd party nobody decides to chime in with &amp;quot;I know you&amp;#39;re joking, but...&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;proceeds to give a 3 paragraph lecture to tell me why I&amp;#39;m wrong despite literally starting their comment by assuming I&amp;#39;m joking in the first place&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, cool bro. I would have vastly preferred if you didn&amp;#39;t do that, but thanks for that. I just delete my comment and block the person at that point, because it&amp;#39;s just not worth having to deal with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry, I know this is more of a rant than a stupid question. I guess I&amp;#39;m just seeking validation in my opinion, as I find this behavior insufferable... I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t let other people&amp;#39;s actions affect me, and for the most part, they don&amp;#39;t, but sometimes it&amp;#39;s just too obnoxious for me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
