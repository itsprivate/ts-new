However, I remember the two instances where I learn about sex. Once in primary school, where it talked about puperty, and once in class in secondary school where we went over safe sex, STD&amp;#39;s and all of that lovely stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, when it came to understanding how the male and female body was, I was clueless. I know the biology side relating to how the sperm and egg fertilise, but that was it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with regards to mistakes/ does and don&amp;#39;ts. I was clueless, still am to be fair. Especially that you should never blow into the vagina as it can be real bad. It&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve never done or thought of doing, but I can genuinely say my dumb ass in the moment could of potentially done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you have a more comprehensive Sex Ed education?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also do you agree about making it a full blow module in school. That&amp;#39;s has quizes, tests?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
