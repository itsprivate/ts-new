The thing is, it doesn’t so much check to see if I’m <em>human</em> as check to see if I’m <em>American.</em></p>\n\n<p>“Select all squares with crosswalks”</p>\n\n<p>“Select all squares with fire hydrants”</p>\n\n<p>“Select all squares with parking meters”</p>\n\n<p>These things do not exist in my country. I’ve heard of parking meters but I’ve never actually seen one and am not really sure what they look like. Fire hydrants show up in cartoons sometimes but I was under the impression they were red and round at the top - CAPTCHA has taught me they come in all different colours and shapes. Crosswalks I literally only learned about by doing CAPTCHA’s.</p>\n\n<p>You may be asking “what crazy underdeveloped third-world country are you from? Do you have to walk 10 miles to the nearest well to get water every day? Do you have to catch your own meals with spears and rocks?” Well, no. I’m just British.</p>\n\n<p><em>These things only exist in America.</em> Occasionally I’ll be asked to find a word I actually know, but even that is a trick. I’ll be asked to click all the buses, and find that I’m also expected to click on coaches, too. A coach is different to a bus, but I guess not in America. I’ll be asked to click all the traffic lights, of course I know what a traffic light is. Or do I? Because apparently in America “traffic light” means “yellow box.”</p>\n\n<p>It just seems bizarre. Of all the thousands of things that exist which have the <em>same</em> name and <em>look the same</em> in every country, why on earth do CAPCTHA tests seem to <em>exclusively</em> ask you to identify things that only apply to the United States?</p>\n\n<p>Is it to stop Chinese/Russian attacks on websites? Or is it just an infuriating coincidence?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
