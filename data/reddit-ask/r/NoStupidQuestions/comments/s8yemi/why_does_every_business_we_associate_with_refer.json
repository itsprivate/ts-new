My bank account changed my husband to primary owner after I added him onto it, after I had had the account for over 5 years. The insurance company we use and the place we got our car…every business we have interacted with basically treats my husband like he is the owner and provider even after I have made it clear I am the person to contact. They contact him INSTEAD of me. It really pisses me off because idk what else to think other than every business is sexist?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I specifically gave my contact info as the main contact info at every one of these institutions, besides being the main applicant and only person who has ever contacted them (and being the person who pays for rent and all the bills). This has happened in multiple states, so it is not just one area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband is perplexed as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
