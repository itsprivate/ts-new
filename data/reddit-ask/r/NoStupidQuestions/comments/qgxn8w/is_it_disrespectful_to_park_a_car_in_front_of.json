On any given day there are 3-4 cars in his driveway and 4-6 parked on the street. Several of these very rarely move. 2 days ago they parked a black p71 police interceptor infront of my house, I asked one of the residents of the house about it and he said the owner would move it when he returns from Arizona in a few days. (I live in Southern California btw). Parking has been an issue in my neighborhood for a long time due to these people. Am I being unreasonable here? I think taking up 5 street spots at a time and parking vehicles for days at a time in front of other people&#39;s homes is at least slightly disrespectful. I don&#39;t know</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
