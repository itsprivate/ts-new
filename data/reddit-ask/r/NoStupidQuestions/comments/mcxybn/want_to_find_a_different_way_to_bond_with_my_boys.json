I just enrolled them into baseball so they can have a camaraderie with other boys. Aside from every day provisions from a parent I have no clue what I’m doing. I have not much to bond with them over. I stay mostly physically, emotionally, and mentally drained. I don’t get real time with them. I thought, just a random idea, maybe I could learn how to do some gaming. It’s not taxing physically, mentally, or emotionally. The boys really enjoy their video gaming. \nIs this appropriate? Last game I played was Mario Brother’s. What could I play with them? \nIdeas, thoughts, and suggestions? I’d be grateful for them. TIA.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
