The first thing they ever had me do was front register and then, a few weeks later, they put me on drive thru register. So, it&amp;#39;s pretty much been my only designated station since I started. HOWEVER, I was never actually trained or taught how to identify fake money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I&amp;#39;m dropping money in the safe so I can leave, and one $20 won&amp;#39;t go through. My manager grabs me another $20 bill so my drop will be right, but says that she thinks it looks like a fake bill. Another crew member comes over and does something to look at it and says it&amp;#39;s real, so that&amp;#39;s good. But my manager made the comment that I&amp;#39;d have to pay it back if it was fake.....and this isn&amp;#39;t the first time this has happened, either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A while back another manager thought a $100 bill in my drawer was fake and it was this whole big deal that almost made me have an anxiety attack and, when I asked if $100 would come out of my check if it WAS fake, the manager just said she wasn&amp;#39;t sure....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So like, that&amp;#39;s not right, is it? Like, they can&amp;#39;t force me to pay back an amount of money for a fake bill they didn&amp;#39;t even teach me how to identify.....right? Sometimes they even seem surprised when I don&amp;#39;t know how to do so......like, am I supposed to just learn how to spot fake bills in my personal time, separate from work? It doesn&amp;#39;t feel right and I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;d do if they did make me pay, cause I don&amp;#39;t carry cash to replace in the register with....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
