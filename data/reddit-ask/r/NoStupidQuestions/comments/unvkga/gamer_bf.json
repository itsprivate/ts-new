My boyfriend (22) plays valorant with a random 14 year old girl. They&amp;#39;ve had a 2 hour call\non discord. Then she messages him few days later saying she&amp;#39;s bored and wants to call which he does and it was 5 mins long. Is this weird on my boyfriends part? I should also add that he planned to call me that night but I got upset with him (for other reasons) so he felt uncomfortable to call me. Yet he calls this 14 year old girl be she&amp;#39;s bored. I also don’t understand discord too but is it weird to be friends and call strangers on discord? I know I sound insecure and yeah I am lol but can someone pls tell me if that&amp;#39;s weird of him or not. He also got really defensive when I told him I thought it was weird, not sure if that’s worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tia :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
