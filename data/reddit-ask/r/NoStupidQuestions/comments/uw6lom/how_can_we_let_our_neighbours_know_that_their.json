  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have windows over our kitchen counter that face in their direction. The blinds on her window are normally shut, but when they&amp;#39;re not, we can see into her room. Our house is more elevated than theirs, so we can see quite a lot of the room too. She probably mostly sees our ceiling, so maybe that&amp;#39;s why she doesn&amp;#39;t seem to know how visible she is to us. The problem is that sometimes she gets dressed, or even dances in her underwear without closing the blinds while we&amp;#39;re prepping food. She&amp;#39;s in her early teens I guess, or possibly still a preteen. If it was me at that age, I would have wanted to know so I could make sure no one saw me while changing, but I would also die of embarrassment if I knew my neighbours had seen me naked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do we approach this with our neighbours in the best possible way? We don&amp;#39;t talk to them much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: it is not like this is happening very often, and most of the time the blinds are closed or she&amp;#39;s just there hanging around. The first time I assumed she just forgot, but there&amp;#39;s been like three or four times now so now I assume she&amp;#39;s just not aware. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a pedophile, and I&amp;#39;m not worried about what her parents would think of me, as there is no way they wouldn&amp;#39;t understand due to how close our houses are placed. The issue is about her and how she might react and feel if she knew that we have seen her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m female. It&amp;#39;s funny how everyone (myself included sometimes) assumes everyone else on Reddit is a male. My husband saw her once, and now he cooks food with his head down, staring intensely on the chopping board during the entire prep just in case. He doesn&amp;#39;t want to hang out in the kitchen other than what&amp;#39;s strictly necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
