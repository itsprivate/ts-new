I just don’t understand where it’s all gone.</p>\n\n<p>Also this was all also happening pre-covid, it’s not just due to lockdown &amp; as a frame of reference I’d say someone in the community made food to give out at least 2 times a month, with your neighbours thing would be shared like 3 weeks or so. You’d see family all the time and actually chat to them properly.</p>\n\n<p>I have a theory but may be wrong, increased costs of living with no real wage increase has caused us to work longer, thus causing worse moods + more tiredness resulting in just wanting wanting time to relax and to ourselves, but what do you guys think, am I being crazy?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
