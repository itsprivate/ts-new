We had a little party that day, and I remember when she entered the room there was a very strong (and unpleasant) smell. Me being a kid and meeting a pregnant woman for the first time, I assumed either that&#39;s just the way they smelt, or it was a coincidence. </p>\n\n<p>As I grew up I met very few pregnant woman face to face, I had a very isolated childhood, but I did notice that smell only appeared when I was in a crowded place, and frequently I would be able to spot a pregnant woman somewhere in the crowd, or a woman with a baby. </p>\n\n<p>I always assumed that the reason nobody mentioned it was because it would be rude, but as I&#39;ve gotten older I realize that I have never in my life heard anyone mention it. Not even an acknowledgment of the smell. This is strange to me considering it is a VERY strong smell. Virtually any room with a pregnant woman in it has smelt like that throughout, and considering its kind of a gross smell, I can&#39;t imagine EVERYONE staying silent about it.</p>\n\n<p>I brought it up to some friends recently, and they had no idea what I was talking about. This prompted me to Google it, I found nothing regarding this, many articles spoke of increased B.O but this smell is completely unique, not like B.O. </p>\n\n<p>I justified it as a coincidence until just a few days ago, I was in a Starbucks staring out the window, waiting for my drink. When I smelt the smell, I turned around and in the doorway was a pregnant woman. This confirmed it for me, I now have no uncertainty that all pregnant women smell like this. But NOBODY I&#39;ve spoken to can relate.</p>\n\n<p>I come to you Reddit, please tell me that my super power isn&#39;t to smell when someone is pregnant. Everybody&#39;s just being polite right?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
