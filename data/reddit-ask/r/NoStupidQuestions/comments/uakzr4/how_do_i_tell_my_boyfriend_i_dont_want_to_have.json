I know my boyfriend probably wouldn’t, but still. He’s just SO bad at sex. It’s genuinely embarrassing. I don’t know how to tell him this without him immediately dumping me. He has never given me an orgasm. He always just rolls over rips the condom off and gets it all over me once he’s done. I ALWAYS have to fake it. This is getting to be tiring. I love him, but he’s so embarrassingly poor in bed. And I have no way of talking to him about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
