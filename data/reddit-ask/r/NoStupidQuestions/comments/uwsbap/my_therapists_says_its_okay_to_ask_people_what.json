It makes me quite anxious, because I can&amp;#39;t really tell how I&amp;#39;m supposed to react to things, and sometimes that ends with me hurting people without meaning to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My therapist says it&amp;#39;s okay to just ask. Go &amp;quot;hey, I can&amp;#39;t really tell how you feel about this.&amp;quot; But in my experience people get kinda ticked off if they have to explain themselves, especially if it was a statement they just said in passing. They don&amp;#39;t like having to stop the conversation and spend time updating me. Sometimes people are already upset, and they get more upset when I &amp;quot;make more of [statement] than they meant with it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things just aren&amp;#39;t obvious or intuitive to me like they seem to be to everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you mind if people stop a conversation to ask more about what you meant/how you&amp;#39;re feeling about a thing, especially if it&amp;#39;s something you consider obvious? Please be honest. Sometimes people are like &amp;quot;omg, of course not!! i love and support my friends no matter what, it&amp;#39;s no bother!!&amp;quot; but it&amp;#39;s just in theory, and when I&amp;#39;m actually socially stupid they tell me to cut it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
