There isn’t many guys that work here so most of my coworkers are women. My girlfriend (24) says she doesn’t like the fact that I talk to them at work. I’ve mentioned in passing that sometimes we walk to the store or a restaurant and grab food and bring it back to the office together. She got super pissed. I have never flirted, cheated with them and never would, much less texted with them or hung out with them outside of work. It’s just that there isn’t anyone else to really joke with or talk to at work. I’ve reassured her all of this and asked for her trust and she insists that I stay away from them and now I’m questioning my own loyalty like maybe I am truly the bad guy in this situation. Am I in the wrong? Would appreciate any advice, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
