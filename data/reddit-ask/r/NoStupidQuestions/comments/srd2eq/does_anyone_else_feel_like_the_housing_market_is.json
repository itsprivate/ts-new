But now, after a decade of quantitative easing, they added FOMO to their toolbox: “You don’t want to miss out on these &lt;em&gt;low, low&lt;/em&gt; rates, they’ll probably &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be this low again!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve looked at properties and I’ve had realtors try to convince me to waive contingencies and inspections, making the FOMO argument on houses and condos that should’ve been burnt to the foundation and cleaned up by a hazmat crew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just seems too well timed. Particularly at a time when baby boomers are going on pensions and social security and trying to sell their turds of cookie cutter subdivision houses and condos that haven’t been renovated since the Reagan administration so they can buy mcmansions down in Boca or wherever boomers go to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there. The next time your realtor tells you to waive contingencies and asks how much of an escalator you’d like to add to an offer in case the property gets bid up above the listing price: remember how naive we were 15-20 years ago the last time they convinced us to take on life changing amounts of debt, and how well that’s worked out for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: They told us we’d be fools if we didn’t go to college, and many wound up degreed fools working entry level jobs with unforgivable debt.  Now they’re telling us to buy their old houses and fight each other for the right to take on even more debt, and  frankly it just feels like they’re trying to fool us twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
