I’d prefer to do the above over drinking in a bar. I play Xbox and love both modern and retro games. If I’m walking in the woods and I see a cool tree, I climb it, whether I’m alone or with friends/bf. I like fun silly dates. If I pass an empty playground and I’m with someone, I like swinging on swing sets and spinning on roundabouts til I wanna puke. These are things that bring me joy but I feel like I pretty much never see other people my age, and definitely never see people over 40, doing these things. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
