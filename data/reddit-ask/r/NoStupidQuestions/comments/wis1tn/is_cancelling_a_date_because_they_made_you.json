Although we got along really well over text and some phone calls, in real life it didn&amp;#39;t feel so good. Just &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;. No sparks. I&amp;#39;ve had sparks with men I had way less in common with or who were way less attractive than him. Weird. What really did it though, is our horrific makeout session. He kissed the way I remember my high school BF kissing. Aggressive tongue, no passion, lip nibbling, horrible. My mouth was being attacked. To top it off, he decided to feel for my butt like 10/15 seconds in?? I shooed it away. I felt quite disrespected. Nothing wrong with copping a feel, but it was our first date and first kiss. It was 4pm in a quiet part of the beach (no one within 100 feet). He did apologise but as he did so, he continued to hug me with both hands around my waist, it didn&amp;#39;t feel right. I tried to get over it, after all, he didn&amp;#39;t try again, but I&amp;#39;ve felt off about him since. Is being uncomfortable valid?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
