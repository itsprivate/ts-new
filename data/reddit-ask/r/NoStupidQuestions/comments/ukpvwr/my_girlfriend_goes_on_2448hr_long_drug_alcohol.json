  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll go out for drinks with my girlfriend, well have fun then she would generally want to stay out. At about 3-3:30am, I&amp;#39;ll go home to bed, I feel like that&amp;#39;s a solid night &amp;amp; she would choose to stay out because she doesn&amp;#39;t want the night to end. She&amp;#39;s already been drinking heaps of alcohol &amp;amp; taking lines to stay awake. She&amp;#39;ll end up with a group of 5-6 people kicking on at someone&amp;#39;s place &amp;amp; keep going to someone else&amp;#39;s place to continue taking lines, talking &amp;amp; drinking with 3 other guys until the afternoon or night the next day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did this last night, I didn&amp;#39;t want to go out but she did so I got changed, went out for a dance &amp;amp; made sure I had fun even though I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling like being out because I think that&amp;#39;s compromising in a relationship &amp;amp; want her to have the best time always, but she continued on to a bender. I told her I wouldn&amp;#39;t do that in a relationship &amp;amp; wasnt a fan of her doing it but she just went on with it &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;ve never been the one to force anything on anyone or stop them from doing that they want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a fan of this in a relationship at all, I would just never do that if she went home or wasnt coming with me. I&amp;#39;d have maybe a couple more drinks after she went &amp;amp; respectfully go home to my own place soon after if it was late. I&amp;#39;d go on a bender only if she was involved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I being uptight or wrong to feel off about it? Do I have grounds to not be okay with it even though I know nothing would ever happen? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note, we don&amp;#39;t live together, so when I go home I go back to my place when it&amp;#39;s late &amp;amp; she goes to hers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I trust her completely &amp;amp; have 100% confidence, zero doubts with her when she&amp;#39;s out. Like I&amp;#39;m genuinely glad she&amp;#39;s having fun but times when she&amp;#39;s needed to go home &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;ve wanted to stay out, I&amp;#39;ve gone home with her because I just wouldn&amp;#39;t do that to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
