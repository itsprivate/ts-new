They moved in unexpectedly because the mom lied and told the landlord that she fleeing a domestic violence situation with her boyfriend and that he stole all of her stuff. I knew it was a lie because he helped her move into this apartment even though she told the landlord she had no contact with him. Anyway, I can hear the kids crying and begging their parents for food on occasion and they are visibly dirty and unkept. I can also hear the mom verbally abusing the kids by calling them retards and bitches. I know they do drugs because there are constantly cars coming to this house at all hours of the night and they run out to grab something from them and run back in. Also, I’ve overheard conversations about their drug use. The landlord claims he’s trying to evict them due to non-payment of rent and he called CPS, but all the mom did was tell them lies, cleaned the house, and put them on nice clothes for the visit. CPS literally brought her bunk beds and mattresses because the kids were sleeping on the bare floor. Also, the kids barely to go to school because I hear them during school hours. How can they possibly hide all of this and CPS not notice???&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
