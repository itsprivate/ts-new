  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title says it all. My little brother (16)  got a samsung phone for his birthday by my dad. He had already asked him earlier what phone he wanted for\nhis birthday  to which he said &amp;quot;any of them will do&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;he doesn&amp;#39;t care&amp;quot;. So my dad bought him one of the latest Samsung and he seemed pretty happy and contented with it for a few days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However he seem to have totally changed recently when he came back from school saying how much a lot of (Not all of them! But majority) his friends and peers mock him for using an android device and how much &amp;#39;cringy&amp;#39; that green bubble is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he has been really sad these days demanding that his android phone be changed for an iphone.\nLet me tell you he isn&amp;#39;t a &amp;#39;spoilt brat&amp;#39; or anything, just a bit of an introvert.\n Neither he is a really much of a tech enthusiast.\nNo matter how many times I have tried to convince him that none of this matters and he shouldn&amp;#39;t fall prey to peer pressure but he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S IN NO WAY I AM SAYING OR IMPLYING THAT ANDROID IS BETTER IOS OR VICE VERSA. AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY ARE JUST DEVICES THAT ARE THERE FOR OUR COMFORT AND ARE TOTALLY SUBJECTIVE. BOTH OF THEM ARE GOOD IN THEIR OWN WAY.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
