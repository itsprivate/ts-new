High 700&amp;#39;s credit score, (unfortunately) small down payment, 30 year mortgage, comes out to around 3k a month.  Holy shit.  I don&amp;#39;t even make that much take home pay.  And it&amp;#39;s recommended to keep your mortgage under 1/3 of your net pay.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How the hell are people in my modest city making 9k a month.  118k a year.  And that&amp;#39;s for the AVERAGE home.  Which these average homes were getting insane bidding wars just a few months ago and getting bought for over asking price.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, dude.  If I google the average American income it&amp;#39;s like 31k.  or around 50-65k for a house hold.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This shit does not compute.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
