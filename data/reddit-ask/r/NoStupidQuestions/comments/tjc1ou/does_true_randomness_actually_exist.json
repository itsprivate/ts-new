It&amp;#39;s just that the outcome is obscured behind variables we aren&amp;#39;t aware of. If you knew the starting conditions and all the variables that went into that system you could perfectly predict the outcome of a coin flip every single time. To put this another way, if you &amp;quot;rewound&amp;quot; the flip and pressed &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; the outcome would remain unchanged (even if done a million times), because the starting conditions and variables are all the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the things we consider random (die roll, shuffled cards, roulette wheel, even the lottery) are not actually random, but events, that with enough information, could be predicted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our best attempts at making random functions in computers, are also not actually random. A company who built a form of security based on something they consider as close to actual random as we can get on a macro scale (wall of a bunch of lava lamps), is most likely using something we just can&amp;#39;t accurately predict over a long period of time (fluid dynamics) rather than actually being random.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at the smallest scale, at the quantum level, again it&amp;#39;s tempting to say there are &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; events. Like where a particle might land (essentially what the wave function is), but how likely is it that this is actually, truly &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; and again not just us assigning &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; out of our ignorance, being unable to know enough information about a given system to accurately predict the outcome (from what we can tell, we will never be able know enough given the Uncertainty Principle)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any known mechanisms in the natural world that could even produce something truly &amp;quot;random&amp;quot;? Something that is so random that if you were to &amp;quot;rewind&amp;quot; and hit &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; the same outcome is not guaranteed?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
