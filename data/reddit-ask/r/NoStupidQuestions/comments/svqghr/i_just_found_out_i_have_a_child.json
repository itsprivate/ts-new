My ex from about 5 years ago just contacted me and told me I have a child that is mine, who is autistic. I took a paternity test and found out the child is mine last night. I am devastated because this is all just so insane and feels like a nightmare. My current girlfriend I feel is truly the love of my life and we are supposed to move in together in April. We’ve talked about how neither of us would date somebody with a child because of how messy things are. I know I have to tell her but I almost feel like I shouldn’t, and just break things off because I don’t want her to have to make a tough decision or deal with any of this, I love her too much. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
