My first thought was to report it but that&amp;#39;s either really ruining someone&amp;#39;s life (if he&amp;#39;s not actually a pedo) or If they determine there&amp;#39;s nothing they can prosecute then it&amp;#39;s just drama for her so I want to be sure and asking here what we should do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She sent me a couple of a young girl in a towel, I asked her not to send me the worst ones but she said some are pretty much straight up porn, no males involved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should we do? Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit she said some were about 12 and &amp;quot;like penthouse&amp;quot; oof&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok it seems like it&amp;#39;s connected to an Amazon photos account, It&amp;#39;s the screensaver, it was set to memories. I&amp;#39;m trying to get her to find the email it&amp;#39;s connected to. I&amp;#39;m guessing that&amp;#39;s what the fbi would want&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit oh my God it&amp;#39;s connected to his wife&amp;#39;s account what the actual fuck&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
