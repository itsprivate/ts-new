We have 2 children our relationship is great everybody is happy life is good. The best way I can explain it is sex is just the very last thing on her priority list she doesn’t talk about sex nor does she ever masturbate, i don’t think it would bother her if it never happened again while the thought of sex is in my head quite often. I do not have a desire to cheat or risk losing what I have but I continuously have thoughts of what it must be like to have a partner that WANTS sex. I have expressed multiple times over and over that this is a problem for me but nothing has ever changed and I’ve just stopped trying all together and just masturbate when there’s an urge. It wasn’t always like this and I don’t know what I can do to change it or if there is anything I can do. What are my options here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
