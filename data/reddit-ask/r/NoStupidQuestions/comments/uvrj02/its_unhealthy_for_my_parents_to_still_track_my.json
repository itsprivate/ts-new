Since it&amp;#39;s midday, they assume I should be awake and start to panic. They want me to put life360 on my phone for their peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really dislike this idea. I don&amp;#39;t like life360. Occasionally, I spend the night at my bf&amp;#39;s apartment, and I know they&amp;#39;d make comments about that. I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of them tracking me. I moved out at 18 largely because they were very controlling. I love them and want to maintain a good relationship, I just want to know if this is something I should feel justified in putting my foot down on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
