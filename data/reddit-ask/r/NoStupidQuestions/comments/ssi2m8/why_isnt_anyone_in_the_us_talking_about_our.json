I haven’t been alive for more than 2 decades but I do know that in the 80s and 90s it wasn’t this bad and regular people actually somewhat stood a chance to compete with the market. Now it seems like a pipe dream to even come close to competing with them. Why isn’t anyone worried about the fact that our children will eventually not be able to successfully run a business because they’ll get strong armed by corporations every single time? I feel like either nobody is paying attention or the media is intentionally avoiding that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
