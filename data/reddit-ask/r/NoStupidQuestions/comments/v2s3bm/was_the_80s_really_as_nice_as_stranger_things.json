Like the way shows portray that time period, there was a much bigger sense of community, and people acted like humans. I don&amp;#39;t want to be like, &amp;quot;Oh wow I hate technology&amp;quot; because I actually love it, but I feel like maybe I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had such a hard time connecting with folk if I was born around then, if that makes sense? Because now it&amp;#39;s like, you can&amp;#39;t live without a phone. And I don&amp;#39;t really enjoy being glued to my screen 24/7. Most people my age seem like they&amp;#39;d rather stay in than go out and do things, and lately i&amp;#39;ve been the complete opposite, I always want to go and *do something* i just never quite know what that &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; is. It&amp;#39;s very aggravating.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
