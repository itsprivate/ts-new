FedEx doesn’t give the greatest updates, but is normally on time but sometimes not. UPS on the other is straight awful. More times than not it’s slow, and packages will linger in the same area for close to a day before they get moved. USPS and FedEx updates almost always have the package scanned with an update twice a day of it moving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time with UPS I had a package that was supposed to come to Nashville from Chicago and it went to Nebraska and then Idaho and then all the way back to Nashville. Like wtf? How the hell does that happen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else had this experience? I get packages pretty frequently and they almost always get here on time (as in it’s not too slow, most of the time within a reasonable period). Only time I ever had an issue with USPS is a package got stolen from the truck, but it was in a bad neighborhood where I was shipping it too. Luckily I had insurance and didn’t lose the money I had sold it for on eBay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
