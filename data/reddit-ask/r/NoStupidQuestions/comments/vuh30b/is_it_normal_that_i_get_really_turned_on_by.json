This isn&amp;#39;t a humble brag either, I have large areoles and my nipples aren&amp;#39;t always hard. Absolutely nothing wrong with that and I realize now that many people like this trait about me, but growing up I&amp;#39;ve had big insecurities about my breasts so it&amp;#39;s not that I&amp;#39;m obsessed with myself. Just when I&amp;#39;m alone by myself and I notice my breasts and nipples, it instantly turns me on. Is this normal?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
