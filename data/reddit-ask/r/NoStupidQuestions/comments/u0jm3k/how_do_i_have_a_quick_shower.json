And guess what I still feel clean! Ughh feel so much better now. But now my clothes against my skin are driving me mad….. but that’s another issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I shortened my overall time by stripping in my room and only taking in what I need EG towels, so there’s less to faff with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I played a song and tried to shower before it was over. I kept telling myself I don’t need to rinse until the end of my shower (rather than after every little thing I do). I think my meds are helping a bit because I was able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t bother shaving at all today, can do that next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone for the understanding and suggestions. ♡&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
