Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I&amp;#39;m really curious why people aren&amp;#39;t fucking pissed at those in power. What&amp;#39;s the deal?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
