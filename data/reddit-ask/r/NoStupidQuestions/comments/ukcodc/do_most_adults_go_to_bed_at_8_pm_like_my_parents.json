My parents (moreso my dad) goes to bed at 8 p.m. and gets up at 4 a.m. because he starts work at 6 a.m. I know that&amp;#39;s really early and so him going to bed when he does makes sense. My mom goes to bed later than him but gets up at the same time because my dad makes a lot of noise when he wakes up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have this thought process that most adults go to bed that early and then in turn get up really early as well. I have never seen any comments proving this so I thought I would ask. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
