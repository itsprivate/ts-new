I really don’t want to give up Reddit altogether—it’s a source of goodness and inspiration and escape in my life. But the targeted ad algorithms have no idea that my “interests” are the exact things that are giving me daily anxiety attacks. Surely this isn’t an uncommon experience. How can I make it stop?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
