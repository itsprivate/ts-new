We&amp;#39;ve started making jokes about wanting another couple as roommates. We&amp;#39;ll ask our close friends to move in with us and then sternly say &amp;quot;Nothing sexual!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s become a joke in my friend group but I&amp;#39;m wondering why people don&amp;#39;t do this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A 4 income household with shared expenses would be a huge advantage. You&amp;#39;d have plenty of people to hang out with. Chores could be divided into smaller portions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than getting sick of each other (happens with all roommates), I can&amp;#39;t see a reason why not. Assuming the 4 of you could afford a big enough house for personal space, why wouldn&amp;#39;t you? Why does a family have to stop at two adults?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it just tradition? Are there people out there who&amp;#39;ve done this? What&amp;#39;s been your experience?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here&amp;#39;s the article that made me start seriously considering it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/\"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I get it guys. I&amp;#39;m in a unique position. Privacy is not a concern of mine and I&amp;#39;m not talking about strangers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanna hang with my best friend and his wife and have help with the chores.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
