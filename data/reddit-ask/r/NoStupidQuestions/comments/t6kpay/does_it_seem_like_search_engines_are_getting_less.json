I am just trying to gauge if this is true or something I am imagining. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, earlier, I typed in &amp;quot;Best Bose products of all time&amp;quot; into duck duck go. Pretty much every result was &amp;quot;best bose speakers of 2022&amp;quot; or some similar return result and of those results, pretty much the entire first few pages were nothing but amazon affiliate links and &amp;quot;reviews&amp;quot; that are nothing more than shallow advertisements for clicks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured maybe it was just because duck duck go, so I did the same search in google. Of the google results, only 1 return really matched my search on the first page &amp;quot;the best bose speakers of all time 1972-2022. All the rest were similar &amp;quot;best of 2022&amp;quot; affiliate pages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been using the internet since the mid-90s and it just seems like in the early-mid 00s when I searched something I found more objective, quality websites you would want to read. Now it seems like it returns nothing but ads.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
