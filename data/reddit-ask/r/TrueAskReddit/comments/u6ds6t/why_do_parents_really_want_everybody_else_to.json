  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m talking about the US if this isn&amp;#39;t a universal thing. I&amp;#39;ve seen this with a lot of my friends who become parents. Once it happens, they become much more vocal about how everyone our age should become parents, and how it&amp;#39;s the most rewarding thing and how there be another purpose in life besides having children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read posts on Reddit where people are more candid I think. And still there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who discuss the shift in mindset. The &amp;quot;I would have given up long ago, but I keep showing up to my crappy job so that my kids can have a life and get to college&amp;quot; type vibes that are plentiful on here. Lots of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve given up any semblance of free time, personal enrichment, and the ability to take career/business risks&amp;quot; type sentiments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, this seems like an extraordinarily unappealing way to live life. You&amp;#39;re kind of resigning your life to cease to have much personal fulfillment outside of child rearing at the age of like 30. And this is seen as normal, and a default path, and many parents seem to get outright mad if you say you don&amp;#39;t want to do it. I don&amp;#39;t want to say &amp;quot;misery loves company&amp;quot; because that&amp;#39;s assigning too much intent behind it. But at the very least, the kind of sales tactics that parents try to use to get me to become a parent seem very similar to me like an Amway or MLM salesperson (I&amp;#39;ve been approached by them).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just to get slightly political, many of the loudest &amp;quot;You should get married and have kids!&amp;quot; proponents seem to be right wing, just anecdotally for my life. They usually fall into the camp of &amp;quot;I have no responsibility to society, taxes should be low or non existent, don&amp;#39;t make me pay for anyone else, I have no responsibility to the collective&amp;quot;. Yet when they talk about motivations for having children, I hear things like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m doing my part to keep the next generation going&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Someone&amp;#39;s gotta do it for the future, it&amp;#39;s just what you do&amp;quot;, which to me seem like suspiciously collective sounding arguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve really thought a lot about it, and it seems a little suspicious. What makes new parents become sudden evangelists for parenthood, sometimes using what I would call MLM style logic to try to get more people into having kids?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
