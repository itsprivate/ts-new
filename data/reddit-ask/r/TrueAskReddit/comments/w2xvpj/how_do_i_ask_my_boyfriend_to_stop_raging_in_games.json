The only issue is, that he rages relatively frequently, wich includes banging on his table. I don&amp;#39;t mind the rest, but since I was regularly physically abused (he knows this), the sound of him beating the table really scares me and I almost start crying every time he does it. \nI don&amp;#39;t want him to stop gaming or pit limits on him, so I wanna know how I could bring this up without me feeling like I&amp;#39;m putting a leash on him. I have no doubts that ge&amp;#39;d stop immediately if I told him, I just don&amp;#39;t know how to bring it up...\nThanks in advance for your help&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
