As a citizen in a 3rd world country, politicians &amp;quot;eliminating&amp;quot; competitions before, during and after elections is so common like a morning coffee.Its also possible even duringnthe their term. Lots of times, its obvious that Person A killed or at least got something to do with Person B but still win and everything goes back to normal after few media outrage. With the superiority of American military, Im pretty sure most of them can hire someone to do a clean hit. With their current media situation and cancel culture, with enough funds, they can easily manipulate the media to sway the blame away from them. Do they have a moral compass? lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
