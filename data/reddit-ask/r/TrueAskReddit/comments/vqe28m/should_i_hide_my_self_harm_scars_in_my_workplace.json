I have scars on my wrists that have been healed for years but were bad enough that they are white/raised/still visible. I have accepted my scars and am no longer ashamed of them and to be honest I often forget that I even have them. However, I now work at a corporate law firm and since it is quite a conservative environment, I have been way more conscious about what I wear/how i look. My question is - is it &amp;quot;unprofessional&amp;quot; to show self harm scars? Should I cover them up?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
