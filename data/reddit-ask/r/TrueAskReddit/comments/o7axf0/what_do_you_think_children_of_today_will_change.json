Corporal punishment, for example, used to be the norm, and most parents practiced it without any hesitation. Over time, corporal punishment has become more and more taboo due to future generations creating awareness over it’s negative psychological effects on children. Fathers used to be more distant towards their children in the past, but future generations have fought to have the opposite relationship with their own children, since a lot of them felt that they missed out on having a nurturing father in their own lives. On this sub, there are many posts about parents who strive to undo the social or cultural conditionings that were imposed on them by their own parents due to the harm it caused them, even if their parents found the behavior to be  innocent. What are some things that the generation of your children will look back on and deem archaic or narrow minded? Do you think they will have any of those “when I was you age, I had to put up with xyz” stories? What do you think might make them reflect and say “my parents did this, but when I have children, I will never do the same”? Is it possible to know ahead of time what parenting techniques might become outdated?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
