It got me thinking about myself, and how I literally have no culture to speak of.  I was born in the US and have a pretty generic name.  I&amp;#39;m white as a ghost and I don&amp;#39;t really know anything about my cultural roots, and I have never been religious.  It was interesting watching these shows about how many people come together over one significant cultural theme, either by nationality or religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, outside of my very small family, I don&amp;#39;t really have any other family or friends that I really associate with.  I can&amp;#39;t imagine what it would be like to have a ton of people that share your national heritage or religion.  To me I don&amp;#39;t think it matters, as I really don&amp;#39;t like to attach labels on myself.  I don&amp;#39;t really understand the feeling of wanting to know your ancestry or where you are from, as if that defines you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is a question that could truly be answered, but I&amp;#39;d like to get some responses if I can.  What does it feel like belonging to a culture?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
