Plant blindness aside, people are extremely disconnected from where their food comes from. I&amp;#39;m currently getting a graduate degree in horticulture and have had several jobs in the field. Working on a research farm was one of my favorites. Gave me great insight into what goes into growing crops such as corn, cotton, peanut, soybean, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like people don&amp;#39;t understand the challenges of agriculture and what it takes to feed a growing population. So many people have uneducated and even harmful opinions about agriculture, especially GMOs. I tried explaining to someone on &lt;a href=\"/r/science\"&gt;r/science&lt;/a&gt; that most farmers do in fact care about the environment but they really have to use chemical control to avoid yield reduction or crop loss. A lot of people didn&amp;#39;t like that. Trust me I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of chemical control either, but it has a time and place. Anyone who has tried to grow strictly organically may understand what I&amp;#39;m talking about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry to rant but I want to know what field you may work in or have expertise in that people just don&amp;#39;t understand or have never interacted with. How does this affect their opinions or society at large?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
