There&amp;#39;s nothing special or unique about what they do, they seem to have won the lottery and became famous superstars. They&amp;#39;re the ones making a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often, I stumble across some well researched and insightful content but they&amp;#39;re nowhere near as popular. These content creators make a couple of dollars rather than thousands. I wonder why more people are not looking or reading these kinds of work. There&amp;#39;s so much more passion poured into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find interesting Twitch streams where I&amp;#39;m the only viewer. Documentary quality and lengthy YouTube videos which have less than a thousand views. Or perhaps a blogger that celebrates 100 unique views per month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more popular content tends to be from popularizers who have a blog about their normal views taken from a cellphone camera. Plenty of make up artists who are sponsored by expensive cosmetic products showing the same tips that hundreds of others people have purported.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowingly, there is a big survivorship bias playing a role here, but I have the impression that there&amp;#39;s more to it than that. I value quality but it&amp;#39;s hard to find because the popular stuff takes over the first results page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
