  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can understand intellectually about how humanity has evolved to a point where average every day life for someone in a developed Western culture can be counterproductive to both physical and mental health. I can understand how we&amp;#39;ve lost touch with nature, and don&amp;#39;t move around as much. I get why we need to exercise and how fulfilling it is to go to a National Park and hike and exert yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling that there&amp;#39;s really something funny about it. It reminds me of the story about how Michael Jackson was so famous that he couldn&amp;#39;t go out in public. And he paid a crowd of people to pretend to shop in a grocery store, so he could shop in the grocery store and feel like a normal person. Whenever that comes up in &lt;a href=\"/r/todayilearned\"&gt;/r/todayilearned&lt;/a&gt;, the comments always talk about how sad and eerie that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of feel the same way whenever I drive my 21st century miracle automobile to a nature preserve, and get out, and start walking. Not like my ancestors, because I&amp;#39;m getting water, or following a hunt, or walking to my farm with fertile soil, or going to a city center to sell my wares. But because we&amp;#39;ve become so efficient at doing what those activities are meant for. An efficiency that they would probably kill for. And I need to temporarily forsake that efficiency to cosplay as someone who needs to be exerting this extra effort, or else it won&amp;#39;t be good for my health. In those moments, I feel like regular people pitying Michael Jackson at the supermarket, except at myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it weird to feel this way? Isn&amp;#39;t it oddly weird that for countless generations, they&amp;#39;ve been struggling to make things easier, and all of us happen to be born literally within about a generation or two where we&amp;#39;ve made things so easy that it&amp;#39;s actually not good for us?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
