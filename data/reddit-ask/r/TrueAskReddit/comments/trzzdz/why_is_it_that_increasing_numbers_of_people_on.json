I quickly became uncomfortable being there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason is that the other users appeared to live in a tiny bubble. Their opinions on most real-world matters were just parroting what some YouTubers had to say on the subject. Their knowledge of pop culture was pretty much limited to the cartoons of their youth and that one Steam game they spent a thousand hours playing. They didn&amp;#39;t seem to read books at all except a comic or two, which would be forgivable if &lt;em&gt;the server wasn&amp;#39;t about writing fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quit the server due to my uncomfortableness and didn&amp;#39;t have to deal with that kind of person for a while. But soon enough, on any website that wasn&amp;#39;t ridiculously toxic, every blogger or forumgoer that I encountered fit that archetype, with the added irritation of treating every form of contact like a debate, delivering an overly long response when anyone asks a simple question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is the internet at the point where even the &lt;em&gt;good people&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;#39;t feel like they have ever had a real-life conversation? The reason I joined Reddit, among other websites, was that I had faced a huge setback that had cut me off from meeting people day-to-day, and being on the internet was a good substitute at the time. Now it&amp;#39;s full of people who I genuinely don&amp;#39;t know how to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
