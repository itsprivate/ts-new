Or has it really always been this bad and we just never realized it? I mean for a period of time there were a lot of pro-worker actions in the U.S. from the 1880s really up until the Cold War, and since America built a lot of shit, had a lot of jobs, they ended up benefitting massively. During WW2 most Americans were working for the government, either through companies working on building much needed war supplies, or directly through the military. There is one problem with it though, it’s the same thing Germany was doing, the same thing the Soviets were doing, the same thing basically every country who was in the war was doing. Post-War though through stuff like the GI-Bill, a large amount of American soldiers were leaving with chances at higher education, and were able to afford a large amount of children, thus the baby boom. America’s prosperity in the 50s and 60s was due in large part to the Government, and not really the large private corporations that dominate America today, and once the Cold War started America slowly, but surely drifted away from these values. Or does this fear to innovate its economic structure in America go much deeper? With stuff like slavery, the ultimate wealth inequality, or even the first age old statement of “no taxation without representation” showing a reluctant stubbornness and fear of the government power? Is America the way it is because, at its roots, it’s always been this way?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
