Or even more impossible for me to understand, WANT to work? Like having a passion, a dream or stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does it feel to take the fact you will marry and have kids as a given? (meaning that many people are more worried about when they will start a family not if it is possible or not)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does it feel to take for granted that you will get old, and Im not talking about 80yo, just 30/35yo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I truly, Truly do not understand when people say that a 50yo person died too soon, even in my most wild and optimistic fantasies I dont see myself getting past 27yo, and that is already borderline sci-fi fiction to get so much old in my head).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My only friend when we talk about this stuff always ends up saying &amp;quot;I just dont understand you&amp;quot;, well I also do not understand him, can you guys help? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I truly do not know what to expect, its silly to expect to understand such a concept as to &amp;quot;why do people live&amp;quot; on the internet, but I talked with many many people online and irl and none of them had a single thing to say to me that made sense, all they had was &amp;quot;I dont understand you...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured I might as well try here, have a good day everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
