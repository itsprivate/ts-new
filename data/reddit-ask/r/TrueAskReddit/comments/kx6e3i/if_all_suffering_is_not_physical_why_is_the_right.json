There are ongoing discussions around the right to die in terms of euthanasia and suicide as well. I believe that people who have mental illness or have experienced trauma they are unable to live with should be allowed to end their lives-- why is this is a problematic view? I understand that a lot of the right to die literature discusses rational suicide and the concept of making informed rational decisions. But we are depriving people of their reality if we claim that mental illness distorts reality--  it does impact their reality, that is precisely the point. We all have our own realities and for some it is more painful that others. That does not make it less real or rational though.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, some people experience systemic barriers that really diminish their quality of lives and makes things unbearable. Why are those cases left out of consideration?</p>\n\n<p>To be clear I am talking about &quot;while I appreciate and love life, it has been too painful for too long and I have tried several methods to improve things but it has not helped. So I have to leave&quot; vs &quot;I am in pain right now so I must die even though it has not been a long term experience&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
