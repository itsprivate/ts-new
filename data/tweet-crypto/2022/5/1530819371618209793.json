Remember that S2F model was created in March 2019, when bitcoin was below $4K. IMO the correctly predicted 14X rise (55/4) is worth more than the 2X prediction error (100/55). https://t.co/9Qb44uk9k1",

The bad news: $100K was probably too high. The good news: model still points to $500K after 2024 halving. https://t.co/O9kCC2In5j",
