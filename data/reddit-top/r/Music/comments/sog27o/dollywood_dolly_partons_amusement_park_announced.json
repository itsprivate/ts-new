(WZTV) — Dollywood on Tuesday announced they&amp;#39;ll start paying a hundred percent of tuition for employees who wish to further their education. This includes the cost of fees and textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The education benefit package is available to all team members on the first day of their employment. The company says it&amp;#39;s a way for employees at all levels to pursue their personal and professional dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Piloted by Dolly Parton&amp;#39;s operating partner Herschend Enterprises, the program from GROW U. will mark a significant investment for workers. President of Dollywood Company Eugene Naughton says it&amp;#39;s an opportunity for employees to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One of The Dollywood Foundation’s key tenets is to ‘learn more.’ This program is created with that very tenet in mind. We want our hosts to develop themselves through advanced learning to fulfill the foundation’s other tenets: care more, dream more, and be more.&amp;quot;\nThe program will officially launch Feb. 24 for all seasonal, part-time, and full-time employees at Dollywood Parks &amp;amp; Resorts. Hosts can enroll in the program on their first day of employment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When our hosts strive to grow themselves, it makes our business and our community a truly better place,&amp;quot; Naughton said. &amp;quot;We care about our hosts’ development and we want their future to grow because of love—not loans.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
