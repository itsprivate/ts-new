Despite it only being a couple of days, I&#39;ve been lurking here for a bit. The amount of 6 figure, 7 figure, and 8 figure gains I was seeing was blowing my mind. More than that, it was blowing my mind that nobody was selling. I thought, &quot;you made a 7 figure profit, what more do you want?&quot; Now that I&#39;m all in, I&#39;ve been staying more up to date with the things that are happening. And now I get it. I understand why nobody is selling. </p>\n\n<p>I just saw a video of a billionaire saying it&#39;s unfair what&#39;s going on. I saw a billionaire say, &quot;he&#39;s just trying to make a living&quot;. I saw an article call WSB an alt-right hate group. I havent seen one billionaire against this movement speak on the recession of 2008. But I have seen stories in WSB of families deteriorating by the days because of the recession. I&#39;ve seen blatant market manipulation to keep the common man from trading. I&#39;ve seen countless slanders and whining over the last couple of weeks.</p>\n\n<p>You know what else I&#39;ve seen during this time? I saw a guy on here donate switches to St. Jude. I saw a different guy donate money to St. Jude. I saw a guy pay for his dogs surgery. I saw a dude pay off his student loans. I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I&#39;ve seen somebody be able to buy a place after living in their car. </p>\n\n<p>This is all so much bigger than money. That&#39;s cliche as fuck, but God it&#39;s true. I&#39;m stuck between my blood boiling and my eyes watering. Honestly, I don&#39;t have a huge investment into Gamestop. Its not like my shares alone hold any bearing on Melvin making this out alive or not - but it&#39;s all I have. I went from freaking out over losing $100 in a day, to losing thousands in a day and just kinda smirking. </p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I planned on getting out if it hit $1000. But IM NOT GETTING OUT. Truthfully, I&#39;ll survive without this money if it tanks. Obviously money would be nice, but I know some others out there probably need it more. All that I do ask, if you do make it out of this not holding the bag, please do something good with your profits. Please don&#39;t turn into the greedy leeches on wall street. </p>\n\n<p>tl;dr - I like this stock. I like you all. Big like, no sell</p>\n\n<p>Edit: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 can we cook tendies out on Saturn or do we need to bring our own?</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Stop messaging me asking for financial advice I&#39;m a retard and I&#39;m not giving any advice I just like the stock</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: If anybody messages you for financial advice I&#39;d ignore it. 80% of the messages are worded very similarly and are asked by low karma accounts. Starting to think these are bots messaging us for financial advice to fuck us over</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
