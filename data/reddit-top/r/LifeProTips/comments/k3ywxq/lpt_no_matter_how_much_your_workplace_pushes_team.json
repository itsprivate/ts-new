It&#39;s kind of vindicating but also sad that so many people feel the same or have had similar negative experiences. For the &quot;my workplace isn&#39;t like this&quot; and &quot;my co-workers are my family&quot; people - I hope it stays that way for you, I really do, but I&#39;d maybe read some of the stories on this comment thread and be wary. It&#39;s better to be safe than sorry right?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
