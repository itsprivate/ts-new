If TSLA losses in value they buy more and if it gains more they sell it. They maintain a certain % of portfolio value. TSLA when in losing streak and they buy more to maintain the holding ratio.  As long as ARK doesnt increase the ratio of stock value in portfolio they&#39;re not adding any new positions - so following daily trade from ARK needs further analysis. </p>\n\n<p>ARK is always be trimming or compensating gains and losses so no one position eats up their most part of ETF value.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
