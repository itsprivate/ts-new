My current largest position is into $OUST. Lidar stocks haven’t had the best run over the last couple of months in the market, but I truly believe the tech will be essential in the future as EV’s and AV’s become more widely adopted. $OUST is building an extremely promising and dedicated team with the recent acquisition of Sense Photonics. They just added the CEO of Mercedes-Benz Trucks, Karin Rådström, to their board of directors, and they’re currently the only publicly traded company offering digital lidar instead of analog lidar like their competitors. Digital lidar has many more applications than just auto as well and will allow for lower manufacturing costs, more scalability, and more widespread use of the tech in my opinion. Does anyone else have an opinion on the future of lidar stocks? I personally believe $OUST will be a top dog in the lidar space, but I’m curious to know y’alls thoughts on other publicly traded lidar companies (Ex. $AEVA, $LAZR, $LIDR, $VLDR, $MVIS, and $INVS)\n\nEdit: Definitely plan on continuing to hold $OUST for at least another couple of years. They already have almost 600 established customers, their digital lidar is best in class, and they focus far more on the industrial uses of lidar than the automotive uses. If they come anywhere close to their projected sales by 2025, this stock will see pretty large gains.",
