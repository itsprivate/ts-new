Now something like this isn&#39;t really enough to cause a major crash but the real danger is how deep these firms are in the red when their lenders are forced to pay their client&#39;s mistake to GemE shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>If the lenders(usually giant investing firms and banks) somehow don&#39;t have the liquid capital to close out their borrower&#39;s positions, then we&#39;ll see the dominos start falling as they too start liquidating their own stock positions which then causes a even bigger sell off.</p>\n\n<p>But we&#39;re not done just yet. What if GemE reaches such an absurd price that results in the huge institutions and banks to owe more money than their entire networth? This is what happened in 2008 and this is what the elites are scared of.</p>\n\n<p>I seriously see this all playing out and GemE hitting a ludicrous price in the thousands. The government will be forced again to bailout the incompetent and that bailout money will go directly to you, the shareholder. The domino effect on the economy of multiple hedge funds crashing down, liquidating their other stock positions, causing more pressure on the market etc. is very real.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
