You can always add more later, and people saying that buying the dip will help you get back even quicker are probably correct.\n\nThat said, I was right about a few things myself. I correctly predicted that the bull market was unsustainable and that the end of QE would be the end of the rally.  I also predicted that QE and the high valuations it causes leave us very vulnerable to shocks and black swan events - ie the war in Ukraine and inflation.  Some people might reply here \"well duh\", but that's not the case.

Still, it seems our tendency is to always jump to the conclusion that any conflicting opinions are nonsense or garbage.  I don't think this is always the case.  I think people always have a reason to believe what they do, and if we all learned a bit of humility we might be able to learn from them.  I think that makes us better investors, and as cheesy as it may sound, better people, too.\n\nI have a bad feeling that I will receive the normal hate on this post, or even that it will be removed for being off topic.  That would be a shame.  Ray Dalio talked about how important it is, in his experience, to share ideas and opinions with others in order to try to figure out any blind spots.  And I think he's a pretty good investor.\n\nPS: This doesn't just happen here, it's unfortunately a bad human trait that is made even worse by the anonymity of the internet.
