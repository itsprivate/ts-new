We&#39;ve seen big moves out of the airlines and cruise companies, but I personally feel that Coca-Cola is a stronger re-opening play than either of those.</p>\n\n<p>KO is trading at just under $51 as of today&#39;s close, down from its pre-COVID high of $60 last year. The company was hit hard by their consumers being stuck at home for months, unable to dine out and attend sporting events or concerts. Revenue and earnings were down in 2020, and even with vaccines coming out it may still be a while until they return to 2019 levels.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, Coca-Cola took steps to re-organize their business to become more efficient in order to respond to the pandemic. I think that they can emerge from the pandemic as a more focused business, and once top-line revenues catch back up the company could really see some improvements in their earnings.</p>\n\n<p>Their CEO touched on some of these aspects in their earnings call back in February:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://equisolve-private.s3.amazonaws.com/cocacolacompany/db/764/7664/file/CORRECTED%20TRANSCRIPT_%20The%20Coca-Cola%20Co.%28KO-US%29%2C%20Q4%202020%20Earnings%20Call%2C%2010-February-2021%208_30%20AM%20ET.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVOH5SHIJOSUYOLRZ&amp;Expires=1615332187&amp;Signature=oPMiBI1hM9jbiC2m%2FNpNed8vwfU%3D\">https://equisolve-private.s3.amazonaws.com/cocacolacompany/db/764/7664/file/CORRECTED%20TRANSCRIPT_%20The%20Coca-Cola%20Co.%28KO-US%29%2C%20Q4%202020%20Earnings%20Call%2C%2010-February-2021%208_30%20AM%20ET.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVOH5SHIJOSUYOLRZ&amp;Expires=1615332187&amp;Signature=oPMiBI1hM9jbiC2m%2FNpNed8vwfU%3D</a></p>\n\n<p>Even with the headwinds they faced in the past year, KO still managed to increase their annual dividend to $1.64, their 39th consecutive annual increase. Of all of the so-called &quot;reopening plays,&quot; I feel like KO has not had a huge bounce due to changing investor sentiment. For example, cruise lines like Carnival are issuing new shares just to stay afloat (literally), and are months away from even being able to receive passengers. Yet investors have already pumped their shares 30% in the past month. I understand that KO is only 16% below their pre-COVID high so I&#39;m not expecting a 25% run up out of them in the next month or anything. I&#39;m just surprised that more people don&#39;t seem to be getting behind this name. With restrictions being lifted across the country, the amount of Coke products that will be bought at convenience stores, restaurants, and arenas will start to pick up. There&#39;s a pent-up demand for people to get out of the house, but not everyone is financially able to book a cruise or plane ticket right now. However, almost anyone can celebrate by taking their family to the local pizzeria or taco place and washing their meal down with a Coke or Sprite. There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC alone that will be increasing their orders for both flavor syrup and bottled drinks now that indoor dining is returning.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, my plan at the moment is to use a small portion of my portfolio (~10%) to scoop some shares on the next drop to $50 or below. This would be at least a year hold, to collect the dividend income along with hopefully $5-10 in gains per share. About 70% of my portfolio is loaded to the tits with PLTR (300 @ 32 lol), IPOE, PSTH, and some biotech, so on the recent dip I&#39;ve been thinking about adding some value plays like KO or COST.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to post a Discussion here rather than go the DD route because I&#39;m not 100% sold on this play myself. If you have any opinions about KO (good or bad) please share! I&#39;m obviously not worried that the stock is gonna tank 50% or anything, but my main fear is that it could trade sideways between $48 and $52 for the next 6 months, and if tech finds some more room to run I&#39;d hate to miss out on those gains.</p>\n\n<p>Is KO a good re-opening play? Are there better value plays out there rn? Can tech keep running after this correction? I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice and I have no shares of KO at the present time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
