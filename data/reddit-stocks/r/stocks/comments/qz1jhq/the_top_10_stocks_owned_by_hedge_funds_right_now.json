Citi just put out a list of the top 10 stocks held by the biggest 50 hedge funds as of the end of Q3. I can't say the list is surprising, but it is interesting to see. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Name|Number of funds holding as top 10 position in size|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|MSFT|Microsoft|26|\n|GOOGL|Google|17|\n|AMZN|Amazon|17|\n|FB|Facebook|15|\n|AAPL|Apple|9|\n|NFLX|Netflix|9|\n|CRM|Salesforce|6|\n|BKNG|Booking Holdings|5|\n|DASH|Doordash|5|\n|MA|Mastercard|5|\n\nIt's noteworthy that just because hedge funds own these stock, that doesn't mean they are completely bullish on them in the near term. It's very possible they are running shorts in the various forms (covered calls, puts, etc) against their own holdings to hedge themselves. \n\n**The only thing that stuck out to me here is BKNG**, which seems  overvalued, given it is trading at a price that is well above pre-pandemic levels and a P/E for this year over 55. Earnings are projected to grow at 130% next year.  That means the company would have about $100 per share in earnings. BKNG has traded very richly for some time, so applying a healthy 25X multiple on earnings, that would project a stock price of $2500 next year. In this market, a p/e of 25 looks pretty low, especially if the company continues to grow revenues quickly.\n\n**Sales for Q3 came in just under $4.7B**, which puts it on pace to exceed 2019 revenues of $15B in 2022 IF the trajectory continues. \n\nBKNG sold off big after its last earnings report, despite the fact they delivered a healthy beat of expectations. The drop is presumably because expectations had grown too high in advance of earnings, on concerns that COVID would impact travel, and on profit taking.  It's now down over 300 points from its high. \n\nIt's interesting to see the trend reversal that just occurred in the travel sector. AirBnB, BKNG, and Expedia, were all up double digits from mid-August and in the past 10 days, all 3 are down. \n\nAttractive entry point for BKNG?\n\nIt could be, but I'm betting the stock will retreat further as COVID cases rise due to holiday travels.  I'll be looking to buy the stock if it dips back to 2,100 again.",
