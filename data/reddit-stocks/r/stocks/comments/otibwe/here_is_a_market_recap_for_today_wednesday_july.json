  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 28, 2021**\n\nThe market staged another remarkable reversal today, with many names that were hit yesterday clawing back their losses. The three major indexes were mixed, with Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.35%. The S&P 500 (SPY) dipped towards the end of the session to close 0.6%  down. The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.\n\nToday, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. \n\nMoreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The statement read, “Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.” In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. \n\nOn inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, “Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses” and “The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.”\n\nHowever, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nShares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nImportantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects “year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the “Shop Module” that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. \n* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.\n* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. It’s funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesn’t spend billions to produce and acquire content. \n* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel. As I’ve said before, I think AMD and NVDA are the kings of this space.\n* Chinese stocks gapped up today after a massive, across the board sell-off. \n* Microsoft (MSFT) earnings Yesterday\n   * **Revenue:** $46.15 billion versus $44.25 billion expected\n   * **Earnings per share:** $2.17 versus $1.92 expected\n   * **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.69 billion versus $13.9 billion expected\n   * **Intelligent Cloud:** $17.38 billion versus $16.4 billion expected\n   * **More Personal Computing:** $14.09 billion versus $13.8 billion expected\n* Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) earnings yesterday\n   * **Earnings per share (EPS):** $27.26 vs $19.34 per share\n   * **Revenue:** $61.88 billion vs $56.16 billion\n   * **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.00 billion vs $6.37 billion expected\n   * **Google Cloud revenue:** $4.63 billion vs $4.40 billion expected, \n   * **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $10.93 billion vs $9.74 billion expected\n* Apple (AAPL) earnings yesterday\n   * **EPS**: $1.30 vs. $1.01 estimated \n   * **Revenue**: $81.41 billion vs. $73.30 billion estimated, up 36% year-over-year \n   * **iPhone revenue**: $39.57 billion vs. $34.01 billion estimated, up 49.78% year-over-year \n   * **Services revenue**: $17.48 billion vs. $16.33 billion estimated, up 33% year-over-year \n   * **Other Products revenue**: $8.76 billion vs. $7.80 billion estimated, up 40% year-over-year \n   * **Mac revenue**:$8.24 billion vs. $8.07 billion estimated, up 16% year-over-year \n   * **iPad revenue**: $7.37 billion vs. $7.15 billion estimated, up 12% year-over-year \n   * **Gross margin**: 43.3% vs. 41.9% estimated \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) with a host of target raises.
