I've learned a great deal during my journey, which started on this very forum. To parse the incredible amount of data that's available, I've had to learn programing and (re-learn) data science. \n\nThe end result of my efforts (so far) is a fully modular stock screener. It's able to pick and choose numbers from financial reports (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) and not only generate ratios, but as well as trends across time, and compare these companies to their peers. \n\nThere are three limitations to this screener: the first is that the company must have four years of financial information available, so for example, the fan-favorite PLTR is not available. This is kind of by design, because established companies generally safer. The second limitation is that only fundamentals data is included, and price data + options data isn't. That will be addressed in the second part of my project, which deals mainly with risk management (ie: position sizing and diversification). The third limitation is that it's only limited to companies listed on the NASDAQ.\n\nHere's an example output below: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vu5GQ2N\n\nThe first column is the slope of the trend in revenue (flat) over four years (in thousand/day), and the second column is the slope of the trend in net income (flat) over four years (in thousand/day), sorted by the first column. The stocks included in this search are the top 100 technological service companies by market cap. \n\nWhy am I showing off? Well, the first part is a little affirmation for my work. The second part is beta testing. If there are any industry leaders you'd like for me to look and compare fundamentals for, just provide the company and fundamentals and I'll see what I can do. \n\nI hope this post doesn't count as self promotion, as I'm not looking to monetize this in any way shape or form, now and in the future. It's mostly for myself so that I can reduce the amount of research done, and as a programming exercise. \n\nSetting everything up cost me no money, so once I'm done with the complete portfolio management system, I'll deploy it for free along with a white paper showing which metrics best describe the price.",
