But for better or worse, it&#39;s still tied to the BANG gang.</p>\n\n<p>Tread carefully. If you believe in the $BB thesis, and are confident in your ability to time the markets, there&#39;s obviously an optimal play where you time the top, sell, and buy a dip as $BB continues along its long term march. It&#39;s hard to argue that today (and likely tomorrow&#39;s) rise is due to fundamentals.</p>\n\n<h1>However - It&#39;s even harder to argue that GME&#39;s rise today was because they fired their CFO. Point being - Timing the top is difficult (and much more so than seeing a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/\">fundamenta</a>l investment thesis based on $BB&#39;s business reality).</h1>\n\n<h1>My price target is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/\">$60 USD / share</a>, in some reasonable time frame (this year or early next) as $BB shows traction through a couple quarters of earnings.BUT - This is a crazy market. All I can say is paraphrase what somebody wise and rich once said to me - if you&#39;re an investor, think in terms of years. If you&#39;re a trader - best of luck.</h1>\n\n<p>Disclaimer - Just a fool. But sometimes the biggest fool gets all the bananas.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
