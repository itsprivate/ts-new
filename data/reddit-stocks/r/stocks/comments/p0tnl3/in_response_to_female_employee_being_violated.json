The announcement says “Li Yonghe, president of urban retail business group, and HRG Xu Kun take the blame and resign. Alibaba chief human resources officer Tong Wenhong gets recorded for punishment. The suspected male employee is dismissed and will never be hired again. As to whether he is guilty, the police are investigating and collecting evidence.\"\n\nEarlier, it was reported that a female employee of Alibaba was arranged for a business trip and was asked by her direct leader Wang Chengwen to drink wine with merchants. She was assaulted after being drunk. Then, Wang Chengwen went in and out of the female employee's hotel room four times late at night and raped her. She reported it to Alibaba HR and relevant person in charge but got no results. In the end, the victim went to Alibaba’s public cafeteria to hand out flyers to defend her rights.\n\nIn the early morning of August 8, Zhang Yong posted a post on Alibaba's intranet, expressing his feelings about the incident with words such as shock, anger, and shame. At the same time, he said that he must investigate clearly and give an explanation to all employees and the whole society.\n\nOn the evening of August 8, there was a letter titled \"Aliren help Aliren: a joint initiative of 6000 Alirens on the 807 incident\" forwarded on social media. “Aliren” means people of Alibaba. It stated that Alibaba employees have spontaneously established a discussion group called the \"Brave Cattle Help Group\", which will use the above incidents to promote the establishment of an anti-sexual harassment/anti-sexual assault system for employees, especially female employees.\n\nAs of the close of trading on August 6, Alibaba's US stock price was US$196.39, a decrease of 1.45%. As of press time, Alibaba's Hong Kong stock price is 190.1 Hong Kong dollars, a decline of 1.76%.",
