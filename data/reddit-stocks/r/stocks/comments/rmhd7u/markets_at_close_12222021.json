With the VIX falling down to under 19 for the first time in the last week, the markets look set for a Santa Claus rally with one more day of trading before Christmas. \n\nIn a positive sign for Covid-19 (a misnomer) FDA authorized the first pill to treat the disease from Pfizer. With data coming in from South Africa that Omicron has 80% lower hospitalization risk than the other strains, the year-end rally looks even more plausible. \n\nTesla was up by more than 7% today after Elon Musk said he has completed his sale of 10% shares. Musk said in an interview with the satirical website Babylon Bee that this should more than cover his estimated tax bill of over $10 billion. Ever since Musk said about his sale of 10% in the Twitter poll on November 8, the stock has been under pressure and lost more than 25% during the period.\n\nOil prices climbed up higher today with crude inventories down by 4.7 million barrels. The larger-than-expected drawdown in the inventories propelled the crude prices shaking off the Omicron worries.  \n\nAmazon web services went through another outage today. The disruption affected wide range of online giants who are increasingly critical to day-today life. This is the third high-profile disruption in as many weeks. Amazon’s stock has underperformed the other FAANG stocks this year and these continuous outages does not look good for the stock going into the new year.\n\nIn the extended hours, share of Novavax jumped by more than 4% after the drug maker said initial data showed its Covid-19 booster showed immune response against the Omicron variant. Novavax has been seeing wild swings this year after a bumper 30x returns in 2020.",
