  "selftext": "The U.S. economy accelerated in February as omicron waned and government restrictions were lifted, a pair of IHS surveys showed, but businesses increases prices at the fastest pace on record as inflation got worse, according to pair of IHS Markit surveys of business executives.\n\nA “flash” index of service-oriented companies jumped to 57.5 this month from an 18-month low of 51.1 in the first month of 2022, IHS Markit said. A similar gauge of manufacturers rose to 52.5 in February from 50.5.\n\nThe flash IHS surveys offer the first broad look at the performance of the U.S. economy in each month. Any reading above 50 means businesses are growing and numbers above 55% are quite healthy.\n\n**Big picture:** The economy suffered a blow as omicron exploded across the country, but the virus is receding now and governments are dropping restrictions on business such as vaccine mandates. That’s giving a lift to the economy.\n\nPersistent labor and supply shortages remain a drag on the economy, however, and they are adding to the worst bout of U.S. inflation in 40 years. Some executives say the problems eased slight in February, but they are still a big problem.\n\n**Looking ahead:** “The pace of economic growth accelerated sharply in February as virus containment measures, tightened to fight the omicron wave, were scaled back,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “Demand was reported to have revived and supply constraints, both in terms of component availability and staff shortages, moderated.”\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-economy-perks-up-in-february-as-omicron-fades-11645541710?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-economy-perks-up-in-february-as-omicron-fades-11645541710?mod=mw_latestnews)",
