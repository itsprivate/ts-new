I’ve explored the area before academically(learning the terms, following stocks etc.) but only just started playing with actual money and trying to take it seriously. I’ve made some gains so far but thinking long term and big scale I’m feeling discouraged. I feel like I don’t have enough capital or will make enough income to make any worthwhile investment and the only good money making opportunities are all high risk. I know it’s all part of the game but I see people say their portfolio size or say how much they put in a certain stock and I think to myself that I’ll never have close to that much. Is this a normal feeling when starting out? Is there a way to get out of it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
