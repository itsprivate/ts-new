Historically speaking rates have never been increased in a ridiculous manner, as in they increase in either a slow and steady manner or in a \"ladder\" graph manner (see 2004 and 2015 onwards). The dotcom bubble happened while rates were over 5%, same with the 2008 one.\n\nBased on the last 20~ years we can expect rates to take at least 2 years to go back up to a \"decent\" point (2~3%). What this means is that unless a first-time-ever event happens the FED is probably gonna increase their rates next year starting in either spring or summer and at the end of 2022 they're probably still gonna be sub 1%... which means we're talking about a 2~4 year progress until rates stop climbing and stabilize.\n\nThis makes me wonder: why is everyone talking as if the FED starting to increase rates is the apocalypse for the market? What am I missing? Is everyone just absolutely ignorant or am I the one who's missing some other factors? \n\nI understand there's the whole debt to pay your debts, rollovers, whatever you want to call these things, as in highest interest rates = more expensive to finance growth, but I don't see how very slight increases are that much of a problem, it's still very cheap money and even though it might slow growth I don't see how it will stop it and make everything crash. Sure, the market will slow down a bit, growth stocks might stop skyrocketing 40~100% every year, but I don't see how they would stop growing.",
