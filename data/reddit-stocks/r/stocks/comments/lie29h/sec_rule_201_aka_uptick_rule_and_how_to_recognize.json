With my average being around $2.8, I was a little nervous today to go red. BUT an interesting thing happened. I noticed that my broker indicated that from 9:30 today until 20:00 Feb 16 this stuck is traded under SEC 201 rule, meaning that short sellers are not allowed to sell under the highest bid price. It is interesting twhat this simple rule unveiled about this stock: that it is not going down because there is something wrong with the fundamentals, but it is going down because short-sellers are forcing it to. As soon as this rule was executed, the stock started going back up to $3.7 (as of now) from $2.80 in the first 5 minutes of the market (before Rule 201 was imposed and it was going down hard with heavy volume [aka short sellers]). This means that there are more bulls than bears behind this stock, right?</p>\n\n<p>Since I am planning on keeping my position open for the long run, I want to make sure if my understanding of what happened today is right. What do you think?</p>\n\n<p>As another example in contrast to this one, the same thing happened to AEZS on Feb 9 or 10, after a spike in price. But this time the price kept going down, meaning that the price was too high even for the bulls. Is that a correct way to think about this? I appreciate your feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Please keep in mind that this is not financial advice. I am long $ATOS 3,000@$2.8.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention I added a limit sell order of $50.00 to prevent my shares from being lent to short sellers. The idea of short selling makes no sense at all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
