  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey /r Stocks. Admittedly, i usually post this elsewhere, and my series of Due Diligence on this stock is posted elsewhere, but I thought that you guys could actually value this stock on deep value metrics. Please be aware this DD is a day old, and the stock has now been up for the last 5 trading days.</p>\n\n<p>Greetings and salutations. I wrote my last DD on UWMC 2 weeks ago, and it was the latest of a series. With Earnings announced, and the recent runup from its lows, I thought an update was in order as there&#39;s a lot of new information to parse through.</p>\n\n<p>First, a status update on the stock price movement itself. After my last due diligence, the stock continued a downward trend down to 7.18 (for a 5.55% Dividend if you bought at that price point!), before it started sharply reversing course after a Barclay&#39;s Analyst initiated Coverage with a 10$ price target stating that FY 2022 EPS was roughly 6.5 Forward Earnings for 2022, and that UWMC was poised to grab more market share. This was amid a prior backdrop of positive news coverage about how undervalued the stock was, and how it was almost inexplicable (Spanning The Motley Fool, Investor Place, and SeekingAlpha) in the days prior to this analyst coverage.</p>\n\n<p>The Stock has been positive the last 4 trading days, and sharply so. It is up 9.49% on the week, and 13.5% from it&#39;s low point intra-week, and stands at $8.19 right now. That means it still has a dividend yield of 4.88%. With Earnings in two weeks, share-price appreciation is sure to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I wished to speak about long term prospects for the stock. As you might know, the U.S. is around 4 Million Home&#39;s short of buyer demand, as home-builder hesitation over the last decade has led to a meaningful undersupply as Millennials age, and will continue to age into their prime home buying years over the next few years. (<em>WSJ, &quot;</em> U.S. Housing Market Is Nearly 4 Million Homes Short of Buyer Demand.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;Home builders would need to construct between 1.1 million and 1.2 million single-family homes a year to meet long-term demand, but the start rate would need to be even higher to shrink the existing deficit, said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.&quot; Id. That means that homebuilders would need to build over 1.2 Million homes to even -start- to cut into the 4 million deficit of homes. However, fret not because...</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s because &quot;housing starts surged 19.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.739 million units last month.&quot; which beat economist expectations of 1.61. (Reuters, U.S. housing starts near 15-year high; consumer sentiment rises moderately). This is as home prices in the U.S. soared 18% year-over-year in March 2021 to a median of $356,000, meaning that originations grew, and partially offset the slightly shrinking inventory and thus sales (Housingwire, &quot;Home prices soared in March amid record demand&quot;). What further offsets this, is the increase in refinance and home purchase applications as rates have declined to below 3% for the first time in months. (Forbes, &quot;Mortgage Rates Hit Levels Not Seen In Months&quot;). This has led to a refinance surge of 10%, and applications to purchase a home were 6%). This should allow brisk business in Q1 2021, and as refinance activity starts slowing further in the year, there should be more inventory allowing purchases to help make up the shortfall. Considering UWMC has a .15% advantage on rates, this should bode well for them.</p>\n\n<p>While 2022 price increases for homes should be more subdued due to lower timber and associated materials cost, as well as more labor, they are still expected to rise. Furthermore, the purchase market is going to grow in 2021 from 2020, and beyond. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) announced today at its <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3141176.t.en25.com%2Fe%2Fer%3Futm_campaign%3DMBA%2520Spring%2520Forecast%2520Release%2520-%25204-22-21%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DEloqua%26s%3D3141176%26lid%3D4748%26elqTrackId%3D370E3664A52473C73B49C93E9CDC87D2%26elq%3D25b31323597b436aac47d90e1427d551%26elqaid%3D1460%26elqat%3D1&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cftaylor%40mba.org%7C7c50297093de479245f008d9059eadeb%7C867e5d11bde4499fb45e61572f9f337c%7C1%7C0%7C637547001352783149%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=tZj6grBtgKax8K8BkZcaUb3m%2F9NF4R4%2FoB5hFMipd44%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><strong>Spring Conference and Expo 2021</strong></a> that purchase originations are on track to grow 16.4% to a new record of $1.67 trillion in 2021. The MBA forecasts volume to fall 14% this year to $3.28 trillion, which would still be the third-highest total ever. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are more optimistic with Fannie May Predicting $4 Trillion in Mortgage Originations in 2021, and Freddie Mac is predicting $3.5 Trillion in Mortgage Originations in 2021. With that said Fannie Mae recently revised upward from that 4 Trillion Number.</p>\n\n<p>This is what Fannie Mae Predicted in their upward revised predictions:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Consistent with a stronger home price growth forecast, the outlook for purchase mortgage originations has been boosted by $66 billion for 2021 and $84 billion for 2022 to $1.9 trillion each year compared to the March forecast. Refinance volume is unchanged at $2.1 trillion for this year and will decline 48 percent next year to $1.1 trillion, a $40 billion downward revision from the previous forecast. Around 42 percent of all outstanding mortgages have at least a 50-basis point incentive to refinance at current rates, which is down from nearly 70 percent at the end of 2020. &quot; -- April 16, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I expect interest rates to stay level or even dip more as people flock to TIPS- <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-stay-hungry-for-inflation-protected-bonds-11619461270\">Investors Stay Hungry for Inflation-Protected Bonds - WSJ</a> , and as foreign investors continue to purchase Treasuries (Though I am not sure how much stronger demand will be as they&#39;ve already returned).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I&#39;m going to talk about what can be expected regarding Earnings and leading up to it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>MSR Asset Value will increase organically as interest rates from Feb 2 were at 1.1% roughly (WSJ 10 YR Treasury Table), and have increased to roughly 1.56%. As Interest rates go up, the value of MSR&#39;s go up and this asset is continuously adjusted each quarter as a result.</li>\n<li>With a Net Income of roughly 1 Billion this quarter at minimum, and a Shareholder&#39;s Equity at 2.374B, there will be a Return on Equity of 42.1% on this quarter alone, and the ROE will easily lie between 100 and 200% for FY 2021.</li>\n<li>The Annual Income Yield, and the interest on the 2025 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes comes to 41.5 Million, and 81 Million Respectively. This is very, very, easily serviceable. (Class A Shares are dividend shares, where Class D stocks held by the owner are not). This is incredibly bullish, as the CEO would prefer to put the money he otherwise would have gotten back into the company to grow it. If his Class D shares were Class A shares, the Annual Dividend would be 640 Million. The Payout Ratio is still very low, but i believe their CEO would rather use the money to eat market share and grow his company rather than be issued a dividend. At least at this point in time.</li>\n<li>The Senior Note Raise of 700 Million for 2029 will prove to have been a bullish indicator as you need capital to originate loans, and to secure more Mortgage Servicing Rights. The Mortgage Servicing Rights, will provide a constant stream of Cash Flow as well. The Company made over 3.38 Billion Dollars in Net Income last year, and is on pace to have a similar tally this year (Though not quite as high), because their bread and butter is purchase as opposed to refinance. Purchase&#39;s have outpaced refinance at times this year, and going forward into the second half of this year it&#39;s going to remain that way. UWMC does better in this environment, and it will be able to gain and sustain market share as a result.</li>\n<li>RKT Earnings are on May 5th, and I expect a sympathy move for UWMC.</li>\n<li>May 7 is when Russel Reconstitution Preliminary List comes out, and I expect UWMC will be there.</li>\n<li>May 10 will be Earnings, and May 11 will be the Call with Analysts to discuss results. I think we can expect some heady things.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-2021-Q1-Earnings-Conference-Call-Details/default.aspx\">https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-2021-Q1-Earnings-Conference-Call-Details/default.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>Position: 4,519 Shares, and 22 7.5 May 21 Contracts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
