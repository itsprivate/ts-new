CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.</p>\n\n<p>The CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hierarchy</strong></p>\n\n<p>CD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.</p>\n\n<p>The subsidiaries are:</p>\n\n<p>- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).</p>\n\n<p>- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)</p>\n\n<p>- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)</p>\n\n<p>- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)</p>\n\n<p>- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)</p>\n\n<p><strong>GOG -</strong> Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It&#39;s main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it&#39;s platform that Steam doesn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>Steam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it&#39;s been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It&#39;s very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don&#39;t have access to it&#39;s numbers.</p>\n\n<p>However the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it&#39;s games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. <strong>One third</strong> of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.</p>\n\n<p>This is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>GWENT: The Witcher Card Game</em></strong> is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it&#39;s their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cyberpunk</strong> was released recently and had been in development for many years. It&#39;s sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it&#39;s PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cyberpunk Online</strong> multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here&#39;s a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for <em>Key Sources Of Revenue</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>■ sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:</p>\n\n<p>- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it&#39;s not a certainty.</p>\n\n<p>- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP&#39;s in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.</p>\n\n<p>- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Co-Founders and Board History</strong></p>\n\n<p>CD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red&#39;s stock, including the joint CEO&#39;s. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.</p>\n\n<p>Company shareholding structure is made up of the following people:</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Marcin Iwinski</strong> (Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is <strong>13%</strong></p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Michal Kicinski</strong> (Ex Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is <strong>11%</strong></p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Piotr Nielubowicz</strong> (VP, CFO) is <strong>6%</strong></p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Adam Kicinski</strong> (President &amp; Joint CEO) is <strong>3%</strong></p>\n\n<p>Incentives for management:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.</p>\n\n<p>Management hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  </p>\n\n<p>Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it&#39;s still possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Competitors</strong></p>\n\n<p>CD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there’s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.</p>\n\n<p>Thus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.</p>\n\n<p>CD Projekt Red&#39;s risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Industry</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>-</strong> CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook 2020–2024).  </p>\n\n<p>- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reverse DCF</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the original post and reverse DCF because <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> does not allow images: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red&#39;s growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty~ as I don&#39;t think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.</p>\n\n<p>Please comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation. This was a very difficult one for me.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
