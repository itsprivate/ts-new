  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**\n\nThe market edged higher once again, with both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. \n\nAfter driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. \n\nKeith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,\" he added. \"And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive.\" \n\nLater today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** \n\nOn Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)\n* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. \n* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10.
