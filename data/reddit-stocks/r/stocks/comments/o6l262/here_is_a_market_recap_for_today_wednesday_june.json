  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 23, 2021** \n\nStocks rose again today, as inflationary concerns continue to abate, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) powering to a new fresh intraday high driven by the continued rallies in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) The S&P 500 (SPY) continues to hover 2-3 points below its record high while the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover after suffering its worst performance since October 2020 last week. \n\nIn a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. \n\nAs expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. \n\nLooking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings, with analysts expecting a repeat of Q1 record setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand by savings-laden consumers as the US economy is finally open to begin broadly reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine.  So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\nMoreover, tomorrow Thursday  the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.\n\nOn Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Southwest Airlines (LUV) CEO Gary Kelly announced he would be stepping down and transitioning to becoming Executive Chairman of the Board. \n* New home sales fell unexpectedly for the second straight Month in May, according to the Commerce Department. This shows a slow down in market activity after the frenzy experienced in the beginning of this year. New home sales were down 5.9% in May over April, compared to a rise of 0.2% that was expected. \n* Amazon (AMZN) prime day was very strong despite supply chain challenges. Analyst are expecting Prime Day sales of $9.5 - $12 billion. AMZN stock currently hovers a few percentage points from its record high.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) became the second company, after Apple (AAPL) to reach the $2 trillion market cap milestone. Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, briefly had a $2t market cap a while ago but has since lost it. \n* France is suing Apple over allegedly abusive contractual terms imposed on developers and startups that seek to sell their apps on the tech giant's App Store, a spokesperson for the finance ministry's consumer fraud watchdog told Reuters\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Carvana (CVNA) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $375 to $400 at Buy. Stock currently around $313\n* FedEx (FDX) target raised by Barclays from $360 to $375 at Overweight. Stock currently around $298\n* McDonald's (MCD) target raised by Wells Fargo from $262 to $268 at Overweight. Stock currently around $234\n* Olin (OLN) target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $63 to $65 at Outperform. Stock currently around $46\n* Microsoft (MSFT) target raised by Wedbush from $310 to $325 at Outperform. Stock currently around $265\n* Peloton (PTON) target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $120 to $135 at Outperform. Stock currently around $117\n\n“\"An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” — Benjamin Franklin",
