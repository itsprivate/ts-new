This happens because one of the greeks is called Vega which controls options prices based on implied volatility changes.</p>\n\n<p>When IV increases significantly, prices for both calls and puts also increase by a large amount because an increase in vega positively correlates with an increase in prices irrespective of whether it&#39;s a call or put.</p>\n\n<p>Another tip. If you really like the $GME company, you can sell far out of the money puts tomorrow (cash secured puts) for extremely high premiums. That gives you an extremely low risk and high reward. I might sell Jan 22 $20 puts.</p>\n\n<p>GME Historical IV: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/xK5ooKn.png\">https://i.imgur.com/xK5ooKn.png</a> (Source: Tradytics)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
