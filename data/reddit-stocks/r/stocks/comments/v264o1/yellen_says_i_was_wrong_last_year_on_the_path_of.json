Consumer prices in April rose 8.3% from a year before, close to the 40-year high reached in March.\n\nJobs Slowdown\n\nYellen highlighted how well the economy has performed in other respects, particularly with regard to employment. But she also made clear that she didn’t expect the same robust pace of growth and job creation the US has enjoyed during the recovery from the crisis.\n\n“Now we’re in a period of transition,” she said. “We’re not expecting to see the same kinds of job gains, monthly job gains or growth figures going forward. We’re looking at steady and stable growth and bringing inflation down.”\n\nAsked if the US had seen the worst of the inflation spike, Yellen said it was encouraging that core inflation -- a measure that strips out energy and food prices in an effort to show the trend in underlying inflation -- had dropped.\n\nThe core gauge of consumer prices eased to a 6.2% gain in the year through April and is expected to continue slowing in future months. \n\nStill, Yellen noted that European countries have recently taken steps to limit their imports of Russian oil -- a move that has caused global oil prices to rise. “We can’t rule out further shocks,” she said.",
