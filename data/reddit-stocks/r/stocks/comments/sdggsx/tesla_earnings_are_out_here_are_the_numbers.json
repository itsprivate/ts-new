Here are the results.\n\nEarnings (adjusted): $2.54 vs $2.36 per share expected, per Refinitiv\n\nRevenue: $17.72 billion vs $16.57 billion expected, per Refinitiv\n\nRevenue rose 65% year over year in the quarter, while net income, at $2.32 billion, was up some 760%, according to a statement.\n\nTesla reported a 27.4% gross margin, compared with 26.6% in the previous quarter.\n\n“Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022,” the company said.\n\nThe report comes in the midst of the most important tech earnings season in years. The Nasdaq has suffered its worst January since 2008 as many investors have begun to sour on the promise of high-growth tech stocks.\n\nIn 2021, Tesla delivered 936,172 vehicles, an 87% increase versus 2020 when it reported its first annual profit on deliveries of 499,647. Its 2021 deliveries included 308,600 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter. (Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales reported by Tesla.)\n\nCEO Elon Musk and other execs are expected to give a progress update on the company’s long-delayed heavy duty Semi truck, experimental Cybertruck pickup, and plans for driverless vehicle systems and a $25,000 compact car.\n\nWith factories being built in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany, shareholders also want to know when high-volume vehicle production and deliveries are expected to start at each plant.\n\nTesla’s guidance may be tempered by supply chain issues, if Musk’s tweets are any indication. On November 29, 2021, he wrote on Twitter, “Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare &amp; it’s not over! I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call.”\n\n[Credit to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/26/tesla-tsla-earnings-q4-2021.html)",
