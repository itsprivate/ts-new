Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, our revenue would have grown 22% year-over-year to RMB187,306 million (US$29,010 million).\n* **Annual active consumers** of the Alibaba Ecosystem across the world reached approximately 1.18 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 45 million from the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. This includes 912 million consumers in China1 and 265 million consumers overseas served by Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol and Daraz.\n* **Income from operations** was RMB30,847 million (US$4,778 million), a decrease of 11% year-over-year. **Adjusted EBITDA**, a non-GAAP measurement, decreased 5% year-over-year to RMB48,628 million (US$7,532 million). **Adjusted EBITA**, a non-GAAP measurement, decreased 8% year-over-year to RMB41,731 million (US$6,463 million). The year-over-year decreases were primarily due to our investments in strategic areas to capture incremental opportunities, such as Community Marketplaces, Taobao Deals, Local Consumer Services and Lazada, as well as our increased spending on growth initiatives within China retail marketplaces, such as Idle Fish and Taobao Live, and our support to merchants.\n* **Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders** was RMB45,141 million (US$6,991 million), and **net income** was RMB42,835 million (US$6,634 million). **Non-GAAP net income** was RMB43,441 million (US$6,728 million), an increase of 10% year-over-year, mainly due to an increase in share of profit of equity method investees.\n* **Diluted earnings per ADS** was RMB16.38 (US$2.54) and **diluted earnings per share** was RMB2.05 (US$0.32 or HK$2.46). **Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS** was RMB16.60 (US$2.57), an increase of 12% year-over-year and **non-GAAP diluted earnings per share** was RMB2.08 (US$0.32 or HK$2.50), an increase of 12% year-over-year.\n* **Net cash** **provided by operating activities** was RMB33,603 million (US$5,204 million). **Non-GAAP free cash flow** was RMB20,683 million (US$3,203 million), a decrease compared to RMB36,570 million in the same quarter of 2020, mainly due to the partial settlement in the amount of RMB9,114 million (US$1,412 million) of the RMB18,228 million fine levied earlier this year by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation pursuant to China’s Anti-monopoly Law (the \"Anti-monopoly Fine\") and a decrease in profit as a result of our investments in key strategic areas.\n\nLink: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-announces-june-quarter-105400522.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-announces-june-quarter-105400522.html)",
