Of that $550 billion in spending above previously projected federal levels, $110 billion would go toward roads and bridges, $66 billion to rail and nearly $40 billion to transit.

Roughly $7.5 billion is dedicated to building additional charging stations for electric vehicles, while another $7.5 billion would help fund swapping out current school buses and ferries with lower-emission replacements.\n\nFull story here- [https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-set-to-pass-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-tuesday-11628597274?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-set-to-pass-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-tuesday-11628597274?mod=hp_lead_pos1)",
