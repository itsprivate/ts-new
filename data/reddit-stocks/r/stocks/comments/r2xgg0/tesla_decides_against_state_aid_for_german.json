For some reason, governments don’t want to do that...,\" Musk added, deviating from the subject of the factory grant.\n\nTesla itself is investing 5 billion euros in the battery plant, according to German economy ministry estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, construction of a car production site alongside the battery plant, which Tesla has begun building under pre-approval permits while it awaits final approval from the regional government, has made good progress in the last few weeks, a spokesperson for the federal economy ministry said.\n\nThe electric vehicle maker also applied in November 2020 for regional funding from Brandenburg, according to the regional government's website.\n\nA Brandenburg economy ministry spokesperson said this application had not been withdrawn.\n\nThe amount Tesla applied for is undisclosed, but investments worth over 100 million euros are generally given 6.8% of their value, the website says.\n\nThe latest round of online consultations for the public to express environmental and other concerns about the car factory and battery plant closed last week and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes to formally begin production by the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.\n\nMusk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change. \n\nSource: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-withdrew-state-funding-application-german-battery-plant-economy-ministry-2021-11-26/",
