However, there has been a massive spike recently of people that finish they DD with ‘this could be the next GME’ or something similar and as soon as I read that, I am instantly out off. </p>\n\n<p>Everything they have said up to that point gets a little tainted for me. </p>\n\n<p>I know this is completely irrational and actually a bit stupid on my part but I equate it to a restaurant that has ‘The Best (insert food item)‘ or ‘World Famous blah blah’ on their menu.
