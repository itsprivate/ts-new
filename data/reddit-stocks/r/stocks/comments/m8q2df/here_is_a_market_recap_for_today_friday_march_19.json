  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC’s comments earlier this week. </p>\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.</p>\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued [Thursday].” It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. </p>\n\n<p>Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today&#39;s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dropped after China reportedly banned some state and military personnel from using the company&#39;s vehicles over national security concerns, according to reports from outlets including Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-to-restore-bank-capital-requirements-as-treasury-markets-130935328.html\">U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Friday</a> that it will not extend a temporary bank leverage ratio exemption past its March 31 expiration date. Leverage ratio put simply, is a regulation that restricts how much money a bank can lend relative to how much capital the bank devotes to its own assets. The exemption that is expiring at the end of the month made lowered the leverage ratio to allow banks to lend out money more easily.</li>\n<li>NFL sold Amazon (AMZN) exclusive rights to stream Thursday Night Football in their platform.</li>\n<li>Taiwan&#39;s Foxconn is in early stage talks with Vietnamese carmaker VinFast about partnering in electric vehicles, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.</li>\n<li>Goldman Sachs on Thursday raised its forecast for the adoption of battery electric vehicles in the U.S saying, “We now expect battery electric vehicles to comprise 20% of U.S. sales in 2025, 40% in 2030, 60% in 2035, and 75% in 2040.”</li>\n<li>According to the Motion Picture Association, the number of subs to video streaming services grew to 1.1 billion in 2021.
