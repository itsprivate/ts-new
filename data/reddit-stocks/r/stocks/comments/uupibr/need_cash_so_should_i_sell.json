If not, God forbid, I can not pay mortgages. \n\nAnother problem is, my company stopped hiring new people. What if this is a sign of lay offs in my company? \n\nWhat would you do if you were me?\n\nEDIT: I will try to sell our second home in the next 2 months. The only issue is, I will probably take a slight hit with that but thats okay. \nIf I can not sell it, then I will liquidate my stocks and wait for a few months for the recession to end. \n\nThank you all for very valuable and smart suggestions.",
