It usually comes with the title **How to 3x the S&P CAGR with less risk | Leverage for the Long Run** with people praising it as an amazing new strategy that requires little effort, provides a high degree of safety, and allows you to experience only the good side of leveraged ETFs. Here's why it's complete bullshit. \n\nI've seen the 200 SMA argument posted hundreds of times before in r/LETFs. I'm glad this one at least comes with a paper, but the paper is still falling for the same mistakes other believers fall for. The author is correct that volatility increases below any significant moving average (20/50/100/200), however, avoiding volatility should not be your main concern when holding unhedged leveraged ETFs. Your main concern should be flash crashes like in 1987 where the market fell 22% in one day. The author says this:\n\n> Chart 6 shows that historically, the worst 1% of trading days have occurred far more often than not below the Moving Average. Included in this list are the two worst days in market history: October 19th in 1987 and October 28th in 1929\n\nWow look at that, moving averages helped avoid the worst two days... but why? The answer is partially due to the fact that both the best and worst days will be in periods of high volatility, but it's also heavily influenced by pure chance. A day like Black Monday could happen at anytime and if there wasn't a choppy market leading up to it you will miss it with moving averages. An unleveraged 22% drop would be a 66% drop for the portfolio suggested in the paper. The market would then likely dip below the 200 SMA and the person would sell! Missing the entire ride back up, even if there was more to fall you're not going to be left in a good place. \n\nThere is no macroeconomic reason that moving averages have any form of predictive power. The closest thing would be the concept of a self fulfilling prophecy which would require a massive audience of believers to have an impact (there are not nearly enough). People always use 200 SMA, but if you try to test other SMAs nearby you sometimes get significantly worse results. The 200 SMA just happens to get you out before the Dot Com crash as well as the GFC. When your entire reasoning is based on *well it did good in the past* you're overfitting by definition. \n\nLet's look at another strategy that **has** an economic backing - HFEA. Holding stocks and bonds together isn't something that *just happens to work* when you test it. When stocks experience uncertainty large investors move their money into the safety of bonds which forces them in the opposite direction to the stock. Stocks and bonds are slightly, but not perfectly inversely correlated **and** both of them have positive expected returns. This is why they are the ideal hedge. \n\nI also want to point out that **this is not an academic paper that came from a university**. It was published by https://www.leadlagreport.com/ which says on its homepage \"Consistently win in the stock market and minimize risk regardless of market conditions\" followed by a subscribe button. This is called bullshit and I encourage anyone who cares about honesty to call it out when shit like this is posted.",
