So I decided to do that.  I went back over 21 separate decisions I've made to sell stocks over the past 12-18 months to see what happened in the months after the sales.\n\nNone of these were short-term trades, they were all intended to be long-term investments when I bought them but ended up deciding to sell.  Sometimes it was based on technical signals (new downtrends, violation of the 50 day moving average, price running up too fast and getting over-extended beyond the 50 DMA) but other times it was based on concerns about valuation.  Sometimes it was pure impatience, getting frustrated with a stock going nowhere and wanting to find a better opportunity.\n\nOut of the 21 sell decisions, 18 of them turned out to be wrong in the sense that the price ended up higher than my sell price within the ensuing weeks and months.  In only 3 of the 21 cases did the decision to sell turn out to be a good one.  But the important thing is what I can learn from this to improve my decisions in the future.  Here are some observations:\n\n1) A break below the 50 day moving average is a very unreliable sell signal, especially if the stock remains in a longer term uptrend.  Price dropping below the 50 DMA theoretically signals a change in the medium term trend, which could foretell the beginning of a longer term downtrend.  But in almost every case where I sold after the stock dropped below the 50 DMA, it reversed course within days and continued up.  The only case where this turned out to be a good signal was when the stock traded below the 50 DMA for several weeks.\n\n2) Don't sell stocks based on concern about valuation.  Valuing stocks isn't an exact science; I'm not a professional and even professionals can have very different opinions about the fair value of a stock.  In every single case where I sold because I thought the stock got \"overvalued,\" it continued climbing.  This is where some of my biggest mistakes happened in terms of lost profits.  For example, I sold APPS last October for a 6x return at $32 only to watch it hit $100 within 5 months.\n\n3) Selling when the stock dropped was always a mistake.  This overlaps with (1) because the drops typically coincided with a technical signal (breaking below the 50 DMA or breaking a support level), but every time that happened the stock reversed course soon after.  Unless the selloff reflects an underlying change in the long-term prospects for the business, you should be taking advantage of drops to buy not sell.\n\nTo be fair to myself, some of these decisions could have turned out to be correct if I moved the money elsewhere and saw better returns than if I had left the money where it was.  But the results clearly show that premature selling is a costly mistake.",
