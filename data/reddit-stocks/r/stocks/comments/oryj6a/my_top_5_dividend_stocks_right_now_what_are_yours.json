  "selftext": "# How to pick dividend stocks\n\nA classic mistake that investors make when looking for dividend stocks is to just go for the biggest dividend yield. It makes sense, right? Get the most value for your money? Well, not really. This can actually be very misleading. Typically, the stocks with the highest dividend cannot sustain it. Some companies start squeezing as much cash as possible out of their operations, cutting costs, cutting corners to get that dividend to the shareholders. In the process, they bleed their business dry and they end up with a company that is in no position to grow. We don't want that. Personally, I like nothing more than a healthy business with good prospects paying a dividend. Most importantly, I want that dividend to be sustainable and I want companies to have a record of raising the dividend. I do **not** want companies that have lowered or suspended their dividend in the last ten years. This is not a foolproof method, but it increases the likelihood that you will get a company that pays a sustainable, growing dividend. Also, with these types of stocks, it is good to manage your expectations. Chances are that you will not see them double or triple in price over a few months like a hot tech stock, but instead you will get a reliable income year in and year out along with a modest price increase. Right? So, in my opinion, these five dividend stocks are a great deal right now. However, before I share them with you, I want to ask you what are your favourite dividend stocks? Why do you like them? Let me know in the comments below.\n\n# Verizon Communications (VZ)\n\nOkay, so, first off, we have Verizon Communications. Verizon is a telecommunications company and they are currently focusing on building up their 5G capabilities and adoption. One of their flagship services is Fios which is a bundled fiber optic service that provides internet access, telephone and television services. Verizon's wireless network provides the broadest coverage in the industry although their 5G coverage is only half of T-Mobile's, but is still better than AT&T's. Essentially, they are a big, established telecommunications player and they are not going anywhere. Their price right now is decent. Currently, they trade at a PE of 12.2 which has been pretty much typical for the company over the last 5 years and is normal for the industry. They also have a forward PE of 10.9, which is relatively cheap for Verizon so that's good to see. However, Verizon's best selling point right now is their dividend. They currently offer a strong dividend of 4.49%, but the best part about it is that Verizon have raised it ***every single year*** in the last 10 years! Every single year! Plus, the average for the top 25% companies in the US by dividends is about 3.5% so Verizon is offering an above-average dividend for the US! The dividend is covered by Verizon's earnings with the payout ratio being about 55% right now, but it is expected to drop to 49% next year. If you're not sure what the payout ratio is, it is essentially the dividends divided by the company's earnings so, with Verizon, we can see that they pay out 55% of their earnings as dividends. This is relatively high, but Verizon is a dividend company so a 50% payout ratio is expected and normal. Plus, Finbox's discounted cash flow model values Verizon at $72 while SimplyWallStreet values the company at an astonishing $150. I doubt it will go up that much, but my point is that Verizon is undervalued based on its free cash flow so that's another bullish argument for the company.\n\n# Kellogg (K)\n\nMy second favourite dividend stock right now is Kellogg, a classic consumer staples stock. As most of you probably know, Kellogg produces and sells ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods like crackers, cereal and granola bars, waffles, noodles and so on. Essentially, it is a stock and a company that does well regardless of what situation the economy is in. People buy cereal during recession and during economic boom. Plus, the stock is inflation-proof because Kellogg can pass on increased costs to its customers. Kellogg's earnings are also expected to grow by 5% annually over the next 3 years which is decent for a stock of Kellogg's size. When it comes to the dividend, the company has a stable cashflow and can afford to pay out a consistent and stable dividend. We can see that in their payout ratio which is 61% for this year and expected to be 56% in next year. Most importantly, Kellogg has raised its dividend every year for the last 10 years and right now has a dividend yield of 3.7%. The industry average for food manufacturers is 2.6% and like I mentioned before, the average for the top 25% of dividend payers in the US is 3.5%. Kellogg pays a higher dividend than both, which is really good to see. Also, Kellogg's discounted cash flow is valued at $82.7 by Finbox and $120 by SimplyWallStreet so there is the bullish case for a higher price there. The stock currently trades at a PE of 17 and a forward PE of 15, both of which are under the average PE of 22.1 for the US Food industry. Overall, Kellogg seems like a good deal right now.\n\n# Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)\n\nThe third favourite dividend stock is the Walgreens Boots Alliance, another consumer staples stock. The company is a pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company and operates over 9,000 stores in the US under the Walgreens and Duane Reade brands. Similar to Kellogg, the Walgreens Boots Alliance does okay regardless of what situation the economy is in. The stock is inflation-proof and it is also a good way to get exposure to the retail and health industries. Again, just like Kellogg, Walgreens have a steady cash flow which enables it to pay a sustainable dividend. Their dividend yield is 4.1%, higher than the average for consumer retailing industry which stands at 1.6% and also places Walgreens in the top dividend payers in the US overall. Like Verizon and Kellog, Walgreens has also raised their dividend every year for the last 10 years. Their payout ratio is 72% this year, but it's expected to drop down to 38% next year. That's because Walgreens experienced a drop in earnings during the lockdown, but their operating and free cash flow remained the same meaning that there are no problems with the business. That's also why they are expected to increase their earnings by 22% annually over the next three years. Right now, they trade at a good price. Their PE ratio is 17.9 compared to the industry average of 16.7, but their forward PE is 9.2 which is really good. They are valued at $69 by Finbox and $120 by SimplyWallStreet so again there is a bullish case for a jump in price. Overall, Walgreens is a low-risk high-paying dividend stock.\n\n# STAG Industrial (STAG) and Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nMy final two dividend stocks today are STAG Industrial and the Medical Properties Trust. Both of these are real estate investment trusts, abbreviated as REITs. STAG Industrial focuses on acquiring and operating single-tenant industrial properties whereas the Medical Properties Trust acquires and develops net-leased hospital facilities. I like these two for several reasons. First, they've got an excellent dividend. STAG has a dividend of 3.6% whereas the Medical Properties Trust has a solid 5.3% dividend yield! The average dividend for REITs is about 2.9% so both of these offer really good dividends! Again, similar to the other three companies before, both STAG and the Medical Properties Trust have raised their dividend numerous times. Plus, they have ***never ever*** suspended or lowered it. They do have a high payout ratio with 68% to 79% for STAG and 65% to 70% for the Medical Properties Trust, but a high payout ratio is typical for REITs. Paying dividends is really what a REIT is meant to do so that's not surprising. Plus, both STAG and the Medical Properties Trust have a high level of occupancy which means that we can expect sustainable earnings and therefore sustainable dividends from them. However, there is another reason why I like these two. Inflation is on everybody's mind right now and buying real estate is the ***perfect hedge against inflation*** because real estate tends to go up in price during inflationary periods. REITs allow you to buy real estate without having to dish out money for a mortgage and tying yourself down for 20 years! It allows you to benefit from rising real estate prices and that is an important benefit of owning REITs. With STAG and the Medical Properties Trust you will not only be getting an amazing dividend stock, you will also be protecting your portfolio from inflation. Two birds with one stone.\n\nWhat are your favourite dividend stocks?",
