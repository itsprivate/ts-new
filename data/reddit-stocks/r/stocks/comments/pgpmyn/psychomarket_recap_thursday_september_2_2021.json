The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the three major indexes, rising 0.68%. Following the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium last week, market participants are anxiously waiting for the August Jobs Report, which will further illuminate the state of the labor market, a key factor in the Fed’s decision-making regarding a potential taper timeline. \n\nADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the official August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.\n\nMike Loewengart, managing director of investing strategy at E-Trade Financial, wrote in a note to clients, “The private payroll numbers have been all over the map during the pandemic. But with so much pressure on improvement on the labor market front coming from the Fed, this could send a signal that jobs growth is stagnating. That’s likely a good thing for the markets, though, as it means easy money policy continues.” \n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” As I have said multiple times in the past, personally, I remain bullish even during tapering talk, I think the real test for equities will come when interest rate hikes start being discussed.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Party’s drive to “common prosperity”. \n* Walmart (WMT) bumped hourly wages by $1 to an average of $16.40 an hour as the holiday season, the most important time of the year for retailers, is set to kick off.\n* Yesterday, I talked about Ford Motors (F) cutting back production due to chip shortages.
