That's due to a \"continuation of the trends impacting revenue growth in the first quarter, including softness in the back half of the first quarter that coincided with the war in Ukraine,\" as well as expectations that currency changes would provide a 3% headwind.\n\nThe company sees 2022 total expenses in the range of $87 billion-$92 billion, down from a prior outlook for $90 billion-$95 billion, with expenses driven mainly by Family of Apps rather than Reality Labs. And 2022 capital expenditures are forecast for $29 billion-$34 billion (unchanged).",
