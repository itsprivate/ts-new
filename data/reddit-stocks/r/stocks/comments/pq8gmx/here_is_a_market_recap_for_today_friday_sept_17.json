  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 17, 2021**\n\nStocks declined today, reversing from yesterday’s gain given today was a quadruple witching event and market participants continue to digest a slew of new economic data and the potential implications for monetary policy. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.97% down, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.19% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.53% down. As of today’s close, September is headed for its first negative month all year.\n\nToday was the quarterly quadruple witching, an event wherein individual stock options and futures, and index options and futures, all expire the same day. Typically, this event has elevated volume and volatility on the day and days leading up to it. Definitely one of the reasons for today’s decline. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China’s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nAll the recent data will factor into the Federal Reserve’s latest assessment of the economy, which is set to be released next week via the meeting minutes. Market participants are anxiously waiting to see if the incoming meeting minutes have a signal regarding the timing to announce plans to begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. \n\nMark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said “I think it’s really a tug of war at the moment that is underway, which is to say, there’s still good news on the economy. In fact, in the last two days, we've gotten some good regional Fed survey reports and today's retail sales number. But at the same time, it's in the context of this overall deceleration of growth we've seen so far in the third quarter \\[and\\] worries about the Delta variant.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to the University of Michigan’s closely watched consumer sentiment survey, sentiment improved only slightly in September after reaching its lowest level since 2011 in August. The headline index in the institution's Surveys of Consumers ticked up to 71.0 in the preliminary reading, compared to the 70.3 posted in August. Consensus economists were looking for the index to improve to 72.0 in September.\n* Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc will give a one-time bonus of $1,250 to its full-time pharmacists and a $1,000 payment to part-time pharmacists, the drugstore chain said on Friday, as major retailers try to retain people amid intense labor shortages. This is a similar effort other retailers have employed.\n* Irish regulators raised privacy concerns regarding Facebook’s (FB) new smart glasses. The concern comes that people have a difficult timing  telling whether the glasses are filming or not\n* Tencent (TCEHY) opens WeChat, the super app with more than $1 billion users, to allows rivals to display their links. This comes after Chinese regulators banned the practice of Chinese tech companies banning links to rivals within their platforms\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) target raised by Cowen from $!65 to $200 at Outperform. Stock currently around $174\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Barclays from $320 to $330 at Overweight. Stock currently around $260\n* Datadog (DDOG) target raised by Barclays from $156 to $180 at Overweight. Stock currently around $143\n* Facebook (FB) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $425 to $450 at Buy. Stock currently around $364\n* Alphabet (GOOGL) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $3150 to $3325 at Buy. Stock currently around $2815\n* Lululemon (LULU) target raised by Oppenheimer from $405 to $520 at Outperform. Stock currently around $427\n* Microsoft (MSFT) target raised by Barclays from $$330 to $345 at Overweight.
