Been thinking about treat myself something nice after my first paycheck, but heard about all the great things of delayed gratification and compound interest. So, I saved every penny I possibly could and invested in stocks. After school started, I continued to work there part-time.\n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago, I broke with my girlfriend and went on a shopping spread. Bought a nice PC, pair of sneakers, and some fancy outfit for the fall/winter. I don't really regret the purchases, as impulsive as it may sound, I can actually manage to pay it off in  3 months. But just during my class this morning, my manager texted me and laid me off. Mostly because as the weather gets colder, fewer people will need A/C and fewer things to do in the store. So now my plan is in scrumble.\n\nI have about 7K in stocks, and 3K in credit card debts. \n\n1st option, borrow from friends and pay them off after I got another job.\n\n2nd option, apply for a balance transfer card, get the debts to 0% APR, and pay the minimum off until I got a job.\n\n3rd option, and my least favorite, sold half of my position, and just get the debts out of the way right now.\n\nMy current position:\n\n$SOFI 140\n\n$MSFT 5\n\n$AGNC 50\n\n$AXP 4\n\n$JPM 4\n\n$GS 1\n\n$AAPL 1\n\nand some fractional shares of TSLA, ISRG about 500.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I do go with 3rd option, which stocks should I let go first?\n\nAny helps are greatly appreciated.",
