  "selftext": "Five months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation to determine whether it's really as cheap as Tesla bulls say, or as expensive as most of the rest of the sub thinks it is.\n\nAfter yesterday's earnings report, it seems like my analysis has already been proven incorrect, and I felt it would be worth having another look at it.\n\nFor those who don't like reading, I will again explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to \"The Numbers\"\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The method**\n\nWhile trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might rise slightly higher today, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The trends**\n\nIn terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my last analysis. After Q1, that has grown to $62,190M, with Q1 being a 87% YoY increase.\n\nIn terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q1, that has grown to 19.2%, equalling market leader Ferrari.\n\nIn terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. After Q1, this has grown to $8,399M, with Q1 being a 658% YoY increased.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The future**\n\nLast time, I said the following:\n\n&gt; Obviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.\n\nWe have now seen that not only did the opening of Giga Texas and Berlin not compress margins, margins even increased by 30% or 4,500 basis points from 14.7% to 19.2% during this quarter. This was highly unexpected and very bullish for Tesla's future expansion in my opinion.\n\nI also said:\n\n&gt; That said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.\n\nWhile we have yet to see the impact on margins (only about a thousand cars from Berlin were sold in Q1 and none from Texas), it has been confirmed that Berlin is using the single-piece casted front and rear underbody, as is Texas. Texas is also already using the structural battery pack.\n\nThen I said:\n\n&gt; In terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.\n\nI think this number for Texas and Berlin in 2022 proved a little optimistic, given the currently supply chain shortages. Texas and Berlin are currently rumoured to have a run rate of 13,000 per quarter each and are expected to start meaningfully contributing to production in Q3. As such, I would lower my estimate to ~400,000 from Texas and Berlin this year.\n\nThat said, Tesla expects the full ramp-up of Texas and Berlin to happen faster than it did for Shanghai. As such, I'd expect around 1,4M in 2023 and 2M+ in 2024 from Texas and Berlin. Additionally, Shanghai has continued to ramp up and is now approaching a run rate of 900,000 by itself, while Fremont is still around a 500,000 run rate.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The numbers**\n\nPutting all of the information from the previous section together, I had created a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024; however, after Q1 Tesla has already significantly surpassed my best case scenarios. Below, I will update my Best Case scenarios while leaving the Worst Case untouched. While I do think the likelihood of the Worst Case occurring has decreased significantly, it is still a small possibility.\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|1,900,000|\n|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|3,000,000|\n|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|3,700,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nLast time I mentioned ASPs would likely increase, but chose to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 to be conservative. After Q1, we know that ASPs did in fact increase significantly, to ~$55,000. With recent price changes in Q1 and continuing strong demand, I expect these to continue to increase to ~$60,000 by 2024.\n\n\n**Revenue**\n\nUpdating the higher ASPs ($55K for 2022, $57.5K for 2023 and $60K for 2024) and delivery projections into a new worst and best case gives us the following numbers:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$70B|$77B|$85B|$105B|\n|**2023**|$100B|$115B|$135B|$173B|\n|**2024**|$130B|$156B|$165B|$222B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nLast time I said:\n\n&gt; Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.\n\nThis is where I was most wrong by far. After Q1, Tesla showed an operating margin of a staggering 19.2%. This already surpassed my best case scenario for 2023. As I don't see margins decreasing throughout the rest of 2022, I will need to significantly increase my expectations for both the worst and best cases:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|14%|19%|14%|22%|\n|**2023**|15%|20%|18%|26%|\n|**2024**|16%|21%|20%|30%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$9,8B|$14.6B|$11,9B|$22.1B|\n|**2023**|$15,0B|$23B|$24,3B|$45.0B|\n|**2024**|$20,8B|$32B|$33,0B|$66.6B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|102|68|84|45|\n|**2023**|67|43|41|22|\n|**2024**|48|31|30|15|\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nAfter Q3, using the $1T market cap I expected Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Only two quarters later, Tesla was able to beat the expectations (of what some would consider a \"delusional Tesla bull\") by such a large amount, that my new expectations are for it to be trading at a PE of between 15 and 31 by 2024 should the market cap stay flat at $1T.\n\nDepending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock now only has between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is how, even in the worst case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($23B in net income compared to Toyota's $21B). In the best case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.\n\nSo to reiterate, the popular sentiment that \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" is false.\n\n**Important side note**\n\nFor simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid \"FSD doesn't exist\", \"energy is a scam\" and \"the Bot will never work\" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tesla managed to beat all expectations by such an insane margin that based on the current trends, they now only have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.",

As I don&amp;#39;t see margins decreasing throughout the rest of 2022, I will need to significantly increase my expectations for both the worst and best cases:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Previous Worst Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;New Worst Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Previous Best Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;New Best Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;19%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;22%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;18%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;26%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;30%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Previous Worst Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;New Worst Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Previous Best Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;New Best Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$9,8B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$14.6B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$11,9B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$22.1B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$15,0B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$23B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$24,3B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$45.0B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$20,8B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$32B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$33,0B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$66.6B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P/E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Previous Worst Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;New Worst Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Previous Best Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;New Best Case&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;102&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;68&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;84&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;43&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;41&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Q3, using the $1T market cap I expected Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Only two quarters later, Tesla was able to beat the expectations (of what some would consider a &amp;quot;delusional Tesla bull&amp;quot;) by such a large amount, that my new expectations are for it to be trading at a PE of between 15 and 31 by 2024 should the market cap stay flat at $1T.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock now only has between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also worth mentioning is how, even in the worst case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($23B in net income compared to Toyota&amp;#39;s $21B). In the best case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to reiterate, the popular sentiment that &amp;quot;Tesla has decades of growth priced in&amp;quot; is false.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important side note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla&amp;#39;s automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla&amp;#39;s future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid &amp;quot;FSD doesn&amp;#39;t exist&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;energy is a scam&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the Bot will never work&amp;quot; kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Tesla managed to beat all expectations by such an insane margin that based on the current trends, they now only have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
