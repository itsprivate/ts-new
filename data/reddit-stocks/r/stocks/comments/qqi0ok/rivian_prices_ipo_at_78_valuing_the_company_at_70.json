The all-electric truck maker had filed to offer 135 million shares at [$57 to $62](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amazon-backed-rivian-to-go-public-next-week-51635855897?mod=article_inline).

Morgan are the lead underwriters on the deal. \n\nRivian is valued at nearly $70 billion based on the 873.1 million shares outstanding if the underwriters exercise the so-called greenshoe. (The greenshoe allows underwriters on a deal to buy shares in the IPO at the offer price.)\n\nRivian’s near $70 billion valuation would surpass the market capitalization of [Honda Motor ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/hmc?mod=article_inline)(ticker: HMC), which ended Tuesday with a $51 billion market cap, bringing Rivian closer to [Ford Motor ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/f?mod=article_inline)(F), an investor in Rivian, whose valuation was $80 billion. [General Motors ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gm)(GM) had an $85.1 billion market cap Tuesday. \n\nFounded in 2009, Rivian makes all-electric pickup trucks and SUVs.
