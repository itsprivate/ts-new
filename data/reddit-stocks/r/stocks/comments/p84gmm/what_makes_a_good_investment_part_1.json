  "selftext": "A few days ago I made a post called [*The Biggest Misconception about Investing*](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p62wp3/the_biggest_misconception_about_investing/) where I talked about how a lot of everyday investors make decisions without understanding what investing is and what they’re investing in. I delved into how investing has been misconstrued as speculation and encouraged readers to think like a landlord who collects rent every month to get better at investing. Ultimately, the moral of the story was: don’t buy a stock because you think it’s going to go up, but because its future earnings will exceed what you paid for.\n\nSince then, a few of you have asked me to share how do I figure out if a company and its stock is a good investment. Here's my explanation:\n\n# Key Takeaways:\n\n* A company is a good investment if they earn and can continue to earn more than what they’re selling for. The greater the earnings are compared to the price, the better the investment.\n* A moat is a distinct and structural advantage a company has that is difficult to replicate and are what allows a company to earn lots of money. The stronger the moat, the more money it earns.\n* The longer you hold a company with a strong moat, the better your return on investment will be.\n* Identifying a moat is not rocket science — understand how the company makes money, figure out why consumers prefer their products over their competitors, and cross-reference your hypothesis with a few key numbers.\n\n## A company is a good investment if it can significantly earn more than what it’s selling for\n\nAn investment is a decision based on the assumption that my investment will produce more than what I paid for it. A company is, by definition, a good investment if its future earnings will exceed what I paid for it by a considerable margin. The more a company earns and the longer a company earns, the greater the margin becomes. The wider the margin, the better the investment. This post deals with the first part of the equation: How do I know if a company will make lots of money?\n\n## How do I know if a company will earn a lot of money?\n\nPredicting which companies are going to earn lots of money and which companies come down to whether or not customers buy their products or not. To figure out if customers prefer a particular company, the company must have a distinct advantage over its competitors that is difficult to replicate. This is known as a moat.\n\n## Moats: Focus on what makes a company better\n\nThe term \"economic moat\" was coined by Warren Buffett. Think about a castle that is surrounded by a deep trench, a moat, filled with water. The moat acts to protect the castle from invaders, and the bigger the moat, the less of a chance attackers have of getting across the moat!\n\nMoats, in the context of investing, allows a company to outearn and fend off its competitors for as long as the moat is intact. Just like a castle, the wider and deeper these moats are, the harder it is for competitors to replicate, the less of a chance they have of seizing market share.\n\n## Companies with moats make money efficiently\n\nA good way to think about moats is how much capital and effort a company has to invest in order to achieve the same amount of earnings as its competitors. If a company has a strong moat, it really doesn’t have to do much to earn money and vice versa.\n\nStarbucks is a good example here. If I offered you a caramel latte that is made up of mostly ice and milk with a touch of pumpkin spice and costs about $0.89 to make, would you pay $5.00 or 5.6x its cost? I certainly wouldn’t. But put a green mermaid on the cup, and suddenly I’m not only willing to buy it, but I’m also waiting in line for it. It costs the same for any other company to make the drink, so why aren’t they charging $5.00 a cup? Well, because it doesn’t have a green mermaid on it.\n\nThe example I just made might sound ridiculous, but it is not. It is a testament to Starbucks’ wide moats found in its premium and instantly recognizable brand. Companies with strong moats can make more for less, which is another way of saying earnings.\n\n## Moat archetypes\n\nWhile Moats come in different shapes and sizes, they can be categorized into five distinct archetypes: Intangible assets, Network effects, Switching cost, Low-cost producer, and Toll moats (natural monopolies). [Here](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/morningstar-wide-moat-etf-moat/what-makes-a-moat-white-paper.pdf/) is a more comprehensive explanation of the five different types.\n\n## How do I identify a moat?\n\nWhile identifying a moat isn’t an exact science, it also isn’t rocket science. I try to keep it as simple as possible by breaking it down into 3 distinct steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the company**\n\nYou don’t have to understand everything at first, but you should be able to answer these questions and ideally write them down before moving on to the next step. If you can’t answer the questions, don’t understand the answer to the questions, or are not in the least a bit excited by what the company does that’s perfectly fine, but you should move on to a different company.\n\n* How does the company make money?\n* What products/services are the cash cows for the company?\n* What industries does the company operate in?\n* Who are the biggest players in the industry?\n* What is the company doing now to improve the value of its products/services?\n\n**Step 2: Figure out what sets the company apart**\n\nOnce you figure out what the company does, move on its moats and how strong they are. Again, you should be able to answer these questions before moving on to the next question and ultimately investing.\n\n* How much more or less do people spend on this company’s product versus its competitor?\n* If they spend more on this company, why? i.e What type of moat is might this company have?\n* How difficult or likely would it be for competitors to replicate it’s moats? If it is easy to replicate, then it is a short-lived advantage, not a moat.\n\n**Step 3: Support your claims with facts**\n\nMake sure the numbers reflect your hypothesis. Ultimately a company with wide moats will earn more than its competitors so you got to make sure that is the case. Here are three numbers that should be growing consistently. While these aren’t the only numbers that can indicate if a company has a moat or not, a company with a strong moat will have strong numbers across these metrics. Anything above 15% growth and ROIC a year over 5, 10, 15 years can be considered a strong moat. The bigger and longer the growth, the stronger the moat.\n\n* Revenue — how much the company sells in a period\n* Book value per share + dividends — how much the company is worth\n* Return on invested capital — how efficiently is the company growing\n\n## Moats generate earnings\n\nUltimately if a company has a strong moat, it will translate into large earnings. If you own a piece of that company, you own a piece of those earnings. By identifying moats you turn away from speculation and wishful thinking and move towards reason and logic. In other words, identifying a moat allows you to figure out why and how this company will make money for a long time.\n\nThose earnings will either be paid back in the form of dividends or share buybacks today or reinvested back into the business so you can earn even more money tomorrow. Bottom line: the more pieces you own, and the longer you own them for, the more money you make.\n\n*This post was all about figuring out what kinds of companies earn lots of money. The next part will deal with valuation. In other words, how do I know if the company is selling for the right price relative to it’s earnings.*",
