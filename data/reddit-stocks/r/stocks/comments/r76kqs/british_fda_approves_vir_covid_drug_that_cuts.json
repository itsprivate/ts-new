By targeting a highly conserved region of the spike protein that is less likely to mutate, we hoped to address both the current Sars-CoV-2 virus and future variants that we expected would be inevitable\"\n\n* MHRA: \"**It is too early** to know whether the Omicron variant has any impact on sotrovimab's effectiveness but the MHRA will work with the company to establish this.\"\n\n* VIR &amp; GSK say early tests show the drug \"**retains activity** against key mutations of the new Omicron variant.\"\n\n* The drug is a 30 minute treatment.\n\nI say \"may work against Omicron\" because it really depends on what $VIR means by \"retains activity.\" That sounds like a technical term so if anyone here is a medical researcher who knows what that means please chime in. \n\nIs $VIR an investment opportunity? The bull case:\n\n* Obviously if it works vs Omicron it may blow up. It's already up 14% today.\n\n* Even before today's news US has already [ordered $1 billion](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/united-states-signs-about-1-bln-order-gsk-vir-covid-19-antibody-drug-2021-11-17/) worth of this drug in mid November. \n\n* It is already authorized for emergency use in US. EU approval is pending (not sure about EU).\n\n* $VIR [claims](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/gsk-vir-covid-19-antibody-muscle-injection-effective-intravenous-shot-2021-11-12/) this therapy may also work as a shot in the arm \n\nIs $VIR worth investing in? The Bear case:\n\n* Why did it go up as high $83 in January? Why is it down in the dumps at $50 right now? What happened. \n\n* $VIR is a one-trick pony. Unlike Moderna which has lots of other things in its pipeline.\n\n* This therapy sounds promising, but if Pfizer delivers their drug (which promises 89% and can be taken at home) and it also works against Omicron then would $VIR be anything special?\n\nIs it possible that both $VIR and $PFE are worth investing in because there's going to be a huge roadblock in production so they won't really be competing against each other? I'm trading Pfizer and VIR but not sure what to do here.",
