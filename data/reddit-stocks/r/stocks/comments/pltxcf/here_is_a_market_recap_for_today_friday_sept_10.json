  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 10, 2021**\n\nStocks extended their streak of underperformance, with the three major indexes falling once again for the fifth consecutive day of losses, one of the worst weeks for equities all year. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.78% down, closing out the week 1.57% down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also closed the day 0.78% down, closing the week out 1.3%. The Dow Jones (DIA), which primarily weights financial, industrial, and energy stocks, closed the day 0.75%, closing the week 1.91% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its roughly year-long streak of underperformance, falling 0.97% and closing the week 2.53% lower. All year, IWM has been trading between a range of $210 and $235, unable to break out, compared to the more than 15% year-to-date gain by the SPY. Market participants remain concerned with the surge in the coronavirus Delta variant and the potential negative impact it could cause the economy.\n\nFirst off, in geopolitical news, President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in months. Afterward, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was considering investigating Chinese subsidies and their effect on the US economy. Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said “The Sino-America relationship is in disrepair and today’s call does not seem to change this. The US appears to list actions it wants China to take, while China’s demands seem minimalist, quit demonizing it and respect its red lines. Yet its red lines strike at the very heart of international order, such as its claims on most of the South China Sea and its aggressive provocative actions in the region.” This also comes amid extremely intense regulatory pressures by the CCP on Chinese tech stocks, many of which have an American listing.\n\nIn other news, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. \n\nMike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, “Anyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this won’t be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind we’re still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.”\n\nNow, this is absolutely massive news and will have huge consequences in the market moving forward, especially for companies who derive a large percentage of their revenue through the Apple Store. Today,  a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apple’s 15-30% commission. Stocks like Roblox (RBLX), Bumble (BMBL), Zynga (ZNGA), and Spotify (SPOT) sharply gapped up after the announcement. I cannot stress how big this is, in 2020 Apple made $73 billion in revenue from the commission on App purchases.\n\nUnfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. \n\nThis weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Peloton (PTON) shares gapped up after the company announced it was launching an apparel brand. It’s probably gonna be the same sort of clothes that are sold in Lululemon (LULU).\n* The crackdown in China continues… This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were “urged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.\n* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflare’s was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.\n* The Italian Data Authority asks Facebook (FB) to provide clarifications on the use and function of the smart glasses to gauge whether the product is compliant with privacy laws. Like I said yesterday, I think the glasses are a bad product, don’t see any use for them apart from very niche uses, like live-streaming. Not even to mention FB’s absolutely appalling record when it comes to data privacy (remember Cambridge Analytica?)\n* Sales of cars in China fell for the fourth straight month amid the global shortage in semiconductors that have forced automakers across the globe to slash production.\n* Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla employees asking them to “go super hardcore” to make up for production challenges to “ensure a decent Q3 delivery number.” The CEO also said, “This is the biggest wave in Tesla history, but we got to get it done.” I hope they get it done, still waiting on my Model 3 :(\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with two target raises. Stock currently around $341\n   * Morgan Stanley from $330 to $380 at Overweight\n   * Bank of America from $324 to $379 at Buy\n* Shares of Affirm (AFRM) gapped up 34% after the company absolutely demolished earnings and raises guidance. Also received a host of target upgrades, with average price target being $140 at Buy.\n* Caesars Entertainment (CZR) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $125 at Outperform. Stock currently around $104\n* Danaher (DHR) target raised by Bank of America from $340 to $360 at Buy. Stock currently around $330\n* Lululemon (LULU) target raised by Argus from $416 to $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $425\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) with two target raises. Stock currently around $470\n   * Royal Bank of Canada from $475 to $525 at Outperform\n   * BMO Capital Markets from $480 to $525 at Outperform\n* QuantaServices (PWR) target raised by Cowen from $110 to $130 at Outperform. Stock currently around $115\n* Zscaler (ZS) with a host of target raises after beating earnings. Average price target $320 at Buy. Stock currently around $270. \n\n“To Bear Trials with a Calm Mind Robs Misfortune of its Strength & Burden” - Seneca",
