Cheniere inked its latest GSA with Tourmaline in July. Under the deals, Cheniere buys natural gas at prices linked to JKM, subjecting it to commodity price fluctuations that its LNG buyers typically assume under long-term offtake agreements.”\n\n\nCheniere is doing the exact opposite of what they SHOULD be doing! They are blessed to have a business in an industry that could profit from a crazy US (Henry hub) to Europe (TTF)/ Asia (JKM) arbitrage. Right now, Henry Hub is $5 and JKM/TTF are both over $25!!! \n\nWhy in the world are they SOURCING gas and paying based on JKM prices???? Its crazy!\n\nSo I’ll stick with the high risk/ high reward $TELL play. The Driftwood project is becoming more of a reality every day that passes and when we are up and running, we will be integrated- controlling costs by owning our own upstream assets and SELLING at JKM/TTF linked pricing (not buying at jkm/ttf like cheniere….mind boggling)",
