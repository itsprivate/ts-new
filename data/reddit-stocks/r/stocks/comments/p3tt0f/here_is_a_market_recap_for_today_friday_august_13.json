  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 13, 2021**\n\nStocks rose modestly in another very choppy session, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) narrowly eking out fresh intraday record highs. The Nasdaq (QQQ) remain just a tick below its previous all-time high. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings data and new economic reports.\n\nYesterday’s Weekly Unemployment report showed a third straight drop in filings, an encouraging sign that the recovery in the labor market continues. The report showed new unemployment claims coming in at 375,000, in-line with analyst estimates. Continuing claims came in at 2.866 million, better than the 2.9 million expected and 2.980 million the week prior. \n\nThe Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June’s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nCore CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June’s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June’s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it’s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It’s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. \n\nOn the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The producer price index for final demand increased at a 7.8% pace for the 12 months ended July, according to the Labor Department. The July print was faster than the 7.3% pace recorded in June and ahead of the 7.3% rate expected. Prices rose 1% in July, matching the increase in June and higher than the 0.6% increase expected. \n\nEarlier in the week, the US Senate passed the $1 trillion infrastructure deal in a surprisingly bipartisan manner. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, “This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you’ve been asking for for a long, long time.” Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared “100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration” said of the deal, “I was proud to support today’s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.” The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc have asked the U.S. government for approval to operate a new undersea data cable between the Philippines and California after China Mobile agreed to exit the plan, a government agency said Friday. The companies told the Federal Communications Commission they intend to start commercial operation by late 2022 and said the new data connection will \"provide significant new capacity on routes where capacity demand continues to increase substantially each year.\"\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) gapped up 5% premarket before losing steam throughout the session to close roughly 1% higher\n* Tesla (TSLA) battery supplier CATL said it plans to sell $9 billion in stock to help boost manufacturing capacity. \n* So far, 91% of S&P 500 components have reported actual second-quarter earnings, with 87% of these having topped Wall Street's estimates, according to data from FactSet. Assuming this proportion holds through the end of earnings season, it would mark the greatest share of earnings beats ever recorded in FactSet data spanning back to 2008. \n* Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell once again after founder Sir Richard Branson disclosed that he sold more than 10 million shares for about $300 million. His remaining stake is 46 million shares, roughly $1.2 billion.\n* Prices for [U.S. imports increased](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-import-price-increases-slow-125204156.html) at a slower than expected rate in July, signaling that supply chain constraints may have begun to ease as the economic recovery continued. \n* Import prices rose 0.3% in July compared to June, Commerce Department data showed on Friday. This was well below the 0.6% rise expected, and slowed notably from June's 1.0% monthly increase. \n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Airbnb (ABNB) with four price target increases following earnings.
