I’m a researcher in my (boring) day job and like to put my skills to the test in the Gambling and Gaming area\n* How? Investor presentations, earning transcripts, reading between the lines and the occasional message to those in the know\n* What? Deep dives with a focus on hidden facts and opportunities. \n* How much: 188 shares \n\nRev/Net Loss figures of interest:\n\n* 2021 revenue - $1.15bn (predicted)\n* 2020 revenue - $614.5m\n* 2019 revenue - $323m\n* 2018 revenue - $226m\n* 2017 revenue - $191.8 (Pre-PASPA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 2021 net loss - unknown\n* 2020 net loss - $850m ($1.2bn if include extra items)\n* 2019 net loss - $147m\n* 2018 net loss - $76m\n* 2017 net loss - $73m\n\nIn Q1 of 2021, DKNG posted $323m - a 175% YoY growth for Q1 and matched their entire 2021 revenue. So, they’re on a good trajectory, but we can only believe in a $30/40bn valuation if they can get to at least $4bn revenue and become a profitable company in no more than five years. \n\nBut let’s examine their claims from their most recent earnings\\] presentation and [Investor Day Presentation](https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/events/event-details/draftkings-investor-day) and see if even $3bn is possible.\n\nStatement 1: Our latest estimate of the US OSB is $22bn at 100% legalization\n\nThis is more than reasonable based on GDP and Population methods. Let’s look at New Jersey which is scheduled to generate $800m in Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) in 2021. Goldman Sachs predict an 11% CAGR, so just based off NJ, they will be at $2bn by 2031 and NJ is just 3% of the population (albeit with many NYers betting in NJ). As of now, just 27% of the population has access to legalized OSB. \n\nStatement 2: iGaming is tracking to be at least a $40B market in the U.S. at 100% legalization\n\nAgain, they cite the example of NJ at $1bn in Igaming in 2020. Based on extrapolation, the market is worth at least $37bn. I am skeptical here on the growth relative to OSB. \n\nStatement 3: Canadian OSB and iGaming TAM of $5B to $8B is a meaningful upside opportunity\n\nNow this is somewhat of a stretch as we simply don’t know Canada’s appetite for OSB or iGaming. [PwC estimates](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/50217/single-game-canada-sports-betting-revenue-report/) between $1.5B & $2.4B for OSB slightly lower than DKNG’s $2-3B\n\nStatement 4: \n\n**OSB**\n\n$22B - Implied Total U.S. Market\n\n65% of U.S. Population with Legalized OSB\n\n20-30% DraftKings’ OSB Market Share\n\n= $2.9-4.3B in Gross OSB Revenue\n\n**iGaming**\n\n$40B Implied Total U.S. Market\n\n30% of U.S. Population with Legalized iGaming\n\n15-20% DraftKings’ iGaming Market Share\n\n$1.8-2.4B in Gross iGaming Revenue\n\n**Canada** \n\n$5B Implied Total Canadian Market\n\n64% of Canada Population with\n\nLegalized OSB and iGaming 10-20%\n\nDraftKings’ Canada Market Share\n\n$300mm-600mm in Gross OSB and iGaming Revenue\n\n= $5-7.3B in Gross Gaming Revenue\n\nSo do we believe them? I think they’re close enough to reasonable expectations although the legalization roadmap is a huge unknown. NY might not do it right; Florida may never legalize; California is long overdue and Texas might still be years away. OSB at 65% is a good target and I’ll give them it. The lobbying behind blocking legalization has slowed down and it’s only the tribes heavily objecting. I also believe in DKNG’s market share which stands at 30%. I don’t think it can increase due to the competition, but 20% is also too low considering all the great work (and spending) and the UX of their incredible website. $3.5bn OSB GGR just works. \n\nRegarding their iGaming, they have gone for lower estimates, but due to the enormous competition, I am chopping this to just $1bn. Their market share is just 19% now and I haven’t seen anything to suggest this will increase. \n\nAnd for Canada, I will take a half-way split PwC and DKNG (for sports) as it is such an unknown \n\nSo we have a total DKNG estimated GGR of $4.8B, but by when? It all depends on the legalization of both OSB and iGaming. They don’t say but this TAM figure is likely to be for 2026 as on page 30 they discuss a 5 year plan. 1.15 → 4.8 \\^ 5 years = CAGR of 33.9% which compares nicely with their CAGR from 2017 to 2021 of 42.7%.\n\nIn fact, on page 39, DKNG are aiming for $3bn Gross Profit and $1.7bn Adjusted EBITDA. \n\nWould a 2026 $4.8bn Revenue/$1.7bn Adjusted EBITDA/$1bn Net Income be worthy of a $100 stock price i.e. a valuation of $40bn? 8.33 revenue multiple and 40x EBITDA multiple doesn’t sound too bad for a company that keeps its promises?\n\nSo the big question is whether they can continue to grow > 30% CAGR without the incredible spending on costs (mostly marketing).\n\nI guess I should cover that in part II if folks are interested (hint: they can). I would also add a description of all their competitors from what I can find: 888sport, bet365, BetRivers Sportsbook, Betfred, BetMGM, Barstool Sportsbook, BetAmerica, Caesars, DraftKings Daily Fantasy, DraftKings Sportsbook, Elite Sportsbook, FanDuel Sportsbook, FOX Bet, Golden Nugget, Hard Rock Sportsboo, Oregon Lottery Scoreboard, PointsBet, Resorts Sportsbook, SportsBetting.com, Unibet, William Hill\n\nWhat do y’all think?",
