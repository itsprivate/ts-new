It is somehow clear to everyone that things are bad and are going to get much, much worse.  That sort of sentiment makes me think we are in for a rally.  When markets have been on the edge of an actual cliff before, the prevailing view was things wouldn't get that bad, valuations weren't too crazy, known risks were less serious than some thought, etc.\n\nMy view: The economy is stronger than some people believe, we don't have a recession, oil prices won't go as high as some think and the sell off will be viewed as a buying opportunity in retrospect.  There are still some stocks that I think will fall further (no- or low-earnings tech), but significant parts of the market are not particularly expensive relative to earnings, especially when interest rates are accounted for.
