  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Inside of SpaceX, most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink, which will provide FIXED-POINT broadband to customers, albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality.</p>\n\n<p>Just like Facebook found out after it&#39;s IPO, the real market is and always will be in MOBILE.  Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish.</p>\n\n<p>$ASTS AST Spacemobile has re-imagined what&#39;s possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch, which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be, $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites.  This allows the satellite to do the work, not the phone</li>\n<li>By innovating with software, $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE networks by only working with the carriers&#39; ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect; importantly, ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here is the overview:</p>\n\n<p><strong>PRODUCT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and <strong>only</strong> space-based cellular broadband network that is <strong>direct-to-device</strong>; a consumer’s existing handset will work with ASTS’s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices</p>\n\n<p>• The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks</p>\n\n<p>• The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user’s device</p>\n\n<p><strong>MARKET:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G   market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g.   towers) is less developed</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular   trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii)   broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband   and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not   connected</p>\n\n<p>• Key regional opportunities include India,   Africa, and Equatorial regions</p>\n\n<p>• The service is well-suited for low/medium   density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters</p>\n\n<p><strong>MANAGEMENT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016)</p>\n\n<p>• The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK,   Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs</p>\n\n<p><strong>COMPETITION:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• ASTS competes with high-cost legacy   providers, including Iridium • Legacy satellite providers require unique  handsets for users to connect</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS also competes with the build-out of   standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment • Competitor Lynk advertises a   similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to   commercial, financial and technical milestones</p>\n\n<p><strong>OTHER:</strong>   Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all of whom recently invested in the Company&#39;s latest financing</p>\n\n<p><strong>TIMELINE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• April 2019 – BW 1 was launched, validating system architecture • 2H   2021E will launch BW3 • 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches   of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and   168 satellites by YE 2024</p>\n\n<p><strong>ANALYSIS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• ASTS is an exciting event-driven story  stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven   entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and <em>bone fide</em> strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business</p>\n\n<p>• Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and ‘skin in the game’</p>\n\n<p>• Targeting mobile 5G is a ‘<strong>big idea</strong>’ that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players  such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are   likely to be present in developing markets</p>\n\n<p>• The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and  discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU</p>\n\n<p>• The investment set-up is favorable since a   high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets,  yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market – the set-up is not a   ‘foist’ by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but   instead a legitimate capital raising exercise that harnessed the SPAC market   instead of exploiting it</p>\n\n<p>• With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float on account of the small   trust size ($232MM) coupled with the statement of confidence from pre-deal   and PIPE investors that rolled over in what amounted to a “public Series C”   financing</p>\n\n<p>• Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will   see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company</p>\n\n<p><strong>RISKS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>• While the <em>BlueWalker</em> satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed</p>\n\n<p>• Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement</p>\n\n<p>• Realized user penetration and ARPU remain   uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution</p>\n\n<p>• ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is   susceptible to potential funding risk</p>\n\n<p><strong>INVESTMENT CHECKLIST:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BUSINESS MODEL</em></strong>:  • ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split   with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT&amp;T; given its large,   fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA   margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>GO-TO-MARKET</em></strong>:  • In-place binding agreements with carriers provide   ASTS with access to &gt;1.3BN existing customers without having to   independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of   churn) • Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions   and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America –   the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>DEFENSIBILITY</em></strong>:  • ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a   first-mover advantage • Commercial progress reinforces the   Company’s technical lead in the market</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>CAPITAL</em></strong>:  • ASTS is capital intensive and subject to   capital availability to complete its full system • Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme   operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>TRACTION</em></strong>:  • ASTS appears to have extraordinary   commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user   uptake the usage will be • Technical traction was ‘proved’ by the   April 2019 launch of the <em>Bluewalker 1</em> test satellite</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>FINANCIALS</em></strong>:  With a market cap of ~$1.8bn, the company is expected to generate &gt;$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user</p>\n\n<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY DETAILS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>OVERVIEW</em></strong>: AST &amp; Science (“ASTS”) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BOOMBOX IN SPACE</em></strong>: ASTS’ satellites are ~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a 900-square meter array, the system is a large <strong>“loud”</strong> system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>SOFTWARE</em></strong>**:** ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks. The “magic” of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BACKHAUL</em></strong>: Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>CAPACITY</em></strong>:   Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>WHAT DO WE KNOW:</em></strong>  What has ASTS done to prove its system?</p>\n\n<p>o <em>Bluewalker1</em> proved the RF could close (e.g. the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone) and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS’ ‘magic’ software; ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost-effectively check an important element of technical diligence. <em>Bluewalker1</em> allowed for end-to-end connectivity testing, which has been reviewed over the last 1.5 years</p>\n\n<p>o <em>Bluewalker3</em> (2H 2021 launch) will be a scaled version of the system, which will de-risk components and demonstrate the full technology. BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>ENABLEMENT</em></strong>:  The fundamentals of closing an RF connection are known technology. Previously, the launch costs were prohibitive, but the technology was otherwise available for ASTS’ system</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>RISKS</em></strong>:  Most of the risks are timing risks. For instance, <em>Bluewalker3</em> could spur the need to tune microns, which could delay the system deployment by months. The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs</p>\n\n<p>A launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BENT PIPE</em></strong>: The satellite itself is not complex – it is bent pipe in the sky; most of the design relates to distributing power. The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLOSURE</strong>:  I own 500,401 shares of common.  Yes, this is a huge position.  You only live once...invest carefully and with great vision</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
