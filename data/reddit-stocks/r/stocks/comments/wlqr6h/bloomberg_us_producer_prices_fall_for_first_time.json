The pullback was entirely due to a decline in the costs of goods, though services prices only edged up.\n&gt; Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called **core PPI rose 0.2%** from **June** and 7.6% from a year earlier. **Both the overall and core figures were softer than forecast.**\n&gt; \n&gt; The figures suggest some pipeline inflationary pressures are beginning to ease. Commodity prices, including oil, have dropped sharply in recent months, and there are indications that supply-chain conditions are improving. \n&gt; \n&gt; Consumer-price data out Wednesday also showed a welcome moderation in inflation in July, largely reflecting a pullback in prices at the pump. Even so, inflation remains stubbornly high and will likely keep the Federal Reserve on an aggressive path to curb it.\n&gt; Goods Prices\n&gt; \n&gt; **Some 80% of the decline in goods prices was due to a 16.7% plunge in gasoline prices,** the report showed. **Diesel, iron and steel scrap and grains also decreased**.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Services prices rose just 0.1% in July**, led by an increase in fuel margins and transportation and warehousing. Meanwhile, prices for portfolio management, food and alcohol retailing and long-distance trucking declined.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thursday’s report adds to separate data from S&amp;P Global and regional Fed banks that showed a pullback in prices paid for inputs like materials in July. \n&gt; \n&gt; Risks remain, however. While supply chains have started normalizing, the war in Ukraine, labor negotiations at West Coast ports and China’s zero-Covid policy represent potential logistics speed bumps for US producers. \n\n&gt; Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- which strips out the most volatile components of the index -- increased 0.2% from June and 5.8% from a year earlier**\n&gt; Costs of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, slumped 2.3% -- the most since April 2020. More than half of the drop was attributable to a plunge in diesel costs. Excluding foods and energy, these costs dropped 0.2%.\n\n[Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-11/us-producer-prices-fall-for-first-time-since-early-in-pandemic?srnd=premium)\n\nOther snippets from CNBC:\n\n&gt; Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been **expecting an increase of 0.2%**\n\n&gt; On an **annual** basis, the index rose 9.8%, **the lowest rate since October 2021.** That compares to an **11.1% [year over year] increase in June** and the record **11.6%  [year over year] gain in March**\n\n&gt; [This is] the first month-over-month decrease since April 2020, the month after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic\n\n&gt; Most of the decline came from **energy**, which **declined 9% at the wholesale level**.
