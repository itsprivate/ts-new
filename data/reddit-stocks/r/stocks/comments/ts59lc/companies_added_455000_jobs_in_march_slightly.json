  "selftext": "Companies added jobs at a solid pace in March,  indicating that hiring is strong despite signs of a tightening labor  market, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.\n\nPrivate  payrolls expanded by 455,000 for the month, the firm said, about in line  with the Dow Jones estimate of 450,000 though it was the lowest since  August 2021. The total was slightly below the upwardly revised 486,000  in February, and brought ADP’s first-quarter jobs count to 1.45 million.\n\nThe  report comes two days before the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls  report, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics expected to show jobs growth  of 490,000 for the month, according to the Dow Jones consensus  estimate. The ADP and BLS numbers can differ widely, as they did in  February when the payrolls firm’s count was about 200,000 below the  government’s official tally.\n\nADP’s report for March indicated that  hiring was spread evenly around sectors, with leisure and hospitality  adding 166,000 to lead the way. Education and health services  contributed 72,000 while professional and business services was next  with 61,000 new jobs.\n\nOn the goods-producing side, manufacturing led with 54,000 while construction added 15,000.\n\nService-providing companies added 377,000 jobs while goods producers made up the balance of about 79,000.\n\nBy  size, job gains also were spread fairly evenly, with companies  employing 50 to 499 workers up 188,000 and large companies adding  177,000. Small business, which saw a decline in February, reversed that  and added 90,000 in March.\n\n“Businesses  are hiring, specifically among the service providers which had the most  ground to make up due to early pandemic losses,” said Nela Richardson,  chief economist at ADP. “However, a tight labor supply remains an  obstacle for continued growth in consumer-facing industries.”\n\nIndeed, in February there were [a record 5 million more jobs](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/29/there-are-now-a-record-5-million-more-job-openings-than-unemployed-people-in-the-us.html)  than available workers, according to BLS data released Wednesday.  Workers continue to leave their jobs in search of better opportunities,  with 4.3 million more taking part in the so-called Great Resignation  during the month.\n\nFriday’s report is expected to show the unemployment rate contracted further, to 3.7%.\n\nFederal  Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as the central  bank battles inflation at 40-year highs. Job growth has come with a  sharp acceleration in wages, and the Fed is expected to raise interest  rates at a brisk pace this year to combat rising prices.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/30/adp-march-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/30/adp-march-2022.html)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nConsidering this, what are everyone's thoughts for the non-farm payroll numbers releasing tomorrow?",
