  "selftext": "TL;DR - Oil isn't anywhere near it's death throes and provides more upside IMO than the broader market\n\nEdit - And of course, this should not be construed as legitimate financial advice\n\nI saw a post recently asking why people were long oil given that it's a declining industry.  In the spirit of transparency, I am long a few of the more conservatively valued oil stocks (BP, EPD, ENB, KMI, and the broader XLE) which make up about 10% of my actively managed portfolio.\n\nMy belief is that these stocks will outperform over the short- and medium-term periods (I'm looking at 1-5 years).  The reason that I am bullish on these stocks and think they will outperform the broader market include:\n\n1. Demand-side concerns are too bearish\n2. Supply-side concerns are being ignored\n3. Inflation\n4. Multiple expansion vs. contraction\n\nI think that oil stocks will outperform the broader S&amp;P 500 over the next 5 years by a margin of about 1.7 percentage points (this is total, not the CAGR).  This is based on assuming a 7.5% CAGR for the S&amp;P 500 (including all dividends) vs. a 3.5% CAGR in oil stock prices and a 5% dividend reinvested into the S&amp;P 500.\n\nEdit - What this means is that if I invested $1,000 into the S&amp;P 500 and $1,000 in oil, my forecast is that at the end of 5 years, the S&amp;P 500 investment would be worth about $1,436 and the oil investment would be worth $1,460--so, accounting for inflation, about enough to treat your wife and her boyfriend to Burger King)\n\nThis may not sound like much, but most people don't beat the market most years--in fact, most people do substantially worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Demand-Side Concerns----------------------------------------------**\n\nI first want to call out that the long-term trend for oil has been an increase in daily consumption around the globe and it is forecasted to recover from the 2020-2022 lulls in consumption over the next few years as the pandemic subsides (hopefully).  Oil demand is not in some massive decline ([Global oil demand 2006-2026 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271823/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006/)).\n\nAdditionally, I think that the big \"nail-in-the-coffin\" for oil is supposed to be the Electric Vehicle (EV).  This may be true since about 70% of oil is used for transportation, but I think that people are about a generation off.\n\n* The EIA doesn't project peak for traditional combustion engines until nearly 2040 ([Electric vehicles projected to make up 31% of the global fleet by 2050 (electrek.co](https://electrek.co/2021/10/26/electric-vehicles-projected-to-make-up-31-of-the-global-fleet-by-2050/)).\n* Even sources that are pushing for EV adoption estimate that by 2030, EV sales will only make up 30% of total new car sales ([EV Sales Forecasts – EVAdoption](https://evadoption.com/ev-sales/ev-sales-forecasts/))\n\nFor my time horizon (1-5 years), I do not see the demand for oil collapsing, rather, I see it growing at a modest pace.  Given how short-term markets really are, I don't see a substantive threat in the next five years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Supply-side concerns-------------------------------------------------**\n\nI'm sure that we all remember in 2020 when the Pandemic hit, short-term oil futures were negative because there was nowhere to store it.  This led to something interesting:  100 oil companies when bankrupt ([Over 100 oil and gas companies went bankrupt in 2020 (houstonchronicle.com](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/More-than-100-oil-and-gas-companies-filed-for-15884538.php)) and the number of active rigs collapse ([U.S. oil &amp; gas rigs in use per month 2021 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109332/us-oil-and-gas-rigs-in-use-covid19/))\n\nThis number is increasing as time goes on, but it is down.  The thing to remember is that these things don't just come on-line in a few weeks.  The drilling may only take 3-4 weeks, but the entire process can take months or years depending on where in the process you start.  This is a rather capital-intensive process, and I don't think we'll see levels approaching prior levels any time soon.\n\nThe other big concern on the supply-side is OPEC (really, we're talking about the Saudis).  They want the price of oil to be high enough that it supports their country's budgets, but low enough that they maintain share (keep US drillers from being active--this puts additional pressure on US drillers operating domestically).  They can move supply up-and-down to a degree to match demand and any big threats to demand will likely be met with cuts that will maintain prices.\n\nNote that this is simply me talking out my ass, but my guess is that the Saudis want to drive oil to the $100/barrel mark while they know US producers are still spinning up and then drive it back down to put them out of business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Inflation--------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nI think oil companies will respond well to inflationary pressures.  If inflation spools up, the price will go up, and oil companies will profit.  They have an elasticity curve that lets them pass on their costs fully because there is no real substitute for their products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Multiple Expansion vs. Contraction----------------------------**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 currently sits at about 30 whereas the XLE is at 17 ([Group Screener - Valuation sector pe (finviz.com)](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=sector&amp;v=120&amp;o=pe)).  Not sure if this is right, but most of my oil stocks have low valuations.  Simply put, I don't think there's too much more room for these to go down in a sane market, nor do I suspect that the S&amp;P 500 has a whole lot more to expand.  So, I'm expecting there to be some multiple expansion over the next few years as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, I think traditional energy is a great investment over the next few years and that the idea that you're guaranteed a capital loss is...silly.",
