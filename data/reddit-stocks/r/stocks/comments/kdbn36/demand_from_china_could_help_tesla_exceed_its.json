Ives sees Tesla surging 56% from current levels to $1,000 a share in his bull case scenario. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;We believe the company is tracking to another strong month of December in China which could be the tipping point to get Musk &amp; Co. to hit/exceed its 500k annual delivery target, an achievement not even on the map for the Street going back to the late spring/summer timeframe,&quot; Ives said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The China growth story is worth at least $100 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this EV penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, along with major battery innovations coming out of Giga 3 and elsewhere throughout the China EV supply chain,&quot; the analyst added.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the awards.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
