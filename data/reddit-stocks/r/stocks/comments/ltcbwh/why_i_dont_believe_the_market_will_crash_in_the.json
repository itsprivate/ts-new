I really can&#39;t see the market crashing before the stimulus or before reopening, however a forward looking market needs something to look forward too, and once the stimulus has passed and we have reopend, that&#39;s when I&#39;d be worried. Also bubble pops always happen after the most ballistic period, I mean the market goes nuts look at dot com, Japan, South sea, And we haven&#39;t seen that yet with this bubble. if you are new I would hold and don&#39;t panic sell, if you are invested for the long term crash or no crash you will do well.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
