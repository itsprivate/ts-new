TDLR and resources used at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are CDNs and Edge Computing?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Before I get into Fastly, I first need to set the stage by defining CDNs and Edge Computing (or else the rest of the post is confusing)</li>\n<li><strong>CDNs are defined as a group of servers that help deliver Internet content,</strong> so even this Reddit post you’re reading right now is delivered to you through a CDN\n\n<ul>\n<li>To put it simply, all else being equal, a good CDN will help something like a web page load really fast while a bad CDN will be slow and cause noticeable lag</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Edge Computing is a relatively new term born out of CDNs</strong> and is a field in which Fastly is one of the primary innovators\n\n<ul>\n<li>For the average person, it may seem like digital data can be transmitted instantaneously, but in actuality, the farther away servers are to a user, the more time it takes for digital data to travel, compute, and be stored</li>\n<li><strong>Edge computing brings computation and data storage as close to the user as possible through small, distributed data centers placed all over the world</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It also allows for a lot of the data processing to happen on edge devices, like smartphones</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>To really hammer this home, imagine having to travel to Texas every time your car needed gas instead of just traveling to your nearest gas station\n\n<ul>\n<li>That’s the difference between how data used to be processed (traveling to Texas = data traveling to a few, faraway data centers) to what edge computing now provides (nearest gas station = closest edge server or devise)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cbi-research-portal-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/01/08144511/Edge-Computing-Graphic-768x432.png\">Here’s a visual representation I find helpful</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The History of Fastly</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fastly was founded by Artur Bergman in 2011. He was previously the CTO at Wikia. Artur became frustrated with the capabilities of CDNs around 2010 due to the long wait times it took for updates and the constant reliance on slow technical support.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Artur believed he could create a better solution and thus founded Fastly and the company branded itself around CDNs until about 2017, when references to CDNs were replaced with moving computing to the edge</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>What’s important to know is that from its early beginnings, <strong>Fastly’s team had a fundamentally different mindset and a custom-built approach</strong> that know gave the company an edge</li>\n<li>Here are 3 notable differentiators:\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1) Silverton - Fastly’s customized distributed routing agent</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In its beginnings, the Fastly team first examined approaches to handling networking traffic into and out of their Points of Presence, or POPs, which are a collection of devices that store data that CDNs can pull from to quickly deliver content</li>\n<li>Instead of using standard, off-the-shelf equipment, Fastly purchased Arista switches that allowed them to run their own software aka Silverton which gave Fastly more control over traffic routing and thus leading to better content delivery</li>\n<li>This also saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars for each POP deployed</li>\n<li>But more importantly, software can be changed while hardware cannot, which means that over time, Silverton becomes better and a stronger competitive edge</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>2) Less but more powerful POPs</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most legacy CDN companies like Akamai have invested into hundreds or thousands of small POPs across the world and continue to tout this as a strength, but <strong>the problem with smaller POPs is that the amount of content that can be stored is limited</strong></li>\n<li>This means that if a data request is sent to a small POP that’s full, the request will have to travel all the way to an origin server, which could increase the time by a factor of 10x or more</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Legacy CDNs (like Akamai) built their architectures based on the old Internet backbone aka dial-up which required these smaller POPs that are now nearly impossible to upgrade</li>\n<li>Fastly examined all this and took a different approach\n\n<ul>\n<li>If legacy POPs are local convenience stores in which you have to visit multiple to buy all your groceries, Fastly’s POPs are Costco-style supermarkets where you can buy everything at once</li>\n<li>Fastly’s POPs have much more storage space which significant reduces the need for requests to go back to origin servers</li>\n<li>In addition to that, Fastly utilized SSDs to store cached data which is more expensive but offer much faster retrieval times (in a <a href=\"https://www.fastly.com/blog/why-having-more-pops-isnt-always-better\">blog post</a>, Fastly compares this to “having all of your items waiting for you at the supermarket checkout stand instead of having to walk around the supermarket with a huge cart hunting for each item on your list”). The SSDs Fastly uses are orders of magnitudes faster than standard hard drives</li>\n<li>The punchline is just that Fastly created a super modern internet architecture through powerful POPs that result in much faster average content delivery times for their customers</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>3) Developer customization</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fastly’s founder Artur was frustrated by the lack of control from the CDNs he worked with and as a result, Fastly since its early days has been focused on serving developers and engineers</li>\n<li>While legacy providers required technical support to roll out changes, Fastly added programmability to content control through Varnish, an open-source web accelerator</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fastly.com/blog/benefits-using-varnish\">Varnish</a> allows for powerful features, such as instant purge of content, reverse proxies, and real-time data monitoring and management</li>\n<li>Perhaps most importantly, Varnish allows developers to adjust caching policies based on their unique needs, giving developers much more flexibility and control and resulting in happier customers</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>So to sum up, from the very start, Fastly took a <strong>different approach to its content delivery and customized nearly every step of the process</strong> which is ultimately what helped the company disrupt the legacy CDN industry</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Fastly’s Products</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I won’t cover too much of Fastly’s CDN products because I’ve basically mentioned what Fastly does there (deliver content to users real fast)\n\n<ul>\n<li>One thing to note, however, is that even with Fastly’s unique positioning, <strong>the overall sentiment is that CDN is a commoditized industry</strong> and so there will be significant competition on pricing moving forward</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>That’s why Fastly’s future areas of growth is not in CDN but in its <strong>Edge Compute Technology and Cloud Security</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Compute@Edge</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Starting with Edge Compute Technology, in November 2019, Fastly announced the launch of the beta testing for Compute@Edge</li>\n<li><strong>Compute@Edge is a platform that allows developers to build applications at the edge rather than in centralized data centers,</strong> and this provides the benefits of better security, performance, and scalability in a severless compute environment. This goes MUCH MORE beyond a traditional CDN.</li>\n<li>Traditionally, cloud-based applications <strong>centralize logic in a data center (imagine a really big office space full of servers)</strong> that eventually hops over to a user’s device regardless of where that user is geographically located\n\n<ul>\n<li>The problem with this is that computation costs money and it becomes more expensive the further out from the origin that you get</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Lucet\n\n<ul>\n<li>In response to the 4 aforementioned requirements, just like in its early days when it was developing its CDN, Fastly took on a customized approach by building Lucet</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>In the latest Q4 2020 earnings call, management highlighted that Compute@Edge has seen considerable progress, naming multiple use cases in the gaming, machine learning, language, and ad-tech industries</li>\n<li>With all this said, while Fastly is a pioneer in the edge compute space and Compute@Edge could be a source for a lot of growth, it’s also likely that other competitors will quickly copy the company&#39;s approach and there are no guarantees in the eventual size of the market</li>\n<li>As a result, this product is something <strong>investors need to keep a close eye on in 2021</strong> to see how the product develops and how competitors react</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Secure@Edge</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The second product to highlight is Fastly’s Cloud Security services, which is known as Secure@Edge</li>\n<li>While Fastly&#39;s previous security offerings were comparable to its competitors, Fastly notably bolstered its competitive position with its acquisition of <strong>Signal Sciences</strong> in August 2020</li>\n<li>To give a bit of background, Signal Sciences was founded by 3 former Etsy employees who were frustrated by the limits of existing security solutions to protect web apps\n\n<ul>\n<li>Just like Fastly, these founders designed a new Web Application Firewall or WAF that was both <strong>modern and developer friendly (similar to Fastly’s story)</strong></li>\n<li>From these beginning, the team built a WAF with 3 key advantages including <strong>higher accuracy, increased automation, and flexibility</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>And since then, Signal Sciences became one of the world’s hottest startups and was selected by Forbes in May 2020 as one of the top 25 fastest growing startups likely to reach a $1BN valuation\n\n<ul>\n<li>In February 2020, Gartner compiled reviews from customers of WAF products and Signal Sciences was the most highly rated amongst all competition with a 4.9 out of 5 rating</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Through the combined company, Fastly is offering what’s known as Secure@Edge and is arguably a leader in the web app security space</li>\n<li><strong>Secure@Edge will be built on top of the Compute@Edge platform,</strong> which means cloud applications won’t require a separate security layer in front of them which is a gamechanger and results in lower costs and higher effectiveness</li>\n<li>Perhaps most importantly, what this does is help accelerate <strong>edge computing adoption,</strong> which again is the big bet Fastly is making on its future growth</li>\n<li>The last thing I want to highlight are just a few of the metrics of the deal\n\n<ul>\n<li>Signal Sciences was acquired for $775 million of which $575 million was Fastly stock, which is good because that means the Signal Science’s team are Fastly shareholders and incentivized to help the company succeed</li>\n<li>Signal Sciences also about 42 additional enterprise customers to Fastly which the company can now more easily cross-sell other products to</li>\n<li>The company generated annual recurring revenue of $28 million as of June 2020 and was growing at 62% vs. Fastly which typically grows in the 30s and 40s</li>\n<li>Gross margins are above 85%, which is much higher than Fastly’s which is usually in the 50s</li>\n<li>And lastly, gross retention of 96% shows that the stickiness of Signal Science’s product which is a great sign</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>To recap, hopefully by now you see that Fastly is much more than a CDN company. Through Compute@Edge and Secure@Edge, Fastly is building the next generation’s edge computing platform</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Competitive Positioning</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fastly <a href=\"https://www.fastly.com/why-fastly\">markets itself well</a> as a company with a developer-first mentality, which is a very modern marketing approach versus in the past where legacy CDN companies used to target C-suite executives\n\n<ul>\n<li>The 3 key strengths Fastly touts are lower costs, more control, and better security - all 3 of which are things we covered</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The key competitor names in edge computing that you should know are Amazon’s Lambda@Edge, Microsoft’s Intelligent Edge, Akamai’s Intelligent Edge Platform, and Cloudflare’s Workers platform\n\n<ul>\n<li>I’m not going to go into Fastly’s competitors too much because I’ll be making another post later about Cloudflare which is Fastly’s main competition</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>When looking at all these competitors, Fastly boasts the fastest cold start time at 35 microseconds, which far beats out any of the legacy competitors and its biggest competitor Cloudflare</li>\n<li>The last important thing I want to mention in regards to Fastly’s competitive positioning is its management team\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fastly has assembled a world-class team both organically and through acquisitions and this is one of those intangible strengths that’s hard to measure but very important for a company that’s trying to disrupt an industry</li>\n<li>This <a href=\"https://softwarestackinvesting.com/fastly-and-signal-sciences/\">blog</a> has a really great description of the company’s management team (search the term “brain trust” and you can read a bunch of management bios there</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Customers</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fastly focuses on large enterprise customers, which the company defines as a customer that spends <strong>more than $100K annually</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is a primary distinguishing factor from Cloudflare, which is another leading CDN company that focuses on small businesses</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>According to their Q4 2020 earnings report, Fastly has a total number of customers of 2084, of which 324 are enterprise customers</li>\n<li>Fastly serves some of the most highly innovative digital companies in the world who which really validates the company’s services (Microsoft, Slack, Shopify, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Financial Overview</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highlights from Q4 2020 results:\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2019-2020 full-year revenue growth of 45%</strong> (a bit inflated due to Signal Sciences acquisition, but nevertheless, very solid)</li>\n<li><strong>Non-GAAP gross margin of 60.9%</strong> (up from 56.6% and this should trend upwards due to Signal Science’s high gross margin</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The key revenue-related metrics (besides growth rate) you need to keep track of each quarter (which are also provided in the quarterly earnings report) are the following: \n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DBNER</strong> - 143% this past quarter which is really high, and means that if a customer was spending $100 last year, they spend $143 today (but declined slightly from 147% from Q3 2020)</li>\n<li><strong>Net retention rate</strong> - 115% which is also high but declined from 122% from Q3 2020\n\n<ul>\n<li>DBNER excludes customer churn while the net retention rate does take into account customer churn (i.e. customers lost)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Annual revenue retention rate -</strong> 99%, meaning Fastly lost just 1% of customers (obviously very good)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>In its latest quarter, Fastly’s DBNER and NRRs showed to be on a slight decline due to the company’s own incredibly high standards, but still this is a bit worrisome to investors</li>\n<li>Valuation\n\n<ul>\n<li>At its share price around $73-$74, Fastly is currently trading at a ~23X 2022 sales multiple, which at a ~40% growth rate is very attractive given the current environment</li>\n<li>Company has been hit hard recently because of potential loss of TikTok as a customer (this is something still looming over the company’s head and in the latest call, management didn’t really confirm or deny anything) and relatively soft guidance of $375mm-$385mm for 2021, which represents a 30% growth rate ($291mm for 2020 revenue)\n\n<ul>\n<li>In my view, I think management is doing a good job being conservative and in the long-run, investors will be pleasantly surprised with Fastly’s growth as long as the company can execute on its Compute@Edge and Secure@Edge products</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Resources Used</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://softwarestackinvesting.com/tag/fsly/\">Software Stack Investing</a> <strong>-</strong> This blog is a godsend. SO much great information for a lot of top tech companies. Pretty dense to read through but this was a source for a lot of my DD post</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">Q4 2020 results</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Fastly-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript.pdf\">Earnings transcript</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Fastly is a leader in the CDN and edge computing space with 2 innovative products (Compute@Edge and Secure@Edge) that could be strong growth drivers for years to come (given strong execution). The company is boasting strong growth and has been a victim of its own success but is trading at relatively reasonably multiples for a leading software company. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
