They've all been facing price increases and shortages, but from conversations I've had with them recently, it's starting to hit a drastic turning point.\n\nLast year it was mainly lumber shortages and price increases across the board for raw materials. This year though, they've all seen prices stabilize and settle down a bit, but the shortages are increasing rapidly and across a wide range of industries in construction. Here's just a few things they've told me are backlogged:\n\n* Sand\n* Corner beading\n* Conduit\n* Vinyl Siding\n* Cinder blocks\n* Drywall\n\nMid-last year the backlog for a lot of these items was around 1-2 months, and they were usually able to secure some needed supplied from HD or Lowes. Right now though, it's more like 6-8 months and almost every big box store is sold out or drastically limited.\n\nIn their own words: \"Something will have to change soon, a collapse or a dip in the industry, otherwise these new developments that are cropping up will come to a grinding halt by the middle of the year, because we just can't get supplies out.\" Alarmist? Maybe, but I'd like to see if I can play this position at all.\n\nI imagine taking some long puts in a few residential construction companies or materials stocks? $MTH, $TPH, $LEN, $KBH, $EXP were my first thoughts. I'd love to hear any ideas or opinions!",
