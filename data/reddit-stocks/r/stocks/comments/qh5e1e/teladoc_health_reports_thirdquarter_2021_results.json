(NYSE: TDOC), the global leader in whole-person virtual care, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.  \n\n“Our strong performance in the third quarter reflects our continued success in leading the transformation of healthcare delivery and expanding access for all,” said Jason Gorevic, chief executive officer at Teladoc Health. “By leveraging our unique combination of data, analytics, technology and dedicated healthcare professionals, we are driving growth across our business. The third quarter was notable in expanding relationships with a number of leading national health plans with the successful launch of our Primary360 offering which reimagines the primary care model and delivers increased access and engagement to members.”\n\n“As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 and into 2022, we are confident in our ability to innovate, anticipate and solve for the evolving whole-person health needs of consumers and healthcare professionals globally,\" Gorevic added.\n\n Platform-Enabled Sessions are a unique instance in which our licensed software platform has facilitated a virtual voice or video encounter between a care provider and our client’s patient, or between care providers. We believe platform-enabled sessions are an indicator of the value our clients derive from the platform they license from us in order to facilitate virtual care.\n\n* **Net loss** was $(84.3) million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $(35.9) million for the third quarter of 2020.
