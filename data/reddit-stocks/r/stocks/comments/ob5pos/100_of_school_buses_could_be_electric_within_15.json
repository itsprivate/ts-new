I mean, we’ve delivered buses in New York, in Minnesota, all across the country.”\nThe infrastructure bill, which is supported by President Biden, is expected to provide an additional $15 billion to electric vehicles infrastructure. Under the framework of the bill,  $7.5 billion is to be allocated to schools and public transit organizations to help convert to electric buses.\nGervais noted that a transition to electric school buses would have a plethora of benefits besides a reduction in carbon emissions. “There’s no noise pollution, so it’s more quiet and the kids are more calm and more concentrated when they go to school,” he said. “These are the kids and the people of tomorrow [who] will drive electric cars in the future.”\nCurrently, less than 1% of school buses are electric. Over 400,000 school buses drive over 3.5 billion miles each year, according to a Bellwether Education Partners study. The transition to electric buses will take initiative, but with the right moves, Gervais said, the entirety of the US school bus fleet could be electrified in 10-15 years.\nAbroad, electric vehicles have sparked the interest of consumers of late — 11% of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year were either fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Meanwhile, EVs and plug-ins accounted for less than 3% of new car sales in the United States.\nMediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images via Getty Images\nIhsaan Fanusie is a writer at Yahoo Finance.
