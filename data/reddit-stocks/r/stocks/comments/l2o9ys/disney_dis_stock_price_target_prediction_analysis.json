What is my price prediction for Disney?</strong> <strong>Read until the end of the post</strong> <strong>as I reveal my price target for Disney and what I expect to happen next</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>~Very Very Long Post~</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hello everyone and stock analysis in which we will go into an in-depth analysis about Disney’s stock! We are going to talk about Disney as a company and what’s the upside for the stock! So, let’s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions, cash flows analysis and my price target for the stock in the next years &amp; months.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s start by talking a little about <a href=\"https://ibb.co/PMhMz9f\">Disney</a>, yeah, I know everyone knows Disney, their movies, their parks and much more, but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price, especially due to their Disney+ and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Disney is the biggest entertainment company in the world, and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney, ESPN and many more others, while they also have a vast segment of parks &amp; experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts, cruise lines and many others. Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct-to-Consumer networks &amp; streaming services like Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and others. The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded.</p>\n\n<p>So, we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020. The company has cut the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/YQQ8xLL\">dividend</a> payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company, with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business, which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3-4 years, and which has now surpassed all their expectations, and made the stock pop to all time highs of over $180 just recently.</p>\n\n<p>Disney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business.</p>\n\n<p>They announced at least 10 Marvel <a href=\"https://ibb.co/RQrxPfR\">series</a> like Captain Marvel 2, a new Doctor Strange development while continuing <a href=\"https://ibb.co/87CcQ7B\">movies</a> for Thor, Black Panther and <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Dpr73G2\">others</a>. They also announced at least 10 Star Wars <a href=\"https://ibb.co/9HBrXZj\">series</a> <a href=\"https://ibb.co/PZkKTC4\">including</a> the continuation of their big hit The Mandalorian and also provided updates on more child friendly productions with 15 Disney &amp; Pixar <a href=\"https://ibb.co/HNkMYvT\">series</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The company has far outpaced any of their previous <a href=\"https://ibb.co/vhWGCRd\">GUIDANCE</a>, as their initial guidance in all 3 big streaming services, Disney+, Hulu &amp; ESPN have been reached in less than a year, with Disney+ and ESPN+ hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their bottom expectations, as Disney+ was a hit since its start, with over 10M signups in the first <a href=\"https://ibb.co/PW4WRfY\">DAY</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Disney+ also keeps expanding into multiple countries, as they continued to launch the streaming business in over 15 <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Kwk9dd1\">countries</a> just recently in November, as their streaming services are <a href=\"https://ibb.co/4N8s3yt\">offered</a> on most devices like Android &amp; Apple devices, Amazon’s Fire TV, Roku streaming platform and Google’s devices.</p>\n\n<p>The company has extreme pricing power due to their capability to generate revenues from their other income streams but haven’t chosen to abuse that with only minor increases in price while also offering a great Disney <a href=\"https://ibb.co/R2p28zM\">Bundle</a> for just $13/month that includes the top 3 streaming services, Disney+, Hulu &amp; ESPN+.</p>\n\n<p>Hulu has seen a huge subscriber <a href=\"https://ibb.co/XkVCK72\">growth</a> in the past years, adding around 8M subscribers/year since 2017 as they offer multiple subscription <a href=\"https://ibb.co/sFnV4gV\">choices</a>, starting from 6$ up to 71$ for their no ads &amp; live TV service. After these results, Disney has slightly increased their bottom-line expectations for the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/4sK1HR7\">service</a> to 50M by 2024 and are expecting Hulu to become <a href=\"https://ibb.co/W3C6Ybm\">profitable</a> as soon as FY 2023.</p>\n\n<p>They also revised the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/S0wx121\">ESPN+</a> expectations from between 8-12M to an incredible 20-30M subscribers range by 2024 as they also expect this service to become <a href=\"https://ibb.co/4S8Qj8b\">profitable</a> by FY 2023.</p>\n\n<p>But guys, by far, the biggest <a href=\"https://ibb.co/3swTzSG\">guidance</a> upgrade for Disney has come from Disney+, with a revised guidance of over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024, which is 30% more than Netflix has right now, after over 20 years since it was founded. They are also planning on <a href=\"https://ibb.co/zZszZWR\">pricing</a> Disney+ at $8/month starting this March, as they have revised the content <a href=\"https://ibb.co/kKK2Rxq\">expense</a> to over $8B for 2024, more than double their previous estimates, as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the huge number of subscribers, <a href=\"https://ibb.co/1Lrscqx\">Disney+</a> is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground, but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney+ to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024, which is pretty much on schedule.</p>\n\n<p>So, let’s go a little through the latest quarterly &amp; yearly results for <a href=\"https://ibb.co/x3n4Bmb\">Disney</a>. The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020, as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of $2.02 for the year. Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected, as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney+ service.</p>\n\n<p>The company <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Bjpz16L\">reported</a> just over $7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over $28B for the year, both of them being increases of at least 11% vs the previous year. Disney also reported a 41% increase in Direct-to-Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost $17B in revenues for the year, while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment &amp; the Park, Experiences &amp; Products segment saw a major loss of revenues, with both of them being down more than 50% for the 4th quarter vs 2019.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/G0KBJQG\">Disney</a> also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business, totaling an operating income of just over $8B for the year, a 45% decrease over 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Their latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney+ had a big effect in the operating <a href=\"https://ibb.co/t3wfwzC\">results</a>, as the costs of rolling out Disney+ eat up the revenues, while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema, which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top &amp; bottom line. Also, to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter-segment transaction between their Media &amp; Studio segments to their Direct-to-Consumer segment.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/SxXHZLK\">Disney</a> also saw their Parks &amp; Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts, which is estimated to have had a negative impact of $2.4B for their operating income.</p>\n\n<p>Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50% in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity.</p>\n\n<p>We also saw Direct-to-Consumer operating loss and revenues <a href=\"https://ibb.co/G7Sg19n\">improve</a> for the 4th quarter, as ESPN+ &amp; Hulu were a boost while Disney+ continued to burn money at a very high rate, that is needed for a rapid growth of the service.</p>\n\n<p>We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year/year, with ESPN &amp; HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting. Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue/subscriber was seen in <a href=\"https://ibb.co/LzmrvwV\">Hulu&#39;s</a> top package while the rest of them dropped, very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also to be noted that though most of their parks &amp; resorts were affected, Disney didn’t stop investing in them and had a <a href=\"https://ibb.co/2jsth35\">Capex</a> of over $4B in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ibb.co/dk88L7f\">company</a> also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings, but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses.</p>\n\n<p>So, you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!</p>\n\n<p>I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest <a href=\"https://ibb.co/9WxkCyd\">plans</a> announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…</p>\n\n<p>So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow <a href=\"https://ibb.co/mtb7s5y\">projections</a>, though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.</p>\n\n<p>I implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business, as the EBITDA margins <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Svr8NjN\">stood</a> at over 30% before that, and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again.</p>\n\n<p>I also used the Depreciation &amp; Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10% growth, while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital. I used a 15% capex increases like I will do in my growth projections, and used a 9% discount rate, which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years.</p>\n\n<p>Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re-rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results.</p>\n\n<p>So, this means we have an estimated $56B worth of FCF for a 9% discount rate. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3.5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost $500B by 2025. So, let’s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1.81B, that would mean a stock price of $175 and would imply a return of just over 2%. But I don’t expect this to be the best way to value the company. I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company. So, I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA, which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020, though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples, maybe even 20 to 25. So, with this 16 times multiple, the stock would be undervalued by over 40% right now, but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches. So, I expect <a href=\"https://ibb.co/hM8mqnd\">Disney</a> to trade around 210$ using the DCF model, which would imply a 22% return, which seems pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation <a href=\"https://ibb.co/jkL0JG9\">approach</a> for the future.</p>\n\n<p>I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Disney earnings/share will be by 2025.</p>\n\n<p>For my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c/edit#gid=1003936878\">projections</a> I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. So, for the Media Networks I implied a 10% increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business. I did however imply a return to normal in Parks &amp; Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that, while for the Direct-to-Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast, Disney+ should account for around $20B in revenues by 2025 on its own.</p>\n\n<p>For Disney’s cost of sales, I maintained the 68% expense ratio on their Media Networks, while for their Parks &amp; Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period. Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct-to-Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021, a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75% in 2025. For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10% decrease in each year, but this shouldn’t affect the results that much in the end.</p>\n\n<p>I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15% annual growth, as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years, while for the interest income &amp; expenses I implied a 10% annual decrease, but this numbers are again so small that they don’t impact the end result that much, and didn’t want to assume and other significant losses or income.</p>\n\n<p>I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21% and implied a .5% dilution of the stock each year.</p>\n\n<p>So, let take a <a href=\"https://ibb.co/nj7sX5h\">recap</a>, I expect Disney to have over $137B in revenues in 2025 and almost $35B in gross revenues. After subtracting their $8B capex and the almost $700M related to interest, and also account for the tax rate, Disney should have just over $20B in income after tax or just over $11 in earnings/share. So, adjusted for the .5% dilution, this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now.</p>\n\n<p>I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically, but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth, especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now, I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal. So, depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35, the stock can trade between $220 and almost $390.</p>\n\n<p>So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? <a href=\"https://ibb.co/849LJH3\">Here</a> are my actual price targets… I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is $249 which would imply a return of over 45%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 77% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $359, which would imply a return of 110%. So yeah guys, this are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 20 &amp; 25 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30-35.</p>\n\n<p>So here is the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c\">FULL</a> spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past. The company has <a href=\"https://ibb.co/BP8SVHK\">increased</a> in value by more 18% despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57% in the 4 years <a href=\"https://ibb.co/bHxHf5h\">before</a> 2020. So yes, I think Disney will be one of the best re-opening plays and stay-at-home trades as well, so a win-win no matter what.</p>\n\n<p>The company also has very good <a href=\"https://ibb.co/JntSMr8\">financials</a>, with more than $35B in current assets vs only $26B in current liabilities and with over $200B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future, even after the bad year they had in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/1sRqCTB\">analysts</a> expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025, of around $115B compared to $137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting. But I think this haven’t been revised enough and don’t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Disney?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at this <a href=\"https://ibb.co/cTCvdgf\">CHART</a>, Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap-up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times. But more recently they didn’t fill the gap-up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers’ numbers revealed at the investors day. The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months, but right now the RSI has dropped to 51, which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again. So, my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158$ before the next quarterly <a href=\"https://ibb.co/k8x6cCW\">earnings</a> are released in February. Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business, and that might be enough to push the stock even higher. So, using the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/ZfcJZz9\">DCF</a> valuation, I think we can see Disney trading at around $210 by the end of the year, especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks &amp; other revenues streams come back at increased strength.</p>\n\n<p>And let’s take a quick look at what 27 <a href=\"https://ibb.co/VJNg2m5\">analysts</a> on Wall Street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $181 and a high price target of $220, as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney. So yet again, I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney, as it’s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>So, what would I do? Well, I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to $160.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 65% of the float being held by big <a href=\"https://ibb.co/5KRGT0Y\">funds</a> like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock.</p>\n\n<p>So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Bob <a href=\"https://ibb.co/1JJzyq2\">Chapek</a> has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020, and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business, so, if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c\">HERE</a>!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!
