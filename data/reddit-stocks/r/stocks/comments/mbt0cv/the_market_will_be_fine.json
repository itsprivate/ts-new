This explains why the Yields actually went down a lot while the rest of the market as a whole was tanking.</p>\n\n<p>But if you noticed, one thing did well: FAANG. Why? because analysts expect the yields going down to help the large cap growth stocks.</p>\n\n<p>But i think once the large funds are done rebalancing, people will buy back into the market for sure with the low yields, and we should see growth doing better.</p>\n\n<p>I think the most important thing is to not panic and hold to our red positions... If the feds was able to save us from a massive covid crash, they can save us from a tiny dip that was caused by literally nothing lol</p>\n\n<p>Note: I expect April could still be volatile, but i really think the summer will good to us, and Q4 even better =)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
