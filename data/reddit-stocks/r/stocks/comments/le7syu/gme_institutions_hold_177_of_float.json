My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png\">I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp\">How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?</a> Here&#39;s an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let&#39;s assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  </p>\n\n<p>In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company&#39;s stock overall.  </p>\n\n<p>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg\">~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\">This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.</a>  </p>\n\n<p>So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   </p>\n\n<p>Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png\">But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.</a> Max pain theory states it is in the market maker&#39;s best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  </p>\n\n<p>With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png\">Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.</a> And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME can is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.
