The U.S. and its allies have accused Russia of planning to use false reports of attacks on separatists as a pretext for an invasion. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Russia has filed a report with the United Nations alleging that Ukraine’s military has committed “crimes” against residents of the eastern Donbas region. \n\n“This is likely to be the bigger concern for NATO and the U.S., if separatist forces try and goad Ukrainian forces into a counter-response, thus creating an excuse for a Russian incursion, and for all hell to break loose,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note.\n\n“The bigger risk for markets is that President Putin simply leaves the bulk of his forces on the border and simply plays a game of cat and mouse for the next few weeks and months,” Hewson said.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-stock-futures-under-pressure-as-russia-ukraine-tensions-simmer-11645097589?mod=newsviewer\\_click](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-stock-futures-under-pressure-as-russia-ukraine-tensions-simmer-11645097589?mod=newsviewer_click)",
