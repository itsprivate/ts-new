I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 26th, 2021.\n\n# **Earnings and the Federal Reserve are next big catalysts as stocks enter week ahead on an upswing - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/earnings-federal-reserve-are-next-big-catalysts-as-stocks-enter-week-ahead-on-an-upswing.html)**\n*****\n> Here comes one of the biggest market weeks of the summer.\n*****\n> First, the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday. While no action is expected, there could be some mention of the central bank’s possible wind down of its bond program. That could move the markets since the tapering of the central bank’s bond purchases is seen as the first step on the way to interest rate hikes.\n*****\n> Then there are about 165 S&P 500 companies releasing earnings reports, including the biggest tech names— Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook. Tesla is reporting, as are industrial heavy weights Boeing and Caterpillar. There are slew of consumer names, including Procter & Gamble and McDonald’s.\n*****\n> There is also important economic news. The second quarter is expected to be the peak period for post-pandemic growth, and gross domestic product for the quarter will be released Thursday. On Friday, the Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditure inflation index, is released.\n*****\n> # Fresh highs for major indexes\n> The three major U.S. stock indexes enter the busy week with fresh closing records. The Dow closed above 35,000 for the first time on Friday. The S&P 500 gained 1% to close at 4,411.79, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day up 1%.\n*****\n> “I think earnings are going to be the show, and if the pattern we’ve seen thus far continues next week, and it’s likely it will, that’s going to find a market that has a path of least resistance to the upside and I think that’s good news,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n> According to Refinitiv, earnings for the second quarter are looking to be up 78.1%.\n*****\n> “It’s going to be crazy,” said Hogan. “I think the order of magnitude of earnings beats is still underappreciated, and I think that will continue next week: 87% of companies are beating estimates.”\n*****\n> Hogan said early in earnings season, stocks of companies that beat expectations did not react, but now they are and that should continue. The fact a handful of the biggest market cap stocks — like Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet — are reporting so close to each other could have an impact.\n*****\n> “This is like the World Series of earnings smack in the middle of summer,” he said.\n*****\n> # Stocks rebound\n> Investors will also be watching the behavior of markets themselves. Stocks ended the week with solid gains, but the bruising sell-off Monday has left its mark. Some strategists say it could have been a warning sign for more turbulence later in the quarter.\n*****\n> Stocks took their cue from the 10-year Treasury yield, which was falling Monday on fears the delta variant of Covid could slow global growth. The yield hit a low of 1.12% early Tuesday before reversing. As the benchmark yield rose, stocks rallied.\n*****\n> For now, stocks seem to be set for more gains. The Dow closed the past week at 35,061.55, up about 1%. The S&P 500 gained 1.9% for the week, ending at 4,411.79. The Nasdaq climbed 2.8% week-to-date, and the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 2.1%.\n*****\n> Communications services, which includes internet names, was the best performing sector in the past week with a 3.2% gain. Tech was also strong, up 2.8%. Consumer discretionary was also a top sector, up 2.9%. Cyclical industrials and material lagged with fractional gains, and energy was slightly lower.\n*****\n> Scott Redler, chief strategic officer with T3Live.com, said the Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft are already doing well ahead of earnings, so it will be important to see how they trade.\n*****\n> “Some things are priced for perfection and some aren’t,” he said. “Microsoft is already at an all-time high. It’s priced for perfection. It will be interesting to see if Apple can hold and stay above $150.” Apple closed at $148.56 per share Friday.\n*****\n> # Fed ‘taper talk’\n> Ben Jeffery, U.S. rates strategist at BMO, said Treasury yields could find a catalyst in the Fed. He expects the 10-year to begin moving down again, and says it could possibly touch a low of 1.10%. The 10-year was at 1.28% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n> Strategists do not expect to see much new in the Federal Reserve’s statement. They await comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for guidance on the central bank’s move toward tapering back its quantitative easing program.\n*****\n> The Fed is expected to announce that it is officially talking about winding down the program well before it actually starts. Many Fed watchers believe that guidance will come in late August, at the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium, or later in the fall.\n*****\n> “I think it will be interesting to see how dovish Powell tries to be with the delta variant risk and concerns about that,” said Jeffery.\n*****\n> Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, does not expect much new from Powell this week. “I’m really targeting Jackson Hole as the most likely candidate for a pivot point for policy and communication,” he said. “However, next week’s meeting could set the stage for that with some statements that point us toward some improvement in the economy. They’ll be highlighting the new risks of the delta variant, and that’s the risk we think they point out.”\n*****\n> Slowing the bond program is important since it is a signal that the Fed is on the road to reversing its easy policies, including ultimately its zero policy rate. Tilley said the central bank will probably take a year to wind down its $120 billion a month in bond purchases, and then the door is open to rate hikes.\n*****\n> Investors will also be watching second quarter GDP to see how much strength there is in the economy.\n*****\n> According to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics rapid update, a survey of economists expects second quarter growth to grow by an average 9.7%. It is expected to be the peak period for growth, and the average forecast for third quarter growth is 8.3%.\n*****\n> Tilley said he expects growth for the 2021 year of 7% to 7.5%.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CDWkmCZ.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/bZu7Atx.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/De6Fve7.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wsfECP4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eTBVPa5.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5plhqOq.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VsQ2PTn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/13zKQDHw/marketpulllbacklevels2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/g2BHkrS5/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jIjCnTz.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EeBotv1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/046uiXj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7X5n817.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # August has been a dangerous month for the market\n\n> August is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 33 years, 1988-2020 with average declines ranging from 0.4% by Russell 2000 to 0.8% by DJIA. For NASDAQ August ranks second worst over the same period with an average gain of 0.2%.\n\n> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.\n\n> In post-election years, Augusts’ rankings are little changed. August is the worst month for DJIA and Russell 1000 and second worst for S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average declines in post-election year Augusts swell to 0.8% by Russell 2000 to 1.7% by DJIA. Each index has also seen more declining post-election year Augusts than positive.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/78fd9b0e8110b9d2e779ce650c18cd79/3293cb0a1c43f61d-02/s400x600/92f8c448cdafe2c1f033ccdad8bd7b3461f26a66.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Bulls and Bears Dead Even\n\n> For the third week in a row, bullish sentiment has slid with this week's reading from the AAII falling to 30.6%. With a cumulative 18-percentage point decline in that time, bullish sentiment is now at the lowest level since October 1st, 2020.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n> An identical share of respondents to the survey reported as bearish this week. That is only the 47th time in the survey's history that an equal share reported as bullish and bearish with the most recent other occurrence being the end of October 2020. Now back above 30%, bearish sentiment is at the highest level since the first week of February which is also essentially right in line with the historical average for bearish sentiment (30.53%).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n> Identical readings in bullish and bearish sentiment means the spread between the two is at zero. As shown below, that is the first non-positive reading in the spread since the last week of January.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**\n\n> As previously mentioned, throughout the history of the AAII's survey going back to the late 1980s, there have only been 47 instances of identical readings in bullish and bearish sentiment, or when the bull-bear spread equals zero, including the most recent instance. In the chart below we show the average performance of the S&P 500 over the next weeks and months following those instances. As shown, across the board the S&P 500 has tended to underperform the norm with the one-week and one-month periods averaging a decline. Again, while the gains are smaller than normal, the S&P 500 has at least been higher 71.7% of the time six months out and 84.4% of the time one year later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Perf.png))**\n\n> Not all of the losses to bullish sentiment turned bearish. Neutral sentiment rose 1.7 percentage points for a second week in a row. At 38.7%, neutral sentiment is at the highest level since June 10th.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Is It Time For A 5% Pullback?\n\n> Monday’s big down day was a harsh reminder of how markets actually can produce volatility. It was the worst day of the year for the Dow and only the second drop of 1% or more for the S&P 500 Index in just over two months.\n\n> As we noted recently in Three Things That Worry Us, there are many reasons to think that after more than a 90% rally (and virtually a double on a total return basis), the S&P 500 could finally be ready for a break. From less stocks participating, to weak seasonality, to a lack of bears, to typical choppiness during year two of a bull market, the summer months could be ripe for an eventual pullback (down 5-9%) or even a 10% correction.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “The truth is investors have been very spoiled by the recent stock market performance,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, we haven’t seen as much as a 5% pullback since October. Although we firmly think this bull market is alive and well, let’s not fool ourselves into thinking trees grow forever. Risk is no doubt increasing as we head into the troublesome August and September months.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the average year sees three separate 5% or more pullbacks for the S&P 500 with not a single one happening yet in 2021. This doesn’t mean a 5% correction is directly around the corner, but note that most stocks are actually already down as much as 10% off their recent highs, suggesting the internals of the market are a tad weak and risk is higher than normal.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Looking at 10% corrections, the S&P 500 has averaged exactly one a year since 1950. Of course, with the historic volatility last year we saw four separate 10% corrections, though there hasn’t been a 10% correction since March 2020. Again, this could be getting long in the tooth after the 90% plus rally from the lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Overall, worries over inflation, yields, the Delta COVID-19 variant, peaking economic data, or something else will get the headlines for any market weakness. We know that year two of bull markets can be choppy and frustrating, but the truth is earnings remain extremely strong, justifying stocks at current levels. It is just that sometimes stocks need to catch their breath, and we wouldn’t be surprised at all if that happened over the coming months.\n\n*****\n\n> # The Recession Is Over, So What Happens Next?\n\n> The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) announced yesterday that the COVID-19 recession is over. If things don’t feel all that different, it’s because they announced the recession ended in April 2020. Yes, that’s last year. We are now in the 15th month of the new expansion. This delay is perfectly normal. NBER doesn’t change a recession call once it’s made, so they need to have a high degree of confidence in the supporting data. Waiting until 15 months after the recession is over is actually the average since they started making recession calls in real time in the 1970s.\n\n> “Stock markets gave us an early signal on the end of the recession back in March 2020,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The S&P 500 tends to bottom before a recession ends and it did this time as well, despite the narrow window of the shortest recession ever. It just took a while for the economic data to catch up.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recession lasted only two months, the shortest on record, but also one of the steepest, the economy contracting more in just two months than any other recession back to 1948.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.20.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So what happens now?\n\n> Based on history, we are likely in for several more years of economic expansion. Expansions are on no particular timetable but the average length of an expansion does tell us something about how long it usually takes for the kind of economic excesses to build up that usually cause recessions. While post-World War II expansions have lasted as little as 12 months, the average is more than five years and the last four expansions have averaged over eight years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.20.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Absent an unexpected shock, we would not be on the lookout for a recession until the Federal Reserve (Fed) raises its policy rate several times. Recessions are usually accompanied by an inverted yield curve, where short-term interests are higher than long-term rates, not the normal situation. Since the Fed has a lot of influence over short-term interest rates, they often play some role in the yield curve inverting. The Fed usually won’t start to raise rates until the economy starts to strengthen and will continue to raise rates as it heats up. Raising rates several times is a signal that excesses have started to build that make the economy more vulnerable to a recession. Raising rates also adds to that vulnerability by pushing up short-term borrowing costs.\n\n> While rate hike expectations have come forward, they still put a recession several years away. In the Fed policy committee’s latest economic projections, the consensus view was for no rate hikes in 2021 or 2022, and two rate hikes in 2023. While those projections will change based on what’s actually happening in the economy, if it held true it likely would not be enough to signal increased danger of a recession.\n\n> But just because we don’t see a recession on the horizon does not mean it’s an all clear for markets. As discussed in our Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed, we do still view the overall economic backdrop as supportive. But we are also in the second year of a bull market, which tends to be choppier than the first year, although the S&P 500 Index does typically still see gains.\n\n> NBER’s announcement is something to celebrate, but it does not signal smooth sailing ahead. Still, most bear markets are associated with recessions, and with plenty of fiscal stimulus still in play, the Fed’s policy rate still near zero, and the labor market continuing to see strong improvement, even if slower than expected, absent a shock we are not expecting a recession any time soon, and that’s usually good news for markets.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Gzq3pvf.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/GQYUlEj.jpg))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 7.26.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sbS76D8.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 7.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9q9HLlJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  7.27.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E8wFQJU.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1r88sk1.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 7.27.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ktoxTfa.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XCMM6ZG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 7.28.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sPyHR1A.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TMJTJ1r.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 7.28.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jxSSMLJ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/dWCdoQe.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/BuMwKLA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 7.29.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ShT2rvf.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xhsbNIp.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/kx8Jqv9.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 7.29.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/T71GBib.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hjJ9NWo.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EDEIxtJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 7.30.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/27MBCiJ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1UiKK56.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 7.30.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",

The S&amp;P 500 gained 1% to close at 4,411.79, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day up 1%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“I think earnings are going to be the show, and if the pattern we’ve seen thus far continues next week, and it’s likely it will, that’s going to find a market that has a path of least resistance to the upside and I think that’s good news,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>According to Refinitiv, earnings for the second quarter are looking to be up 78.1%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“It’s going to be crazy,” said Hogan. “I think the order of magnitude of earnings beats is still underappreciated, and I think that will continue next week: 87% of companies are beating estimates.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Hogan said early in earnings season, stocks of companies that beat expectations did not react, but now they are and that should continue. The fact a handful of the biggest market cap stocks — like Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet — are reporting so close to each other could have an impact.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“This is like the World Series of earnings smack in the middle of summer,” he said.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Stocks rebound</h1>\n\n<p>Investors will also be watching the behavior of markets themselves. Stocks ended the week with solid gains, but the bruising sell-off Monday has left its mark. Some strategists say it could have been a warning sign for more turbulence later in the quarter.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Stocks took their cue from the 10-year Treasury yield, which was falling Monday on fears the delta variant of Covid could slow global growth. The yield hit a low of 1.12% early Tuesday before reversing. As the benchmark yield rose, stocks rallied.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>For now, stocks seem to be set for more gains. The Dow closed the past week at 35,061.55, up about 1%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.9% for the week, ending at 4,411.79. The Nasdaq climbed 2.8% week-to-date, and the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 2.1%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Communications services, which includes internet names, was the best performing sector in the past week with a 3.2% gain. Tech was also strong, up 2.8%. Consumer discretionary was also a top sector, up 2.9%. Cyclical industrials and material lagged with fractional gains, and energy was slightly lower.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Scott Redler, chief strategic officer with T3Live.com, said the Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft are already doing well ahead of earnings, so it will be important to see how they trade.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“Some things are priced for perfection and some aren’t,” he said. “Microsoft is already at an all-time high. It’s priced for perfection. It will be interesting to see if Apple can hold and stay above $150.” Apple closed at $148.56 per share Friday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Fed ‘taper talk’</h1>\n\n<p>Ben Jeffery, U.S. rates strategist at BMO, said Treasury yields could find a catalyst in the Fed. He expects the 10-year to begin moving down again, and says it could possibly touch a low of 1.10%. The 10-year was at 1.28% Friday afternoon.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Strategists do not expect to see much new in the Federal Reserve’s statement. They await comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for guidance on the central bank’s move toward tapering back its quantitative easing program.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The Fed is expected to announce that it is officially talking about winding down the program well before it actually starts. Many Fed watchers believe that guidance will come in late August, at the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium, or later in the fall.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“I think it will be interesting to see how dovish Powell tries to be with the delta variant risk and concerns about that,” said Jeffery.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, does not expect much new from Powell this week. “I’m really targeting Jackson Hole as the most likely candidate for a pivot point for policy and communication,” he said. “However, next week’s meeting could set the stage for that with some statements that point us toward some improvement in the economy. They’ll be highlighting the new risks of the delta variant, and that’s the risk we think they point out.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Slowing the bond program is important since it is a signal that the Fed is on the road to reversing its easy policies, including ultimately its zero policy rate. Tilley said the central bank will probably take a year to wind down its $120 billion a month in bond purchases, and then the door is open to rate hikes.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Investors will also be watching second quarter GDP to see how much strength there is in the economy.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>According to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics rapid update, a survey of economists expects second quarter growth to grow by an average 9.7%. It is expected to be the peak period for growth, and the average forecast for third quarter growth is 8.3%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Tilley said he expects growth for the 2021 year of 7% to 7.5%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><strong>This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/CDWkmCZ.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/bZu7Atx.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/De6Fve7.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Futures Markets as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wsfECP4.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eTBVPa5.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5plhqOq.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/VsQ2PTn.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.postimg.cc/13zKQDHw/marketpulllbacklevels2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.postimg.cc/g2BHkrS5/marketrallylevels1.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())</strong></h6>\n\n<p>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Here are the upcoming IPO&#39;s for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/jIjCnTz.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Friday&#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/EeBotv1.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/046uiXj.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7X5n817.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>August has been a dangerous month for the market</h1>\n\n<p>August is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 33 years, 1988-2020 with average declines ranging from 0.4% by Russell 2000 to 0.8% by DJIA. For NASDAQ August ranks second worst over the same period with an average gain of 0.2%.</p>\n\n<p>Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.</p>\n\n<p>In post-election years, Augusts’ rankings are little changed. August is the worst month for DJIA and Russell 1000 and second worst for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average declines in post-election year Augusts swell to 0.8% by Russell 2000 to 1.7% by DJIA. Each index has also seen more declining post-election year Augusts than positive.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/78fd9b0e8110b9d2e779ce650c18cd79/3293cb0a1c43f61d-02/s400x600/92f8c448cdafe2c1f033ccdad8bd7b3461f26a66.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Bulls and Bears Dead Even</h1>\n\n<p>For the third week in a row, bullish sentiment has slid with this week&#39;s reading from the AAII falling to 30.6%. With a cumulative 18-percentage point decline in that time, bullish sentiment is now at the lowest level since October 1st, 2020.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Bull.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>An identical share of respondents to the survey reported as bearish this week. That is only the 47th time in the survey&#39;s history that an equal share reported as bullish and bearish with the most recent other occurrence being the end of October 2020. Now back above 30%, bearish sentiment is at the highest level since the first week of February which is also essentially right in line with the historical average for bearish sentiment (30.53%).</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Bear.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Identical readings in bullish and bearish sentiment means the spread between the two is at zero. As shown below, that is the first non-positive reading in the spread since the last week of January.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-BB-Spread.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>As previously mentioned, throughout the history of the AAII&#39;s survey going back to the late 1980s, there have only been 47 instances of identical readings in bullish and bearish sentiment, or when the bull-bear spread equals zero, including the most recent instance. In the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 over the next weeks and months following those instances. As shown, across the board the S&amp;P 500 has tended to underperform the norm with the one-week and one-month periods averaging a decline. Again, while the gains are smaller than normal, the S&amp;P 500 has at least been higher 71.7% of the time six months out and 84.4% of the time one year later.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Perf.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Not all of the losses to bullish sentiment turned bearish.

It was the worst day of the year for the Dow and only the second drop of 1% or more for the S&amp;P 500 Index in just over two months.</p>\n\n<p>As we noted recently in Three Things That Worry Us, there are many reasons to think that after more than a 90% rally (and virtually a double on a total return basis), the S&amp;P 500 could finally be ready for a break. From less stocks participating, to weak seasonality, to a lack of bears, to typical choppiness during year two of a bull market, the summer months could be ripe for an eventual pullback (down 5-9%) or even a 10% correction.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>“The truth is investors have been very spoiled by the recent stock market performance,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, we haven’t seen as much as a 5% pullback since October. Although we firmly think this bull market is alive and well, let’s not fool ourselves into thinking trees grow forever. Risk is no doubt increasing as we head into the troublesome August and September months.”</p>\n\n<p>As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the average year sees three separate 5% or more pullbacks for the S&amp;P 500 with not a single one happening yet in 2021. This doesn’t mean a 5% correction is directly around the corner, but note that most stocks are actually already down as much as 10% off their recent highs, suggesting the internals of the market are a tad weak and risk is higher than normal.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Looking at 10% corrections, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged exactly one a year since 1950. Of course, with the historic volatility last year we saw four separate 10% corrections, though there hasn’t been a 10% correction since March 2020. Again, this could be getting long in the tooth after the 90% plus rally from the lows.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Overall, worries over inflation, yields, the Delta COVID-19 variant, peaking economic data, or something else will get the headlines for any market weakness. We know that year two of bull markets can be choppy and frustrating, but the truth is earnings remain extremely strong, justifying stocks at current levels. It is just that sometimes stocks need to catch their breath, and we wouldn’t be surprised at all if that happened over the coming months.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>The Recession Is Over, So What Happens Next?</h1>\n\n<p>The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) announced yesterday that the COVID-19 recession is over. If things don’t feel all that different, it’s because they announced the recession ended in April 2020. Yes, that’s last year. We are now in the 15th month of the new expansion. This delay is perfectly normal. NBER doesn’t change a recession call once it’s made, so they need to have a high degree of confidence in the supporting data. Waiting until 15 months after the recession is over is actually the average since they started making recession calls in real time in the 1970s.</p>\n\n<p>“Stock markets gave us an early signal on the end of the recession back in March 2020,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The S&amp;P 500 tends to bottom before a recession ends and it did this time as well, despite the narrow window of the shortest recession ever. It just took a while for the economic data to catch up.”</p>\n\n<p>As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recession lasted only two months, the shortest on record, but also one of the steepest, the economy contracting more in just two months than any other recession back to 1948.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.20.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>So what happens now?</p>\n\n<p>Based on history, we are likely in for several more years of economic expansion. Expansions are on no particular timetable but the average length of an expansion does tell us something about how long it usually takes for the kind of economic excesses to build up that usually cause recessions. While post-World War II expansions have lasted as little as 12 months, the average is more than five years and the last four expansions have averaged over eight years.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.20.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Absent an unexpected shock, we would not be on the lookout for a recession until the Federal Reserve (Fed) raises its policy rate several times. Recessions are usually accompanied by an inverted yield curve, where short-term interests are higher than long-term rates, not the normal situation. Since the Fed has a lot of influence over short-term interest rates, they often play some role in the yield curve inverting. The Fed usually won’t start to raise rates until the economy starts to strengthen and will continue to raise rates as it heats up. Raising rates several times is a signal that excesses have started to build that make the economy more vulnerable to a recession. Raising rates also adds to that vulnerability by pushing up short-term borrowing costs.</p>\n\n<p>While rate hike expectations have come forward, they still put a recession several years away. In the Fed policy committee’s latest economic projections, the consensus view was for no rate hikes in 2021 or 2022, and two rate hikes in 2023. While those projections will change based on what’s actually happening in the economy, if it held true it likely would not be enough to signal increased danger of a recession.</p>\n\n<p>But just because we don’t see a recession on the horizon does not mean it’s an all clear for markets. As discussed in our Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed, we do still view the overall economic backdrop as supportive. But we are also in the second year of a bull market, which tends to be choppier than the first year, although the S&amp;P 500 Index does typically still see gains.</p>\n\n<p>NBER’s announcement is something to celebrate, but it does not signal smooth sailing ahead. Still, most bear markets are associated with recessions, and with plenty of fiscal stimulus still in play, the Fed’s policy rate still near zero, and the labor market continuing to see strong improvement, even if slower than expected, absent a shock we are not expecting a recession any time soon, and that’s usually good news for markets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h6><strong>([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())</strong></h6>\n\n<p>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</p>\n\n<h6><strong>([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())</strong></h6>\n\n<p>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Gzq3pvf.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/GQYUlEj.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY&#39;S MARKET OPEN!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp;
