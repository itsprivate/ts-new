  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What? I could still get a 100% return even with a high stock price, how?</strong> There is nothing, absolutely nothing in the entire world that would ever keep GameStop&#39;s price at or above the levels they are today in the next 10 years. There was, however, 150% short interest on the float.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s simplify this: You have 1 🍎 that you cut into 10 slices. 10 Slices are the outstanding shares. You give 2 🍎 slices to your friends and these become restricted. You go to a Farmer&#39;s Market and take your 8 🍎 slices with you to sell. This is the float.</p>\n\n<p>Someone comes along and thinks 🍎 prices will tank, so they want to short the market. They think it will tank so badly they want to short more than the total number of 🍎 that are available on the market. Hedge Funds can do this (for now).</p>\n\n<p><strong>That seems crazy, what does it mean though?</strong> In order to short 🍎 a hedge has to &quot;borrow&quot; them. They pay interest on this. The longer time it takes for the price of an 🍎 to go down, the more interest they have to pay. Also, if the price of 🍎 skyrocket, the person who is lending out 🍎 might claw them back, forcing the shorter to pay a high price to close out their short.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So when do I make $10,000 / share and retire?</strong> That&#39;s never going to happen...sorry. People are claiming if you set your limit sell order to an absurd number eventually a short has to buy it to cover. Most brokerages will limit the level above the strike you can set a limit. However, there is still a large % of the stock being shorted. It&#39;s possible that is several million of those shorts need to close, they would have to buy the stock at a very high price ($312.01 or possibly higher) and this would likely cause the stock to start climbing higher and higher as the shareholders don&#39;t want to sell their stock for a low price.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you say Gamestop was a terrible company</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Gamestop is a terrible company. You literally have to be the biggest idiot in the world to think that Gamestop is worth more money than (throwing out a popular company name that is now smaller in market cap, BEST BUY). I&#39;ve seen so many bandwagon investors with $5 in their trading account buying a fractional share because &quot;the GameStop at my mall is always busy&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And?</p>\n\n<p>Other genius ideas I&#39;ve seen on Reddit:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>&quot;GameStop should get into custom pc builds, that would be huge!&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;GameStop should do &#39;paint-n-sip&#39; type parties for gamers, that&#39;s a rock-solid business&quot;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Anyone with these ideas has no idea how a business functions, what a TAM (total addressable market) is, or has ever looked at the GameStop balance sheet from any of the past earnings reports. <strong>GameStop is a dying business, it is Blockbuster, it is Netflix had Netflix kept trying to mail people DvD&#39;s instead of streaming.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Remember what happened to bc in 2017....that&#39;s going to happen with $GME at some point, it&#39;s not for certain when or how high the price could go before it comes down, but it will come down. If shorts closing out positions make the price go up, in order to cash out shareholders need to sell those shares. At a certain point, the shorts will be done and shareholders will be selling to others who think the price can keep going. Those people who don&#39;t understand anything about the market and just think they&#39;re going to make thousands or millions overnight are going to be the ones who end up losing virtually all of their investment if they got to the party late.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why can&#39;t GameStop be a good company, how do you know anything?</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I run a venture capital firm, I invest in companies and am looking at the future outlook of the business, what companies should be valued, will it be worth it to put $$ in them and what is the likelihood I will make money on that investment.</li>\n<li>GameStop could turn things around, by doing 1 thing. Going digital. Think about Steam, Stadia, Epic Games....even Apple Arcade on Apple TV. Tech is catching up, everything will be digital. Do you really think that if someone opened up a video game rental store with discs, or a DVD rental store with discs it would become an insanely popular valuable company? No. But nonstop new companies start streaming content...and those do become popular.</li>\n<li>Also, take into consideration 5G is here, although not everywhere. 5G is going to enable a lot of people to see significantly higher download speeds than they have even if they have 1gbps with Fios or any other traditional provider, stuff like this is only going to get faster and faster to the point that you literally will be able to stream a game in 4k UHD without even downloading it beforehand.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Remember, just because it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that the stock could go up due to the short interest, there is no guarantee it does. Don&#39;t risk more money than you&#39;re willing to lose and don&#39;t buy into a lot of the hype you read on Reddit. 99.99% of the people on here now throwing out financial advice don&#39;t know anything.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it. If you were so good at investing that you made a fortune...why would you tell other people how to do it? This would limit your ability to continue doing exactly what you do without being arbitraged by others.  </p>\n\n<p>Positions: 1,000 shares of $GME most of which came from exercising option calls weeks to months ago.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
