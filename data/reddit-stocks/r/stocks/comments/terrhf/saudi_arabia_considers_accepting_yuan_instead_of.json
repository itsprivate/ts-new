Saudi officials have said they were shocked by the precipitous [U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-u-s-troops-leave-afghanistan-after-nearly-20-years-11630355853?mod=article_inline) last year.\n\nChina buys more than 25% of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports. If priced in yuan, those sales would boost the standing of China’s currency. The Saudis are also considering including yuan-denominated futures contracts, known as the petroyuan, in the pricing model of [Saudi Arabian Oil Co](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SA/XSAU/2222). , known as Aramco.\n\nIt would be a profound shift for Saudi Arabia to price even some of its roughly 6.2 million barrels of day of crude exports in anything other than dollars. The majority of [global oil sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-03-15-2022-11647333255?mod=article_inline)—around 80%—are done in dollars, and the Saudis have traded oil exclusively in dollars since 1974, in a deal with the Nixon administration that included security guarantees for the kingdom. \n\nChina [introduced yuan-priced oil contracts in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-attempts-to-supplant-dollar-face-historic-difficulties-1522063947?mod=article_inline) as part of its efforts to make its currency tradable across the world, but they haven’t made a dent in the dollar’s dominance of the oil market. For China, using dollars has become a hazard highlighted by U.S. sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program and on Russia in response to [the Ukraine invasion](https://wsj.com/livecoverage/latest-updates/russia-ukraine-latest-news).\n\nChina has stepped up its courtship of the Saudi kingdom. In recent years, China has helped Saudi Arabia [build its own ballistic missiles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-begin-making-ballistic-missiles-with-chinese-help-11640294886?mod=article_inline), consulted on a nuclear program and begun investing in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s pet projects, [such as Neom](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crown-princes-vision-for-neom-a-desert-city-state-tests-his-builders-11619870401?mod=article_inline), a futuristic new city. Saudi Arabia has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping [to visit later this year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-invites-chinas-xi-to-visit-kingdom-amid-strained-u-s-relations-11647284211?reflink=mobilewebshare_twitter&amp;mod=article_inline).\n\nMeanwhile the Saudi relationship with the U.S. has deteriorated under President Biden, who said in the 2020 campaign that [the kingdom should be a “pariah](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-urged-to-penalize-saudi-crown-prince-over-khashoggi-killing-11614546231?mod=article_inline)” for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Prince Mohammed, who U.S. intelligence authorities say ordered Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, refused to sit in on a call between Mr. Biden and the Saudi ruler, King Salman, last month.\n\nIt also comes as the U.S. economic relationship with the Saudis is diminishing. The U.S. is now among the top oil producers in the world. It once imported 2 million barrels of Saudi crude a day in the early 1990s but those numbers have fallen to less than 500,000 barrels a day in December 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nBy contrast, China’s oil imports have swelled over the last three decades, in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Arabia was China’s top crude supplier in 2021, selling at 1.76 million barrels a day, followed by Russia at 1.6 million barrels a day, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs.\n\n“The dynamics have dramatically changed. The U.S. relationship with the Saudis has changed, China is the world’s biggest crude importer and they are offering many lucrative incentives to the kingdom,” said a Saudi official familiar with the talks.\n\n“China has been offering everything you could possibly imagine to the kingdom,” the official said.",
