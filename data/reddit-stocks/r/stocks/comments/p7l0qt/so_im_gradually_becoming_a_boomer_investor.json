I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment.

But in 21 they are a far better play.\n\n\nMy advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor.

Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well.
