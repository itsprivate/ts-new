Data Center revenue was $3.81 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 61% from the prior year.\n&gt;\n&gt;The shortfall relative to the May revenue outlook of $8.10 billion was primarily attributable to lower sell-in of Gaming products reflecting a reduction in channel partner sales likely due to macroeconomic headwinds.
