Data Center revenue was $3.81 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 61% from the prior year.\n&gt;\n&gt;The shortfall relative to the May revenue outlook of $8.10 billion was primarily attributable to lower sell-in of Gaming products reflecting a reduction in channel partner sales likely due to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition to reducing sell-in, the company implemented pricing programs with channel partners to reflect challenging market conditions that are expected to persist into the third quarter.\n&gt;\n&gt;Data Center revenue, though a record, was somewhat short of the company’s expectations, as it was impacted by supply chain disruptions.\nSecond quarter results are expected to include approximately $1.32 billion of charges, primarily for inventory and related reserves, based on revised expectations of future demand.\n&gt;\n&gt;“Our gaming product sell-through projections declined significantly as the quarter progressed,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “As we expect the macroeconomic conditions affecting sell-through to continue, we took actions with our Gaming partners to adjust channel prices and inventory.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-announces-preliminary-financial-results-130000607.html",
