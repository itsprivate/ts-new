This is part of growing and learning as an investor.</p>\n\n<p>But the thing that many people forget is the <strong>almost</strong> trades. Those trades that we got close to pulling the trigger on, but didn&#39;t. Whatever that reason was, we all have moves that we almost made but <em>something</em> made us pass on it. </p>\n\n<h1>Write them down.</h1>\n\n<p>Record every trade that you almost made, or considered making. Record the date, the current value, and the reason you didn&#39;t make the trade.</p>\n\n<p>This has been very valuable to me in my first few weeks of trading. We all look through our portfolio and our trade history and think, &quot;man - if only I held this longer&quot; or &quot;I really messed up buying this on the rise&quot;. But what we often forget is to give ourselves credit the the decisions we made that there isn&#39;t a history of on our chosen broker. For every single regret we have as traders, there is a dodged bullet that our gut, training, or education helped us avoid. On the flip side, there are also those securities we saw a post about, or noticed while browsing that sparked something in us but we hesitated on. Those ones that have been nothing but green since then and we are regretting.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t record the moves you <strong>almost</strong> made, then you&#39;re missing out on valuable person growth information that can help you become a better trader. Write down every move you almost made in a notebook and look back every once in a while. The more you write at the time the better.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this can help others as much as it&#39;s helped me. Good luck y&#39;all!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
