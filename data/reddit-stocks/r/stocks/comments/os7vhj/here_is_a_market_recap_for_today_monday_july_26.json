  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 26, 2021**\n\nThe stock market carried on its momentum from last week, with all three major indexes (S&P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), and Dow Jones (DIA)) powering to new record highs despite last Monday’s steep decline, a sign that market participants remain eager and able to buy up any dips in the broader market. It seems market participants continue to weigh a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the Delta variant.\n\nOver the last several weeks, market participants have been gauging the likelihood that the spread of highly contagious coronavirus Delta-variant could begin to pressure the ongoing economic recovery in the US. Last week, concerns came to a head after several local counties in the US, including Los Angeles, re-implemented the mask mandate in order to try and curb the spread.  In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 51,939 on July 25, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. \n\nHowever, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nDavid Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “We \\[Goldman Sachs\\] think the Delta variant should pose a minimal risk to the US equity market. From an economic perspective, widespread vaccinations and strategies focused on containment suggest limited medical and economic downside even if infections continue to rise. From a flows perspective, robust household cash balances and corporate buyback authorizations should continue to support inflows for equities, increasing the likelihood that market participants perceive a pullback as a buying opportunity”\n\nLater this week, investors will hear from Federal Reserve officials over the path forward for monetary policy, which will likely be informed by the increased concerns over the Delta variant and peaking economic growth rates. Analysts are predicting that the downside risks still present in the economy will continue to overshadow potential worries over inflation, which means members of the Fed are very unlikely to make any changes in the upcoming meeting. What I am most interested in from these meetings is hearing about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing (QE). I expect the Fed will make some kind of announcement regarding this before the year ends. The real test for equities is coming in 2023, when the interest rate is expected to begin rising.\n\nQ2 earnings season is shaping up to be another record-breaking quarter, with corporate earnings continuing to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers. So far, 24% of the companies in the SPY have reported, and of these, 88% have so far topped analyst estimates, according to FactSet. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* As I was writing the recap, Tesla beat earning estimates, recording revenue of $11.96 billion, better than the $11.3 billion expected and up from $6.04 billion a year earlier. \n* Shares of Chinese stocks remain under heavy pressure, with investors spooked by the latest actions of the Chinese government. This comes after the CCP hammered ride-hailing company Didi, whose stock is more than 40% below IPO price after the CCP threatened to slap them with a record fine and pull the stock from US listing. Moreover, the CCP is forcing private-education companies into becoming nonprofits in an effort to lower the cost of education. \n* This week a lot of mega-cap tech stocks are reporting earnings, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) set to report this week. \n* Bank of America (BAC) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend on the 24th of September to US$0.21. This takes the annual payment to 2.0% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\\*\\***\n* Amazon (AMZN) target raised by Credit Suisse from $4000 to $4850 at Outperform. Stock currently around $3695\n* Celanese (CE) with two target raises. Stock currently around $154\n   * Wells Fargo from $183 to $186 at Overweight\n   * Barclays from $180 to $185 at Overweight\n* Facebook (FB) target raised by Mizuho from $400 to $450 at Buy. Stock currently around $373\n* Generac (GNRC) target raised by KeyCrop from $400 to $500 at Overweight. Stock currently around $445\n* Roper Technologies (ROP) with two target raises. Stock currently around $490\n   * Royal Bank of Canada from $499 to $556 at Outperform\n   * Barclays from $510 to $550 at Overweight\n* SVB Financial (SIVB) with two target raises.
