I find it hard to believe, despite all the volatility in the recent market, that the negatives won’t reverse in due time.\n\nTLDR: long term investors who don’t actively sell stocks (have been in the market for ~5+ years), was your portfolio ever down, if so how much, and has it since recovered/ put you in profit zone?\n\nThanks",
