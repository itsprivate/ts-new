It just bounced off the 200EMA at $34, and it making its way up to the 50MA at $53. There&#39;s a big gap between those prices, and NIO could bounce around between $40 and $44 before deciding which way to go.</p>\n\n<p>There are bull and bear cases for NIO in the short term. They have announced recent strong partnerships with manufacturing companies and are building more factories to expand their deliveries. They also are releasing new vehicles and have announced tech partnerships for autonomous driving.  But they are affected by the chip shortage that is ravaging the auto market. And they are also facing tremendous competition in China and abroad from TSLA and VOW for their mid-size SUVs.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re holding NIO, it would be a good time to start hedging. Either selling covered calls at 0.25 delta (around $53) or buying long dated puts. I would suggest $30 puts for May 21 which are sitting at $2.00 right now. Paying $200 for downside protection given that NIO may fall to $28 which is the October support level below the 200MA is a reasonable ask. If it does fall, I suspect NIO will fall hard and fast, allowing the PUT to help absorb some of the loss potential.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, this is just some cautious advice given some warning signs that are flashing. I think NIO is a winner long term, but 2021 may be a tough year where the gains made in 2020 may level out and even recede until more reliable results are provided by NIO.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
