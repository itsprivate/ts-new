But instead of debating about whether or not that’s true, let’s first look at if it’s even accurate to assume that most Tesla buyers are democrats.\n\nLuckily, theres data for that and the results were disclosed in Feb ‘22. [Leta take a look at the key findings of that survey.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/cars/tesla-buyer-politics/index.html) Keep in mind, these results came out long before his latest claim to be voting Republican. \n\nFirst finding: “Surveys by research firm Morning Consult show that in January about 22% of Democrats were considering buying a Tesla, while 17% of Republicans were looking to purchase one”\n\nSecond: “And Republicans are slightly more likely to trust the Tesla brand, 27% compared to 25% among Democrats.”\n\nOkay so far it’s looking pretty equal today. But how about in the past?\n\nThird: “Data from Strategic Vision, which has surveyed hundreds of thousands of car buyers, shows that since 2019, 38% of Tesla buyers have identified themselves as Democrats, and 30% have said they're Republicans. That's slightly less \"liberal\" than EV buyers overall, who skew 41% Democratic to 27% Republican.”\n\nSo definitely a higher percentage being democrat. But far from the majority. \n\nAnd I saved the best for last: “Figures from the Internal Revenue Service show that only 22% of those claiming the credit had adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less, while 32% earned between $100,000 and $200,000, and another 43% earned between $200,000 and $500,000. The remaining 4% earned more than $1 million.”\n\nSo Tesla buyers are rich. Though this data is only from people who were able to claim the $7,500 credit which as been long gone.\n\nAnd lastly: “The primary motivator to buy a Tesla is not because customers want to reduce greenhouse gases, Edwards said. His data show performance and styling are the biggest draws for most buyers.”\n\nMy conclusion: It seems to me like whether someone is a democrat or not isn’t as much of a factor as Reddit assumes. Having enough money to buy one is. As is Tesla maintaining its “cool factor”.",
