The May 2021 CPI reported yesterday shows a 5% jump YoY in all categories with an apparently HUGE jump of 28.5 % YoY when looking at energy.</p>\n\n<p>However it seems that most people, and the media, are forgetting that 1 year ago, May 2020 was when the whole economy was depressed due to the lockdowns.  For energy in particular, in May 2020 the oil futures unprecedently went negative! </p>\n\n<p>The apparent YoY spike is actually due to a base effect, or that the denominator of your calculation is smaller than usual.  You can take a look at the 20-year monthly CPI increase here: <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>For all categories, in May 2020 the CPI YoY increase was 0.1% . To smooth over the Covid crash, we can look at the CPI increase between May 2021 and May 2019. Mathematically this is the geometric average and it comes out to what you&#39;d expect: 2.5%  . As you can see on the graph, the 2.5% YoY is actually quite average for the period of 2016-2019. This means that the current value of the CPI is roughly what we would have got had there been no covid and the usual inflation growth.</p>\n\n<p>For energy, which apparently had the huge spike, the case is even stronger that this is simply a base effect, indicating the economy is returning to normal. The YoY increase on May 2020 was -18.9%. If you take the geometric average: square root( 0.811 * 1.285) you get an average increase of ONLY 2% . I say only, because the average CPI increase over the last year has been as high as 8-9%. So 2% increase is actually close to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the take away? Inflation fears are overblown and the Fed is right to say that this is a temporary effect. We are returning to normal, it just seems much more because we&#39;ve been locked down for a year and prices were depressed due to the lockdown. In particular, I would load up on tech/growth stocks which took a hit due to rising inflation. The numbers simply don&#39;t point to the fears that we will enter a new era of high inflation.</p>\n\n<p>Tldr; inflation is not real, buy growth stocks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
