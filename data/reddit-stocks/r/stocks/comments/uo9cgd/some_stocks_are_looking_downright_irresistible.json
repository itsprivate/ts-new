PYPL - Currently trading at a price it hasn't seen since 2018, and is at the lowest P/E in its entire history. The last time the P/E was anywhere near this low was back in 2016. At that time PYPL's EPS was $1\\`.11. It's now at $3.03. So it's trading at levels not seen in years but is earning triple what it was earning back then.\n2. GOOG - Currently trading at the lowest P/E in more than 7 years. It came close to this level back in 2019, when it was earning $49.50/share. It's now earning $110.50, more than double what it was earning then.\n3. DOCU - Currently trading at a P/S of 6.3. The last time it was at this sales ratio was back in 2019, pre-COVID. At that time it was generating $7.84/share in revenue. It's now generating $10.70/share. Gross margins are higher now too.\n4. CHWY - Currently trading below its IPO price at the dirt cheap P/S of 1.1. The previous lowest P/S was 3.2, back at the IPO when it was generating $13.40/share in revenue. It's now generating $21.30/share in revenue on higher gross margins.\n\nBottom line: there are some companies out there trading at or below past levels despite generating considerably more earnings or sales now than they were back then. The unprofitable ones will rebound more slowly, but these are the higher quality companies that the smart money will start snapping up when it looks like the dust is settling. So be ready.",
