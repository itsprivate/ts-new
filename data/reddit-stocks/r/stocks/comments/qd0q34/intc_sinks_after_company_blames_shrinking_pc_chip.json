That includes PC chip revenue.\n\nPC sales have been strong for the last year as consumers around the world needed new laptops and desktops to work from home. But the pandemic-related PC surge may be coming to a close as sales slow, according to analysts.\n\nIntel said that PC sales were down primarily due to lower laptop volumes because of the chip shortage.\n\nIntel’s Data Center Group, which sells processors and other silicon for data centers, produced $6.5 billion in sales, up 10% year-over-year, but fell short of analyst estimates of $6.66 billion.\n\nIntel is in a period of massive capital expenditure as it spends $20 billion this year, including on a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. Investors are closely watching Intel’s gross margin as the company spends on ramping up new production lines to catch rivals in semiconductor performance.\n\nMore here: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/intel-intc-earnings-q3-2021.html",
