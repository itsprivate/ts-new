(NASDAQ:TSLA) will make up for 1.69% of the S&amp;P 500 index as it makes its debut on Monday’s open, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt.</p>\n\n<p>What Happened: Silverblatt said S&amp;P 500’s price-earnings ratio for the coming year will increase from 22.3 to 22.6 with the electric vehicle maker’s addition, CNBC reported Sunday. For every $11.1 Tesla moves, the S&amp;P 500 will fluctuate by one point, as per the analyst.</p>\n\n<p>S&amp;P 500’s dividend yield will dip from 1.56% to 1.53%, Silverblatt said in a note, as per CNBC.</p>\n\n<p>Why It Matters: Tesla will become the fifth largest constituent of the S&amp;P 500 on Monday with the 1.69% weighting.</p>\n\n<p>See Also: Tesla&#39;s Valuation Is Greater Than Nearly The Entire Established Auto Industry</p>\n\n<p>Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the charts with 6.47%, according to Silverblatt. Other companies ahead of the Elon Musk-led automaker include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon .com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB).</p>\n\n<p>Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Class A and Class C shares have 1.66% and 1.61% weighting, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs analysts last week said Tesla’s addition to S&amp;P 500 will not make the index more expensive, noting that the aggregate index P/E multiple of S&amp;P 500 will be lifted by slightly less than 1.5% on the EV maker’s inclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla is replacing Apartment Investment and Management Co (NYSE:AIV) in the index.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
