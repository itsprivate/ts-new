Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon &amp; a couple of other stocks.</p>\n\n<p>I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon &amp; others.</p>\n\n<p>Small-caps &amp; value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.</p>\n\n<p>Just take a look at this <a href=\"https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt\">chart</a> &amp; you can see that small &amp; mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid &amp; small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% &amp; 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow &amp; SP500.</p>\n\n<p>Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Inflation &amp; Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My short answer is <strong>NO</strong>. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages &amp; other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe &amp; the US.</p>\n\n<p>Though you can see the total money <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S\">supply</a> for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package &amp; proposed infrastructure bill.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED &amp; mostly everyone is already expecting this.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y\">yields</a>, maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks &amp; especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA\">Inflation</a> hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy &amp; given the fact that most participants for a recent <a href=\"https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr\">survey</a> think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest <a href=\"https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn\">concern</a> though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. FED Rates.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest <a href=\"https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC\">rate</a> and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.</p>\n\n<p>Right <a href=\"https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs\">now</a>, that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://imgur.com/s0avQp0\">DOT-PLOT</a> of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.</p>\n\n<p>The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent <a href=\"https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh\">interview</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We can see in the latest <a href=\"https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy\">projections</a> by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.</p>\n\n<p>This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with <a href=\"https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo\">Goldman</a> expecting a 7% growth for 2021.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Deceiving unemployment numbers.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We have seen <a href=\"https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB\">jobless</a> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/70bI1tP\">claims</a> getting <a href=\"https://imgur.com/x6azae0\">better</a> in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.</p>\n\n<p>Nonfarm payrolls also <a href=\"https://imgur.com/7jsI57U\">smashed</a> expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.</p>\n\n<p>It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS\">compared</a> to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The 6% unemployment <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE\">rate</a> is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE\">U6 unemployment</a> leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.</p>\n\n<p>It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs <a href=\"https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc\">created</a> last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure &amp; hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH\">compared</a> to previous years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Suez Canal blockage</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P\">This</a> created an even bigger <a href=\"https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc\">stress</a> on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen <a href=\"https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1\">OPEC</a> planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>EVs</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK\">NIO</a> delivered over 20k in Q1, <a href=\"https://imgur.com/61piwPA\">Ford</a> grew EV sales by more than 70% and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6\">Tesla</a> beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.</p>\n\n<p>Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper &amp; cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 &amp; model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla &amp; their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.</p>\n\n<p>EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which <a href=\"https://imgur.com/scynXTS\">includes</a> $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Economic Readings</strong></p>\n\n<p>The consumer confidence <a href=\"https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL\">spiked</a> last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices &amp; inflation possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU\">ISM</a> Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/duUr0u6\">composite</a> PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>The Greed / Fear of The Market</strong></p>\n\n<p>Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy <a href=\"https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh\">paradigm</a>. People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism &amp; euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation &amp; discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.</p>\n\n<p>Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech &amp; small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear &amp; Greed <a href=\"https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT\">Index</a> bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.</p>\n\n<p>These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/RN30kuW\">Keep</a> an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless &amp; unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F\">economy</a> continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!
