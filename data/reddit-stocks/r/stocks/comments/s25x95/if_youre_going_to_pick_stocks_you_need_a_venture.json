So, I decided to dig deeper into the rationale behind this advice to understand how I might make stock picking work.\n\nIn a 2018 [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447), Hendrik Bessembinder posed the question \"Do Stocks Outperform Treasury Bills?\" Bessembinder looked at all common stocks in the Center for Research in Security Prices database from 1926 to 2016, and compared their returns against one-month Treasury bills, the capitalization‐weighted average return, and the equal‐weighted average return.\n\n**Common Stock Returns at Various Horizons**\n\n||Month|Year|Decade|Lifetime|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|% of stocks beating one-month T-Bill|47.8%|51.6%|49.5%|42.6%|\n|% of stocks beating cap-weighted average|46.3%|44.4%|37.3%|30.8%|\n|% of stocks beating equal-weighted average|45.9%|42.5%|33.6%|26.1%|\n\nFrom the study, we see that only 51.6% of stocks held for a year beat the return of a one-month T-bill! Furthermore, only 26.1% of stocks held for their entire lifetime beat the equal-weighted return. The odds are not stacked in your favour.\n\nPicking stocks at random is very likely to underperform an index over the long-term. You're probably not even going to beat short-dated Treasuries. If one is going to pick stocks, how does one overcome these odds?\n\nI found this part of the study particularly revealing:\n\n&gt;It is well known that returns to early stage equity investments, such as venture capital, are highly risky and positively skewed, as most investments generate losses that are offset by large gains on a few investments. The evidence here shows that such a payoff distribution is not only confined to pre-Initial Public Offering investments but also characterizes the structure of longer term returns to investments in public equity, particularly smaller firms and firms listed in recent decades.\n\nTherefore I conclude, to be a successful stock picker one must think like a venture capitalist. But how does one embody this mindset? How does venture investing work?\n\nThat's beyond the scope of this post, it's something I want to investigate in future. But I think [this article](https://www.toptal.com/finance/venture-capital-consultants/venture-capital-portfolio-strategy) is a good place to start:\n\n* **Home Runs Matter** \\- Swinging for the fences means that you will make misses. But strike-out (poor return) investments don't matter if a home run is hit.\n* **Finding Home Runs** \\- Follow the philosophy of classic venture investing by making contrarian bets into companies that display strong characteristics of team, addressable market, scalability, unfair advantage, and timing coincidence.\n* **Following On Is Critical** \\- 66% of the money in a VC fund should be reserved for following-on. This is the process of investing in the future rounds of existing portfolio investments. A mistake that many a VC fund can make is to quickly invest all of its capital and leave no dry powder for follow-on investments. Follow-ons are a true test of a venture manager, facing the sunk-cost fallacy of deciding to pour more money after a bad investment, or to back a winner.\n\nIn future, I want to explore the venture capital approach in detail because I'm convinced it's the key to being a successful stock picker.\n\n*I am not a financial advisor, please make your own judgements.*",
