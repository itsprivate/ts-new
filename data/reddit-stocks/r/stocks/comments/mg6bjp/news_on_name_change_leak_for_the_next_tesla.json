Volkswagen American depository receipts, or ADRs, rise 5.2% Monday. What’s more, the stock has gained more than 64% year to date. Shares shot up earlier this month after the company laid out more ambitious EV goals.</p>\n\n<p>The name change isn’t the only thing affecting shares. The stock is getting a lift after an upgrade by Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois. On Sunday, he raised his rating to Buy from Hold and increased his price target for preferred stock to about $350 a share from $235.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
