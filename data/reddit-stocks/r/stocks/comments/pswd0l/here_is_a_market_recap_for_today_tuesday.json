If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrande’s lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s said, it was unlikely that Evergrande’s default would cause a credit crisis “by itself” but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, “Banks’ exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for China’s financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time.” \n\nIn other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Wednesday. The monetary policy statement and subsequent press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon will lay out what the Fed thinks of the current state of the economy and potential signal when the Fed will begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. \n\nJulia Coronado, President of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said “I think on balance the Fed is still marching forward. They're going to tell us that they're about to taper this year, or their plan is still to taper this year. That sets up November or maybe December as a formal announcement. So this meeting is really not about doing anything, it's just about reminding us that the economy is making progress, the recovery is under way and the Fed is beginning a very gradual process of normalizing, as they like to say, monetary policy.\"\n\nThe policy decision will also come alongside an updated economic projection from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, including the first look at their expectations for 2024. Based on the central bank's latest projections from June, the FOMC's \"dot plot,\" or chart of interest rate expectations, suggested the median member expected two rate hikes by the end of 2023.\n\n**Sorry no highlights again today**\n\n*\"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\"* \\-Eleanor Roosevelt",
