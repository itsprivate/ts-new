[Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u5ujf3/wsj_shipping_stocks_will_sink_as_us_consumers/) and [Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tz6r47/container_shipping_rates_are_going_mad_again_read/). Both saw some pushback, so I am excited to again share yet another sign that things are getting better.\n\nBut that's not all! [Port bottlenecks are easing](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/34944-major-shipping-firm-sees-signs-of-supply-chain-bottlenecks-easing)!!\n\nI'll highlight the snippets: \n\n\n&gt; Port bottlenecks that have increased supply chain congestion because of the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China may be showing signs of easing, according to one of the world’s biggest shipping companies.\n\n&gt; Currently, **the number of ships waiting outside of the ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach have been reduced to less than 40, from more than 100 earlier this year** [...]The waiting time for ships at Shanghai ports is two or three days, compared with 10 to 14 days at the U.S. ports. \n\n&gt; “I think this is a good sign that the port congestion has been easing” in the U.S., Cheng said in an interview Tuesday. “We foresee in the second half, everything will become smooth. All the difficulties will be easier.”\n\n&gt; As for China’s strict lockdowns in Shanghai and other cities to battle COVID-19 outbreaks, he sees the global impact as a “short-term phenomenon” that should be limited to second-quarter operations. He expects Beijing to adjust its Covid policy, and the nation’s economy to rebound in the second half of the year.\n\n&gt; While shipping operations are improving in Shanghai and factories are gradually restarting, containers are still piling up in ports because of a shortage of trucks. Once bunched-up cargo vessels start sailing again, logistics experts warn of a flood of containers clogging U.S. and European ports.\n\n&gt; Congestion in Shanghai ports has increased about 30% to 40% as of April 25 since the beginning of March, though it’s still lower than the peak during the third quarter last year, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said in an emailed report Thursday. With bottlenecks in northern Chinese ports, vessels are seeking alternatives, which will likely increase congestion in southern ports, the report said.\n\n&gt; Global trade growth is projected to slow to 5% this year from an estimated 10.1% in 2021, according to an International Monetary Fund report.\n\n&gt; Cheng expects measures by the U.S. government to speed flows at ports — such as rules to immediately move empty containers — will gradually kick in and ease the congestion in the second half. Once the logjams improve, he said, it will lead to lower freight rates.\n\n&gt; A major uncertainty for next year is whether the market can digest the supply of new ships built over the past few years amid an industry upcycle. **Growth in supply in 2023 is expected to double from this year**, outpacing rising demand, Cheng said, citing a forecast from Alphaliner.\n\nI'm not done, trucking is also [cooling down](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bank-of-america-is-sounding-the-alarm-on-collapsing-freight-demand).\n\n&gt; Trucking demand is “near freight recession levels,” according to Bank of America. Shippers’ outlook on rates, capacity and inventory levels are matching attitudes not seen since May and June 2020, when pandemic lockdowns sent freight volumes into a historic decline.\n\n&gt; Ken Hoexter, the managing director of Bank of America’s trucking research, wrote that **shippers’ view of demand is down 23% year-over-year. The proprietary Truckload Demand Indicator hit 58 — the lowest since June 2020.** \n\n&gt; Hoexter said the shippers’ view of rates have “melt(ed) down,” hitting a low not seen since May 2020. Bank of America’s survey represented views from 44 shippers in industries including retail, consumer goods and manufacturing.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, these **shippers are finding it easy to find capacity to move their loads; outlook on capacity hit its highest level since June 2020. They also noted their view on inventory levels had climbed to its highest point since May 2020.**\n\n&gt; One key indicator is the FreightWaves SONAR Outbound Tender Reject Index (SONAR: OTRI.USA) . **At this time last year, truckers were rejecting a whopping 25.76% of loads they had previously arranged through contract**. That indicated they were able to find better loads through the spot market, where shipments are available on demand. Now that spot market rates have declined, more drivers are moving their contracted loads. **As of Sunday, the rejection rate had sunk to 9.92%.**",
