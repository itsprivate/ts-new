I’m saving up  money to move in with my girlfriend at the end of July. $135 a week is about what I would need, but in case I mess up I’m going to be putting $150 into it. I currently make about $2,000 a month working at a gas station. I’m going to DoorDash for a 2nd job while going to college. My rent is $1,087, my electric is $125, my bills are about $525. My gasoline cost is about $120 an usually my groceries cost me about $50 a month. Before DoorDashing I would only have $93 left over. I do get paid tomorrow, but as of right now I have $1 in my bank account. \nI know this is completely stupid an extremely risky to basically make my savings account my investment portfolio, but really what choice do I have? If you don’t generate capital in a capitalist system then you can never get ahead.\nI’m going to try to have some fun with my piss poor reality. Each week until I move out in July, I’m going to be buying $150 worth of different stocks, using different techniques an I will be selling them all at the end of July.\nHere are the current shares I have:\nNAKD - 7 shares - $5.40\nPROG - 16 shares - $2.25\nPTON - 1 Share - $35.20\nSIRI - 2 Shares - $6.36\nBIOL - 4 Shares - $0.42\n\nWish me luck, I will detail my journey each week",
