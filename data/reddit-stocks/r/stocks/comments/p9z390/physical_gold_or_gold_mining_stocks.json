I know that some gold mining projects are booming right now, so I started on some mining stocks recently.\n\nI already have my profile started with some senior and junior stocks (because they said to diversify). I have some Lundin Gold ([LUG.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/lug.to/)). They recently announced the production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year. They have the Fruta Del Norte gold mine which they purchased in late 2014 and now has 100% ownership of it. Its first commercial production was achieved in February 2020.\n\nI did not miss investing in Newmont Corporation ([NEM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NEM/)) of course, which basically has the largest gold reserve, with their latest advancement being the acquisition of GT Gold. The latter has been exploring British Columbia’s Golden Triangle, and is focused on mining base precious metals. The acquisition brought them the Tattoga project, and they exceeded their 2020 conversion target by 80 percent.\n\nRecently I have some plans to invest in some more junior stocks because the upside potential is way higher. I just started investing some on Collective Mining ([CNL.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNL.V/)), which boasts the Guayabales Project situated in Colombia. They recently discovered high grade silver in a new porphyry-vein. They’re doing really great, having a blockbuster IPO that saw the stock pop 205% on the first day of trading. Their cash burn is also impressively low, so it seems like the company is set up for a long timeline. Recently they just announced that it had received $13.5 million from the exercise of common share purchase warrants on August 10 at an exercise price of $2.00.\n\nI know these are all mining stocks, but some people advised me to start investing in physical gold (and silver) and warned me against investing in these stocks. Advice from you guys will definitely help.",
