We are incapable of objective evaluation of our own competency levels. I&#39;m writing about it as I&#39;ve come to realise I suffer from it.</p>\n\n<p>Dunning and Kruger&#39;s main finding from their 1999 study “Unskilled and Unaware of it” was that the worst performers consistently overestimate their ability relative to others.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve outlined two examples of this bias in action and how you can avoid some of these pitfalls:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Investing</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As the age old saying goes, &quot;Everyone is a genius in a bull market.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When your portfolio is growing and the markets are ripping as they have in 2020, many fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We tend to wrongly attribute this performance to our ability as talented investors.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Politics</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>An obvious example people have been using recently is Donald Trump, whose confidence never wavers, despite his weak interest and understanding of policy matters.</p>\n\n<p>The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don&#39;t know you&#39;re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. But we&#39;re all human, and it&#39;s important to recognise that we are all prone to this cognitive bias.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few strategies to avoid it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Identify your circle of competence</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The circle of competence is a sacred place. It&#39;s a set of topics or areas that align with a person&#39;s expertise. Be ruthless in identifying and protecting the boundaries, and it&#39;s usually smaller than you think.</p>\n\n<p>As Charlie Munger said, &quot;It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of being very intelligent.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Know your competencies, focus on them. Know your incompetencies, avoid or outsource them.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Be a first principles thinker</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition - it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions. In chemistry, it&#39;s like an element. It cannot be broken down further.</p>\n\n<p>Ground yourself in foundational truths and build up from there. Challenge your reasoning, and most importantly, always ask why.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It isn&#39;t what you don&#39;t know that gets you in trouble. It&#39;s what you know for sure that just isn&#39;t so.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Link to original: <a href=\"https://mrsk.substack.com/p/everyone-is-a-genius-in-a-bull-market\">https://mrsk.substack.com/p/everyone-is-a-genius-in-a-bull-market</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
