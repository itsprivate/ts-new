On my brokerage account it was showing cost per share as $7 and now that it’s registered, it much higher, almost sounds like whatever the stock was trading at the time of transfer. This is quite annoying as I was extremely cautious of not increasing my cost per share above where I had purchased.\n\nDid I make a big mistake? If I transfer back to my brokerage, will it revert to my original cost per share? Can someone with experience in share registration please shed some light before I get on the phone with Computershare because I had asked them this question specifically before making registering them.\n\nAppreciate any help.",
