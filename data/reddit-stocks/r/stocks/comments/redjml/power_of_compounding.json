There was one more thing that I forgot to emphasize in that post - The power of compounding.\n\nYoung investors, you have an opportunity of a lifetime, literally a retirement lottery ticket if you are in your early twenties and start investing a regular amount every single month. I will take a very realistic example of how much you can make by investing early. And, the best part is you don't even have to be good at analyzing companies and pick Individual stocks.\n\nLet us say you start with a sum of $2400 at the age of 20 to start Investing in broad market based ETF like QQQ or SPY. And you put just $200 every month ($2400 a year) till you reach retirement. You would be looking at a sum of $2 million dollars at the age of 65 considering average market return of 10% per year.\n\nWanna hear even a more crazier story. Let's assume you are lucky to end up in a high paying job in Tech or Finance early in your career that pays 80-90K or above and you are able to save and invest $12,000 a year  ($1000 a month) in the same scenario. Starting with $12,000 at the age of 20, and adding $12,000 every year to your Investment account, you will end up with a whopping $10 million dollars at the age of 65.\n\nCompounding is absolutely an amazing thing that is often overlooked when you start investing. Investing regularly almost like a second habit will ensure that you will have always have enough money for major life events. Increasing your monthly investment amount regularly as you grow and progress in your career will lead to even larger amounts than mentioned in above scenarios.",
