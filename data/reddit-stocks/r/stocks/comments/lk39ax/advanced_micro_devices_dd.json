They will keep growing while Intel is stagnating for a least 2 years waiting on 7 nm processors. Nvidia is a monster and I hope the EU crushes their ARM deal. AMD is in a really good place to dominate the Desktop CPU sector, gain significant market share in laptops and servers, and take points off of Nvidia in GPU’s. AMD to $120 I think *shrug</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hey everyone! I’m just a college student who got bored and wanted to find the fastest way to through away my loans. GME afforded me that opportunity, so now I’m going to try my hand at making money. Or at least analysis. I’ve been following AMD since they released Ryzen Gen 2. Intel had been sitting comfortable in the throne, barely improving chips (how long did they use 10 nm nodes lol?) each generation and hoarding cash because they didn’t have a competitor. Ryzen 2 changed that, Ryzen 3 made AMD the market leader, and I believe Ryzen 4 will solidify it. The difference is even though AMD is at the top, they haven’t slowed down improving their product. Intel got complacent and now they’re paying for it. Pigs.</p>\n\n<p>Fundamentals:</p>\n\n<p>EPS: 20.7</p>\n\n<p>Market Capital: 113.6 Billion</p>\n\n<p>Profit Margin: 25.5%</p>\n\n<p>Operating Margin: 14.02%</p>\n\n<p>Revenue: 9.763 Billion</p>\n\n<p>Total Debt: 572 Million</p>\n\n<p>Free Cash Flow: 777 Million</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start off with the easy part. AMD is raking in money. Their margins are growing and their finally feeling comfortable. At the beginning of 2016 AMD&#39;s already meager revenue was down 20% to 4.3 Billion, Intel controlled 82% of the CPU market, and Nvidia controlled near 80% of the GPU market. Fast forward to 2021, their revenue for 2020 is 9.8 billion and AMD controls 50.8% of the CPU <a href=\"https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/revenue\">market</a>. Which is more than Intel if you can&#39;t do math. That&#39;s a remarkable turnaround, and I think the trend will continue. There&#39;s still nobody who wants their gpu&#39;s, but that&#39;s okay. CPU&#39;s are their forte, GPU&#39;s are just extra cash. For the most part I will compare AMD, INTC, and NVDA because those two are AMD’s biggest competitors. I’ll start with P/E, it goes Intel last w/ 12.5, AMD middle at 45.5, and Nvidia way ahead at 132. No one has been able to challenge Nvda for Market leader in something like two and a half decades, so this is not surprising. However, AMD’s revenue has increased 45% in the last year compared to Nvda’s going down nearly 7%. Intel’s margin is still slightly higher at 55% and AMD at 45, but AMD just began pricing at a higher cost than Intel, so I expect that to change. There is a large discrepancy in the P/B ratio: INTC at 2.36%, NVDA at 12.56% and coming in at the top, AMD at 19.05%. However, we are in a historic bull run, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00n6xPgB2VSYgvh3QW6B6IjOz0sUQ:1613338536956&amp;q=Jerome+Powell&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3yIo3LjK1fMRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uJC08Sxi5fVKLcrPTVUIyC9PzckBAK_YEhRWAAAA\">Jerome Powell</a> said don’t worry about the interest rates, so I won&#39;t. Every stock looks overvalued, yet they keep going up, so I think AMD is still undervalued relatively. They beat earning predictions by 10% last quarter, and projected that they grow by 37% vs the consensus of 27% this year. AMD has a measly 113 Billion market cap contrasted to 250 billion for Intel and 370 billion for Nvidia. Yet AMD is still taking market share away in both the CPU and GPU sector. Every time I’ve bet against Elon Musk or Lisa Su I’ve lost, so now I’ll ride her coattail to $110. The stock has been flirting with the all-time high for the last week, and I think it’ll jump to $110ish, retreat back to high 90’s, then climb back to $120 where it will settle. Let&#39;s go over the good and bad. In 2016</p>\n\n<p>We all know about the supply issues. It&#39;s a widespread issue and no one knows really when it will end. One good sign is Biden committed to signing an executive order to conduct a supply chain review and develop a long-term strategy to avoid future shortages. I’m not sure if it will have any tangible short-term effects on either the stock price, or the supply but I do believe it will increase investor confidence. If the government backs it, it literally can’t go tits up. (To be clear, the government is backing the semiconductor supply chain, not AMD. They could go tits up, but I really doubt it.) Another good sign was at the CES keynote, Lisa Su said they’re expecting “tightness in the first half of the year,” meaning supply will be back to normal in the second half of the year? But take this with a grain of salt because back in early 2020, she said supply would be back to normal by Q4 2020. It’s entirely possible supply will return since covid is receding everywhere except the US. There’s a lot of money on the table right now for whoever can get hardware out. She also said they’re investing in new facilities to avoid this problem so hopefully between the new factories and government intervention their supply chain will be future proof for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure where what paragraph to talk about this under, so it’s getting its own. Up until their exemption expired two months ago, AMD was paying 7% tariff rates on certain good from China that most other people had to pay 25%. Biden didn’t extend the discount and he hasn’t committed to repealing or leaving the taxes in place. This will impact their margins significantly.</p>\n\n<p>I think the supply issues are overplayed. Obviously it’s a large issue, but it’s not entirely because the supply has gone dry. There was a perfect storm in 2020 between COVID, the PS5, Xbox, AMD/Nvidia GPU’s, Intel/AMD CPU’s, automobile manufacturers, and the tech industry booming. Covid added on to that. Covid simultaneously caused a significant boom in demand for electronics and disrupted supply.</p>\n\n<p>The Semiconductor Industry Association said sales for semiconductors would rise 8.4 percent in 2021, which is 164% the growth rate in 2020 (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html\">source</a>). A notable jump when there were 433 billion semiconductors sold in 2020. I’ll do the math for you. That’s 710 billion semiconductors being sold during a ‘supply shortage’ this year. Imagine how many would have been sold if supply kept up with demand. Every device has multiple chips. Chips to control the display, manage power, operate connections, or pick up location. And demand is only going to skyrocket as more electronics/sensors are put into more things. On top of that, short supply is a better problem to have than exorbitant excess of quickly depreciating assets. Trying to guess how much of a product you need is tricky, then when companies realized there weren’t going to be enough semiconductors to go around they all tried to get theirs, and in turn increased the discrepancy between supply and demand. The last cause I felt worthwhile to put in here is the tariff war Trump had with China. Trump bared the biggest foundry in China from getting advanced chip manufacturing gear and barred US companies from dealing with them. This also decreased the supply of semiconductors substantially. China still may have an impact though, they announced that semiconductors will make up a substantial portion of its “Made in China 2025” plan. They are currently aiming to produce 70% of the conductors used in China, the majority through SMIC, and have backed their statements up with billions of dollars. However, they’re still far behind private companies though and SMIC has been successfully sued for intellectual property theft on two separate occasions, the first for $135 million, the second for 200 million, 8% of shares to TSMC with the option to obtain around 10% should they think about stealing again. So, I wouldn’t count on this. Should SMIC find a way to make 7nm chips while it’s still the standard, and get around US restrictions, they could provide relief to a thin supply chain right now and make a lot of money. I don’t think it’s likely it’ll happen soon enough to take advantage of the shortage, but I’ve learned to never count China out when it comes to making money. I’ll keep it here because of the possible impact given they figure it out.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s move on to AMD’s near Future. They just released new chips and GPUs in the second half on 2020, so I wouldn’t expect any largely impactful releases soon. I expect them to finish out their product line with midrange GPU’s/CPU’s. Meh, whatever. What I’m excited about is Zen 4.It was scheduled to release late 2021, and in December 2020 they said they were still on schedule, then early this year it changed to sometime in 2022. I expect it to be early 2022 based on leadership sticking to the late 2021 timeline up until Dec 2020, but this is pure speculation. Leaks have Zen 4 forty percent faster than Zen 3. It’ll probably be closer to twenty-five percent, but I’m welcome to AMD surprising me. Even at twenty-five percent, Zen 4 will once again outclass anything Intel is putting out. Also, this will be the first release where AMD is already established as the market leader. Zen 2 let everyone know they were back, Zen 3 showed that it wasn’t a fluke, Zen 4 should cement that and farther sway market share. It’s being built on a 5 nm process node, something Intel hasn’t dreamed of yet. Intel will be outclassed for at least 2 years, likely closer to 5. They haven’t had to compete in so long they forgot what it was like. <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/amd-5nm-next-generation-zen-4-ryzen-epyc-cpus-to-feature-over-25-ipc-increase/\">Here</a> is a more detailed map of AMD’s releases in the next two ish years. A lot is unknown about Zen 4 now, but hopefully I’ll make enough money from AMD to get one and I’ll let y’all know how it is. They’ve also bought Xilinx for $35 Billion. Xilinx is a market leader in chips with logic gates. They are entirely different from chips we are familiar with today. They can be altered after leaving the factory. People can use this to specialize their CPU for a task. This show where AMD thinks the future of processors is and by having the market leader in that sector, AMD is already ahead. Not much has been said outside of there being a merger.</p>\n\n<p>AMD has some stiff competition. I’ll focus on the CPU market then move to GPU’s, then smaller markets. There has been a shift toward ARM based processors recently: Apple M1, Qualcomm chips, Microsoft building one currently, and AMD had it in their plans but nothing else has been mentioned. They gave a window from 2017 – 2022, so It didn’t seem that important to them. I don’t see this affecting them or forcing them to switch over. Lisa Su was asked about it and she believes the x86 is still the future, so I’ll take her word for it. Who is Apple anyways? Anyways, arm powers the vast majority of mobile devices and high-powered embedded systems. Arm makes money selling the license to design chips based on their intellectual property. They have tech giants like Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Nvidia all paying for the right, it’s undisclosed how much they are paying though. Maybe if we all pool our money we’ll have enough to partake in the fun. While not too important to AMD currently, it could be in the future. Nvidia announced they were buying ARM late 2020. If they succeed it will allow them not pay licensing fees anymore! In addition, they’re flirting with anti-competitive laws, aka a monopoly. All the companies currently leasing the ARM architecture are under strict guidelines restricting how much can be changes, and thereby restricting innovation. This hasn’t been a problem because everyone one had the sameish rules. Nvidia owning arm would give them control over those restrictions and handicap all other competitors. Should they desire to get into the smartphone market, they could innovate freely while restricting or just outright block others access to arm. Objections have been made based on anti-competitiveness by Qualcomm and Microsoft (lol). The deal is also being investigated by the UK, EU, and probably others. The US congress is on a well-deserved vacation for a while after doing nothing for the past 4 years so we’re sitting this one out it seems. Nvidia owning arm could have some scary repercussions. Since we’re focusing on AMD, if the deal goes through just assume AMD will have 0% market share in the mobile industry. Here’s some quick Nvidia DD, if deal = success: Buy.</p>\n\n<p>On to Intel. According to <a href=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/88507-intel-grabs-cpu-market-share-back-amd-first.html\">techspot</a>, AMD’s x86 market share fell from 20.1% to 19.3% even though the X86 market grew 20.1%. I attributed this to lack of supply. To back this up, consider Intel sales jumped the day after AMD said shortage will last at least several months.(10 minutes, maybe more!) I think people were waiting for AMD to resupply, then when they found out there wouldn’t be stock for a few months, they bought Intel. As a whole AMD’s market share declined .7% in Q4 but was up 6.2% for 2020. Now let&#39;s walk through what Intel’s up to. They got a new CEO finally. It was going to be another sears if that didn’t happen. Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO, seems pretty solid. I’m seeing comparisons to Steve Jobs returning to Apple. Pat didn’t start Intel, it’s not his child, so I don’t see how that works. But he could reinvigorate some life. He began as an Intel quality-control tech when he was 18. He got his bachelors from Santa Clara, then his masters from Stanford, all while moving up the ranks at Intel. Not bad. He ended up working at Intel for 30 years, which happens to be how long Intel will be using 10nm processors. Also he was the first ever Chief of Technology Officer for Intel from 2000-2005. I’m not sure what that is and I don’t have the energy to look, but most positions with a C in front are important, or at least well paid. He was the CEO for VMware up until a few days ago, and they seem to being doing well, current stock price of $145, no massive amounts of debt or anything. Nothing wild, stable growth. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/patgelsinger?challengeId=AQEEh2JtIcpqrgAAAXei0TxLObNVwusIH5OQIEz5fQ0IhjxFtNNGjXVQUjKWuSrCf6Ys6H8bh0Apq1z-FXymHtqn4g3dC1A4Xg&amp;submissionId=611eae20-25c0-6316-847c-037cbaa1386a\">Here</a> is his LinkedIn if you want to check it out. He takes over Intel on the 15th of February (the day after I’m writing this). The stock went up 11% after the announcement came out, giving a necessary break from the constant stream of bad news out of Intel recently. Pat Gelsinger hasn’t said anything of his plans for Intel outside of “make better products” 4head. I’ve read a few articles that claimed he would pretty much stick to Intel status quo, but I disagree. What’s interesting is he has been offered high positions by Intel between when he left and when he comes back tomorrow but he supposedly he turned them down because he couldn’t change things. Which goes directly against sticking to the status quo. Even still, he’s not God and he can’t make 7nm chips out of bread and water so while he might be the catalyst in an upward trend for Intel on the long long haul, they aren’t doing well now.</p>\n\n<p>Intel plans to release their 11th-generation Rocket Lake Processors as early as mid-March (unconfirmed by Intel, subject to change). This seems positive as AMD can’t supply enough processors so ideally Intel fills this gap. Unfortunately, the chips still suck. Benchmarks have been leaked, <a href=\"https://premiumbuilds.com/comparisons/intel-i9-11900k-vs-i9-10900k-vs-ryzen-9-5900x/\">here</a> is a “good” comparison to AMD. I’ll summarize for those that don’t want to read. Do your own research people, I could spout some bs right now and you wouldn’t know any better. Anyways, Intel’s best 11th gen is about 20% better than their best 10th gen if the benchmarks are to be trusted. I expect they’re cherry picking which specific CPU they’re benching and giving it every possible advantage. A lot of the system info given on the benchmark is blurred out. I suspect they blurred everything other than the speed, socket, and chip to hide that they blew their budget on their cpu and couldn’t afford a good gpu. Ta da, both me and Intel are using a 1070. (: If you scroll a little bit on the link above you’ll see a “good” comparison to AMD’s last gen chips, I’ve been writing for around five hours and can’t be bothered to summarize, to I’ll just quote it.</p>\n\n<p>Even when it comes to competing with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900X, which is priced in the range of the i9-10900K, the i9-11900K is about 9% faster in single core speeds. Of course, the i9-11900K will severely lack in multi core speeds, as it is missing four cores and eight threads. Also, if the leaked clock speeds are to be trusted, the i9-11900K will have a significantly faster boost clock speed, reaching 5.3 GHz, versus the 4.8 GHz of the Ryzen 9 5900X. But if we are to compare the i9-11900K with a Ryzen CPU that has an equivalent number of cores and threads – which in this case is the Ryzen 7 5800X – we see that it has a 12% faster single-core speeds, and just about the same multi-core scores.”</p>\n\n<p>I put quotations around good because this is bad. Intel’s next gen chips should not be competing with AMD’s last gen chips. To give an easier frame of reference, here’s an example of how next gen chips should measure up at minimum. I compared last gen i9-9900K (Intel&#39;s Best 9th gen chip released Oct 2018) vs Ryzen 7 1800X (AMD’s best 1’st gen Ryzen released March 2017) *I’m ignoring the Threadripper line because they are targeted at a different, smaller audience. <a href=\"https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Ryzen-7-1800X-vs-Intel-i9-9900K/2966vs3334\">Results</a>. As you can see, the i9 beats the 1800x in every category except thread/core count because Intel refuses to move into the future. And this is pretty much Intel’s best processer they will be releasing until 2023. Pat has stated that Intel is figuring out how to make 7nm chips much quicker now but what is he supposed to say? “I don’t know how tf Bob Swan managed to lose this much market share in 2 years when Intel was so far ahead of AMD.” No, he needs to say something that inspires confidence in new leadership. When Bob Swan was Ceo 7nm chips were pushed back until 2023, and I’m not sure Pat has the power to advance a timeline that quickly. They’re taking a backseat until they cough up 7nm processors or tap a different market. To show how confident AMD is in their position, they priced chips above their intel counterpart after making Intel slash prices one-two years ago. They have the superior product and finally have the recognition to act like it. Intel has been relegated to the budge chip for a few years minimum. Because if you think Zen 4 won’t blow whatever Intel is about to release, you’re wrong. Intel will also be releasing Alder Lake in the 4th quarter of 2021. I couldn’t find any leaks or information about it but I assume it’ll be 10nm just like the rest of their chips. For those that don’t know, the smaller you can make the processor the faster clock speeds you’ll get, manufacturing cost go down, and quality improves. A quick example is: Say you have a wafer with 3 defects on it, but you can fit 100 processors on it, because they’re so small. You have 97 usable processors from this single wafer. While if you were Intel you could only fit one processor per wafer, and it’s unusable because there’s 3 defects on your processor. Exaggerated, but gets the point across I think.</p>\n\n<p>One thing Intel has going for them is brand recognition. They were the market leader for more than a decade and did well to establish that. AMD was a great value brand. It will take a while for that sentiment to change, especially with those that don’t keep up with tech.</p>\n\n<p>Last paragraph about Intel. I promise. Last fall Pat said if their factories can’t reliably deliver on processors, he’d consider outsourcing. The only suppliers realistically big enough for this are TSM or Samsung. TSM already makes chips for self-driving cars on behalf of Intel, so advantage TSM. I suspect circumstances have changed though because Pat Gelsinger stated during an earning call on 1/21/2021 that he was “confident the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally.” Given that they haven&#39;t started outsourcing, it’s possible. If they do outsource it was result in the loss of at least 30,000 jobs. I don’t know if they care about that though. Extra DD again, if the deal goes through, buy whoever gets it. Maybe buy TSM anyways. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-may-outsource-production-of-some-top-chips-to-samsung-tsmc-report\">reported</a> that Intel was in discussions w/ both companies to outsource products starting 2023. (I don’t&#39; have a Bloomberg subscription, so I’m taking crn’s word for it.) Additionally, Intel was awarded a huge defense contract by the US government. Whoever managed that should get a raise. They’ve also entered a three-year collaboration with Sandia National Labs to fight nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Not sure if that’ll make them money or what.</p>\n\n<p>The server market represents a lot of potential for AMD. Intel dominates the market with like 90% market share, but amd’s share increased from 5% to 8% in 2019 and is double digits in midway through 2020. This is the most recent accurate data I could <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/16/amd-is-about-to-double-down-on-a-huge-opportunity/\">find</a>. Their current market share doesn’t matter anyways. It’s not about where they’re at right now, it’s about where Lisa Su is going to take them. AMD showcased their 3rd gen server processors named “Milan” by pitching them in a weather prediction simulation against Intel’s Xeon Gold 6258R. The Milan was 68% faster in single-socket performance and 46% faster in dual socket. Now, I know, I know. “Wtf you just bitched about Intel comparing their top-of-the-line next gen cpu with old hardware. Yes I did. I think this is different because AMD blew them out of the water. The presentation was given by AMD, so everything was hand-picked in their favor, but it’s still impressive. If you’re skeptical about it, good. Wait until Intel releases their server chip and see how the two compare. But guess what. The Milan is based on a 7 nm node. It was pitted against a 14 nm node, and Intel’s new server cpu will be ….......10 nm. Morons. If they can take away a significant portion of the server, Intel could start to lose their hold as the staple processor. Who knows what will happen then? Rain upwards? Walk on your hands? Me passing CS? Doubt it.</p>\n\n<p>We can run though laptops quickly. AMD is releasing their 4000 series sometime this year, hopefully it’ll be good. Intel is still entrenched in this market and they have a lot of support from people like Dell and HP who keep putting overpriced underperforming Intel chips in their best computers and limiting AMD processors w/ weaker hardware. But again, AMD market share here went up 10%, so we might be seeing the shift happen. I looked up the best laptops to buy because that what I imagine people who don’t understand tech do. The top 3 on nearly all websites are Mac’s or Intel driven. I think that just shows mainstream sentiment hasn’t changed much. Or maybe I was looking up all my Intel data before then, so then they recommended all Intel. The mobile market followed a similar trend, just imagine everywhere I put laptops it says mobile.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the graphics card market. Their 10-K doesn’t say a lot about it or what they plan to do. Just that they are competing with Nvidia, Intel is developing their own high-end gpus. Of topic, but both Nvidia and Intel are trying to break into each other&#39;s respective markets. Nothing serious has come out about Intel’s GPU’s so I can’t tell you much about that. Nvidia is the market leader, there is no question in this market. AMD was in the same position vs Intel five years ago, so it’s possible, but hard. Intel slowed down innovating, Nvidia has not. AMD cards also have a bad reputation of being buggy and having bad drivers. Nvidia has a nice program in Gforce and GSync. I don’t see AMD leading this market unless Nvidia hands it to them. However, they have a few things going for them. Competition is good for the industry and I think people realize that after Intel didn&#39;t innovate until they were forced to. There&#39;s also a large entry barrier, so it&#39;s unlikely they&#39;ll have to compete with anyone outside of Nvidia and Intel. And I&#39;d give Intel at least a few generations to work out the kinks. It ends up being Nvidia vs AMD for a few years minimum and I believe AMD will take some market share. Not lead, but hold their own.</p>\n\n<p>Consoles were a big win for AMD in 2020. They won contracts to provide chips for both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Sales between the two equate to 9-10 billion dollars. However, both console sales have been trending down while Switch sales have been trending up for the past three <a href=\"https://www.vgchartz.com/article/442352/switch-vs-ps4-vs-xbox-one-global-lifetime-salesjanuary-2020/\">years</a>. Particularly the Xbox. I’ve the argument that as consoles catch up to PC performance they will take market share <a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/290387-report-20-million-pc-gamers-could-switch-to-consoles-by-2022\">away</a>. I don’t agree with this analysis but I put it in here so you can choose for yourself. My reasoning is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Cross play is becoming common, don’t have to get a console to play w/ console friends,</li>\n<li>PC has a higher entry barrier usually, but last longer, and can upgrade one or two things at a time for a few hundred dollars instead of getting an entire new system</li>\n<li>Not that many must-have exclusives anymore (Microsoft punching the air right now)</li>\n<li>I’m not sure how the Switch fits in, Nintendo is always a wild card to me. Also, the KFC console hasn’t set a release date, but if it does drop I can see the market shifting on its head and going 100% toward KFC. It will be powered by Intel. I’m not actually sure I would want my brand associated with KFC, but Intel didn’t ask me for some reason. That sounds like something a 60 year old guy names Bob Swan would do.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I think AMD will be the market leader in CPU’s for at least 8 years. I think their stock will keep bouncing for a while until the supply squeeze goes away, then earning will come out, Intel will be broke, and AMD will laugh all the way to the bank. There are a few big ifs, the supply chain being fixed, the ARM deal, and figuring out what Intel&#39;s new CEO is up to.</p>\n\n<p>if you read all this way I’m impressed. You are very dedicated and I appreciate you because I don’t have anyone else to share all my research with. My roommates eyes glaze over after 30 seconds. It might not flow very well because it was all bullet points before hand. I&#39;ve put all the sources I could find again in here. I&#39;d love to hear anything I didn&#39;t bring up, or contest my points. It&#39;s all imaginary money anyways.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Idk anything dude, I’m a 21-year-old college student making educated guesses off what I read. My current position in AMD is 5@$59 because I sold half to buy gme @$350 :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
