  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink)</h1>\n\n<p>Second time posting DD ($ON was my first <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh6ppx/on_on_semiconductor_analysis/\">here</a>)- please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments. There was a lot more research that went into this one as some of the kind commenters identified gaps in my research methodology last time so I have tried to make up for it here.</p>\n\n<p>All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified.</p>\n\n<h3>TL; DR</h3>\n\n<p>Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.\nLumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.</p></li>\n<li><p>Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with</p></li>\n<li><p>Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. </p></li>\n<li><p>Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.</p></li>\n<li><p>LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).</p></li>\n<li><p>Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Data</h3>\n\n<p>All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price = $13.45</li>\n<li>P/E = -12x</li>\n<li>EPS = -2.12 (dil)</li>\n<li>Forward P/E = 8.5x</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Detailed Analysis</h1>\n\n<h3>Bull Considerations</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>$LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.</p></li>\n<li><p>$LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).</p></li>\n<li><p>Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes<sup>1</sup> and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).</p></li>\n<li><p>The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of &gt; 9%).</p></li>\n<li><p>Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.</p></li>\n<li><p>Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bear Considerations</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.</p></li>\n<li><p>$LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.</p></li>\n<li><p>$LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)</p></li>\n<li><p>$LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.</p></li>\n<li><p>Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.</p></li>\n<li><p>Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.</p></li>\n<li><p>Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Neutral Considerations</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.</p></li>\n<li><p>Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.</p></li>\n<li><p>Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date<sup>2</sup>. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (&lt; 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement<sup>3</sup>. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.</p></li>\n<li><p>$LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Organisation Summary</h3>\n\n<p>Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025<sup>4</sup>.</li>\n<li>Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth<sup>5</sup>.</li>\n<li>Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026<sup>6</sup>.</li>\n<li>Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025<sup>7</sup>. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.</li>\n<li>Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027<sup>8</sup>. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres<sup>9</sup>.</li>\n<li>Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.</li>\n<li>Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027<sup>10</sup>. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022<sup>11</sup>.</li>\n<li>The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026<sup>12</sup>.</li>\n<li>The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025<sup>13</sup>. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025<sup>14</sup>. However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%<sup>15</sup>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%<sup>16</sup>.</li>\n<li>Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually<sup>17</sup>.</li>\n<li>Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021<sup>18</sup>). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR<sup>19</sup>.</li>\n<li>Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025<sup>20</sup>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Competitive Advantage</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Adaptive Networking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.</li>\n<li>From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&amp;T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either<sup>21, 22</sup>. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.</li>\n<li>$LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route<sup>23</sup>.</li>\n<li>The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.</li>\n<li>While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&amp;T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Collaboration:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.</li>\n<li>While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.</li>\n<li>Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Connected Security:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.</li>\n<li>If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.</li>\n<li>Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Edge Computing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.</li>\n<li>As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with &lt;5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).</li>\n<li>An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.</li>\n<li>While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Hybrid Cloud: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.</li>\n<li>Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively<sup>24</sup>.</li>\n<li>If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Resources Used</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-completes-redemption-level-3-211500651.html\">$LUMN bond redemption</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2020/12/11/mason-hawkins-southeastern-strengthens-connection-with-lumen-technologies/?sh=24a83d3e748a\">Southeastern Asset Management $LUMN investment</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://southeasternasset.com/commentary/4q20-llpf-commentary/\">Southeastern Asset Management Lumen Summary (Page 11)</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/26/2164048/0/en/The-Content-Delivery-Network-CDN-market-size-is-projected-to-grow-from-USD-14-4-billion-in-2020-to-USD-27-9-billion-in-2025-at-a-Compound-Annual-Growth-Rate-CAGR-of-14-1.html\">CDN Market Growth</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.ftthcouncil.eu/documents/FTTH%20Council%20Europe%20-%20Panorama%20at%20September%202019%20-%20Webinar%20Version4.pdf?_cldee=c2VyZ2Vqcy5taWthZWxqYW5zQGZ0dGhjb3VuY2lsLmV1&amp;recipientid=contact-d5d9f6a4bf62ea11a811000d3ab8d09b-775e8e4edf744432a5a5f2945cc75e33&amp;esid=7201b2af-e412-eb11-a813-000d3adb37c7\">Fiber European Coverage</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/network-as-a-service-market-growth-trends-and-forecasts\">Network as a Service Growth</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip-market\">VOIP Market</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/880975/global-contact-center-market-size/\">Call Centre Market Growth</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/call-centre-market\">Call Centre Market Changes</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/team-collaboration-software-market\">Collaboration Solution Market</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/web-application-firewall-market-176479811.html\">WAF Market Growth</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/ddos-protection-market\">DDoS Mitigation Market Growth</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/managed-security-services-market-5918403.html\">Managed Firewall Market</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146204/0/en/Edge-Computing-Market-Growth-Trends-Forecasts-2020-2025.html\">Edge Computing Market Growth</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://stlpartners.com/edge-computing/edge-computing-market-trends/\">Edge Computing Market Trends</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/half-yearly-review-shows-150-billion-spent-cloud-services-and-infrastructure\">Cloud Market Trends</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/web-hosting-services-market\">Web Hosting Services Trend Analysis</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-07-gartner-says-worldwide-data-center-infrastructure-spending-to-grow-6-percent-in-2021\">Data Centre Spending Growth</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.vxchnge.com/blog/2020-colocation-trends-wrap-up\">Colocation Market Trends</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/16/2109759/0/en/Global-Cloud-Storage-Market-2020-to-2025-Rise-of-Containerization-Presents-Opportunities.html\">Cloud Storage Trends</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/provider-detail?version=dec2019&amp;direction=d&amp;hoconums=130228,130077,131425\">Network coverage CenturyLink, Verizon and AT&amp;T</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.lumen.com/en-uk/resources/network-maps.html\">Fiber, edge location and datacentre coverage</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network#List_of_Tier_1_networks\">$LUMN Fiber Route Length</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/cloud-adoption-statistics/#gref\">Cloud Adoption Statistics</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n\n<p>This post is an expression of opinion and not intended as guidance or advice.
