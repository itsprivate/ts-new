I’m here to tell you why. </p>\n\n<p>This is a healthcare REIT, I work in healthcare but am not associated with this type of care. </p>\n\n<p>~75% of their portfolio is involved with skilled nursing facilities. The rest is mostly senior housing. With the aging population this is a great play. They currently own 238 properties in the US. </p>\n\n<p>FFO growth CAGR: 1 yr 3.1%, 3 yr 16.1%, 5 yr 21.2%. This reflects good income growth over the long term. </p>\n\n<p>FFO/Share CAGR: 1 yr 1.5%, 3 yr 4.5%, 5 yr 5.9%.  Both of these growth rates are ahead of their peers and indicate the company has good growth towards the future. This is to be expected with the aging population; more people become old and need more help = more customers. </p>\n\n<p>Price/ffo is a little high compared to the average: 17.67x vs 5 yr avg 14.84x. </p>\n\n<p>Debt/asset is safe: 36.3%\nDebt/ebitda: 3.4x\nMaturity of debt is in 3-5 years so they have time to grow more with what they have. </p>\n\n<p>Dividend of 1$/yr. \ndividend growth: 1 yr 11.1%, 3 yr 10.6%, 5 yr 10.1%. \nDividend growth is steady and occurs y/y. \nPayout ratio is 72.5% which is good in REITs. </p>\n\n<p>Overall this is one of my higher convictions and I add every month to it. I believe in it more than most equities out there. They have a strong leadership group and are growing at a good rate without taking on too much debt. This is a stock you buy and retire with. Cheers. </p>\n\n<p>I got my info from alreits.com. Thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
