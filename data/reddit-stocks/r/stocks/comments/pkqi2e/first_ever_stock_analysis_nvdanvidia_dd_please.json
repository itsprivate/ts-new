As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, let’s use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the company’s average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So let’s break it down\n\nEV stands for “Enterprise Value”. Enterprise value is made up of the company’s equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the company’s value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the company’s shares.\n\nSo we have nvidia’s equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billions) so we have the EV: 549.69B (information gathered by Merrill Lynch) \n\nNow that we have the EV, what is EBITDA? EBITDA or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization is simply putted as the measure of profitability. Like EV, its just a way of understanding a business’s profitability better than net income can. Debt to Equity ratio, Free Cash Flow Yield, P/E Ratio are also helpful, but we aren’t going there. \n\nFormula: So we’ll take the Net Income of Nvidia which is Earnings before Interest, then we’ll add interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Based off of a 10-k provided by the SEC, the Net Income: 4,332, Interest: 184, Taxes: 77, D and A: 1,098 \n\nEBITDA: 5.69B (in billions) \n\nSo we have the EV/EBITDA of 96.2 \n\nWhat do we do with this information? We can now compare it to the industry average. You’re looking for them to trade underneath the average. The Software and AI EV/EBITDA average is 106, so Nvidia is trading underneath the industry average. \n\n**Historical Price Target(s) + Business Fundamentals (Fundamental Analysis)**\n\nBefore Nvidia’s stock split (4:1) Nvidia was trading at a high of $750+. While considering we are in an eight year exponential tech bull run, I still think Nvidia was room to run back to close or even as high as its prior high. \n\nTesla stock was trading at around $2,213 before their split of 5:1. Then Tesla ran from $80 to almost $900 in a single year. Of course that was attributed to the bull run/short squeeze, but for Nvidia that could mean something. For Tesla to 10x in a year, isn’t hard for nvidia to 2x or even 3x from its current trading price based on their prior movements. Tesla’s 5 year gain in percentages is 1,838% while Nvidias 5 year gain is 1.401%. Their historical price movement is very similar so it wouldn’t be surprising is nvidia followed Tesla on a smaller, slower scale. \n\nBesides that, Nvidias business is huge for the retail consumption. Bitcoin miners and Gamers have been on a ramped uptrend for the past years and is ever growing. The main graphics card usage is for gamers and miners. So the disruption of graphics card and the demand will be huge for the foreseeable future. \n\n**#2: Technical Analysis** \n\nMany people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn’t as black and white, but that’s the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\nDaily Chart: \n\nSorry, chart is supposed to be here, but stocks doesn't allow.\n\nI can see Nvidia moving in two different ways within the next few weeks.\n\nOption A: We see nvidia break the flag and break above the all time high of $230 and make a new high\n\nOr Option B: We get rejected off the all time high or fail the break out and head down to the $206-207 support.\n\nBut Nvidia isn’t a short term play, Tesla took a year to 10x so this is definitely a 1-3 year play at least. \n\n**How I’m playing Nvidia**\n\nYes, I’m in nvidia. I wanted to make this so I can get criticism on my first Due Diligence and what I can fix or what I can add. I know this is super choppy and all over the place and I’m sure I missed more important things, but this is where I’m starting.\n\nI have 20% of my portfolio allocated to Nvidia. 12% in shares and 8% in long ATM calls dating in 2023. \n\nPrice Target: $300-$500+ depending on how fast the stock grows. \n\nPlease critique this as I only want to grow as an investor, but please keep the roasting to a minimum :D",
