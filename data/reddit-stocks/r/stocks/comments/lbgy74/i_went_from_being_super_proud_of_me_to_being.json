Not anywhere near people I see in WSB, but right now, I am down $1500. I know this is loose change for a lot of you and honestly, it&#39;s not an amount that&#39;s going to put me on the street or anything,  but it was my summer earnings that I saved for a trip to New York and cities around (I am from Canada). </p>\n\n<p>I am a business student, currently in University and investment finance always seemed very interesting and fascinating to me. So, since Canada banned non-essential travels between US/Canada borders, I was left with vacation money which was around 3000 USD. </p>\n\n<p>Instead of putting it in a savings account, I decided to finally start investing. I was using subs like <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a>, <a href=\"/r/personalfinance\">r/personalfinance</a>, <a href=\"/r/personalfinancecanada\">r/personalfinancecanada</a> for forums and was doing my own market research (the best somebody can do with little knowledge), learning, and was super excited to finally find a sector I wanted to invest in. Renewable Energy. I invested all of my $3000 in $PLUG, $FCELL and the rest in companies that are safe like $AAPL, $CIBC. It was fantastic. In just around 2 months, I made over 40% on my 3000$ capital and I was really proud of myself. I was motivated to do more research, learn more, and I felt good about myself (University grades were great, potential internships coming soon hopefully), it was just perfect. </p>\n\n<p>And then the GME, AMC thing started. So much contents, memes, to the moon post, that at one point, I completely lost my common sense, my rational part of the brain stopped working, I went from speaking like a normal person to... You know what I am talking about. My emoji recommendation changed to the rocket, diamonds, it&#39;s like I completely lost myself into a wild cocaine party full of booze and tequila marijuana smoothie with mushroom garnitures and I drank them all and decided to become a R... (As they say).</p>\n\n<p>My senses came back today morning once I finally noticed what I had actually done, and realized how much I went against all the single concepts and fundamentals I used to start trading. </p>\n\n<p>I am still holding, because well, market&#39;s closed but I seriously don&#39;t know what to do. Good companies go back up. Gamestop has nothing backing itself up except rumours of a potential short saueeze and faith of millions who went all in. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not the $3000 (net) that&#39;s bothering me, it&#39;s just that, I started out like a normal person who was doing amazing and got turned into a cult member. I am not hating into anybody of WSB, I don&#39;t even blame them. I blame my own judgement. I learnt my lesson but then again, it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t know what I was getting into. It was mostly stupidity and greed I think. </p>\n\n<p>Any advice, any suggestion, any smack in the head, reality check would be appreciated. Sorry for the rant. This is the only sane community that deals with stocks currently.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
