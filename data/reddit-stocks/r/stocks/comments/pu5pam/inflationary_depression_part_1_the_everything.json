  "selftext": "The US is showing signs of Inflationary Depressions from the past. I have created a 3 part series that will break it down. Part 1 will break down the current market and how we got here. Part 2 will explain what we should expect and why we are beginning to see the things we are seeing. Part 3 is how to profit off of the things learned in Parts 1 and 2.\n\n***So how did we get here?***\n\nIn March of the United States shut down the economic machine by forcing people into their homes to fend off what seemed at the time to be an extremely severe crisis. This immediately put the US into a store of pent-up demand. In order to hold off an economic collapse the Fed and the Federal government (we will look at them as two separate entities here) sent interest rates to zero, immediately initiated Quantitative Easing (the method the Fed uses to buy bonds as used in the ’08 crisis) while the government began dishing out trillions in stimulus (roughly 3.3 Trillion already paid out, 3.7 trillion obligated and another 1.2 Trillion budgeted).\n\nM2 Supply skyrocketed more than any other time in the past 60 years. From February 2008 to February 2020 M2 increased in historical fashion going from $7.5B to $15.4B which was an increase about in line for previous 12 year periods over the past 30 years (a roughly 6.2% annual increase). From February 2020 to July 2021 M2 has ballooned from $15.4B to $20.5B (a roughly 21% annual increase).\n\nOf course, with easy lending and plenty of cash we began to see debt grow extremely rapidly. Both nationally and among households. Household debt had moved past 2008 levels in Q1 of 2017 and has only been on an upward trajectory since. Although instead of moving into low interest rate housing loans, Americans are taking on more personal loans than ever before. But the US currently isn’t seeing the true burden of this debt as student loan debt payments (the 2nd highest form of debt and the highest form of personal debt) begin in February of next year. This pause on student debt was another inflationary pressure that will continue until the true debt burdens are taken on (roughly 60 billion in interest each year). We have also seen an increase in auto-loans the second highest personal loan type.\n\n***This wasn’t the beginning of our story***\n\nIn 2008 we had the biggest crash in arguably over 100 years as the whole financial institution had collapsed leading to at least 12 years of negative real interest rates with inflation out pacing the interest rate in all but one year.\n\nAs inflation takes off, we are seeing the lowest real interest rates we have seen since 1951. What has this led to? A ballooning of Assets and Debt to GDP (discussed more in the next section). With relaxed lending, QE continuing through 2015 from 2008, this has led to the wealth gap that we see today.\n\nCryptocurrency obviously has been affected by this, along with meme stocks, and stock prices in general. Corporate Debt has skyrocketed at insane levels across the world: China 150%+ of GDP, Japan 120%+ of GDP, America and Britain around 80% of GDP. Of course, this doesn’t bode well for the Chinese property market as I am sure from recent news you can guess where all of their Corporate debt is (Chinese Corporations are borrowing more than Japan’s bubble from the 80s/90s as a % of GDP). Property across the world is sky high.\n\n***What are the direct impacts of all this spending?***\n\nStocks have boomed over the last decade with Shiller’s P/E (a good sign of the valuation of the market) beginning to approach the levels of the ’99 bubble burst (it has already passed black Tuesday). This is due to the increased corporate debt and over stimulation from the Fed. Allowing for assets to skyrocket. Stocks have easily outpaced 15% over the past 5 years as well (S&P 500).\n\nNew comers are surging into the market en masse. A classic sign of a bubble (due to a majority of newcomers, not all, being relatively uninformed) with over 15% of current investors starting in 2020 (This was seen in the 1920s, 1990s, and mid 2000s). Also in an inflationary bubble good investments become harder to find as incomes rise and debt increases but more capital goes after these investments (stock bubble).\n\nInflation is a huge impact being felt by the increase in fiscal stimulus and easy lending. As debt has started to move up, we have seen real household income shrink in 2020 (and expect to see a much greater shrink in 2021) as inflation increases. Shortages have come to dominate our future with commodities skyrocketing in price with input good prices while demand has stayed solid due to a lack of action from the Fed. Housing has begun to feel the intense effects of shortages as well. We are only in the beginning stages and it is starting to be seen on 10-Q's. *SIDE NOTE: THE FED DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ASSET PRICES OR DEBT PRICES. THEY CARE ABOUT INFLATION, GDP GROWTH, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.* The US can begin to lose its reserve currency status if it allows for inflation to continue for too long as it puts downward pressure on the dollar.\n\nCompanies from Procter and Gamble, to FedEx, to Tesla are all being impacted by shortages in everything. Walmart even bought inventory in preparation of more shortages in Q4 of this year. Car prices are flying (although they’ve slowed). I think you get the picture. Because of the Feds incompetent ability to assess for large changes in assets and debt that get passed onto consumers they make the fatal flaw of relying too hard on CPI (Consumer Price Index). This has led to the Fed personally fueling these shortages along with other central banks (Historically almost all central banks abuse this flaw). I will discuss inflation and shortages more in a secondary post.\n\nWith Covid taking hold, the United States Government income plummeted but their spending skyrocketed. Already having a high Debt to GDP ratio, the ratio has stormed past any other point in United States history.\n\nAnd don’t worry the spending doesn’t seem like it will slow down anytime soon. Our one bright spot is that household debt to GDP has slowed down. In inflationary bubbles growth tends to be spurred by debt and in this case it seems to be the United States government debt. It’s not just the US with global debt to GDP raising to 365% of GDP. This leads to another sign of an inflationary bubble: GDP growth of over 4%, well above potential... The US just clocked 6.6% annual GDP growth. And although we don't have any data since 2019, I am sure foreign inflows are at all time highs.\n\nIn inflationary bubbles, you tend to see imports rise faster than exports causing the current account to worsen. This leads to a devaluation in the currency. The US happens to have the largest negative net export situation in over 70 years.\n\nI think it is safe to say that we are in the middle of an inflationary bubble. Now what?\n\n***So, what should we expect from here?***\n\nIn part 2 we will discuss the inflationary depression. Also in part 2 we will discuss the findings in this report and how it relates to what we should expect to see and what is currently being seen. This will discuss bubbles, shortages, inflation, and the impacts of too much fiscal stimulation. In part 3, we will discuss how to make money on the things we expect to see in part 2.",
