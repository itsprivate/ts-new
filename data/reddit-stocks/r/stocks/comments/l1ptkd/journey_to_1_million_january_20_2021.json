This one could be a very interesting buy if it forms a strong upwards trend. However, be careful. Don&#39;t assume because Ma is back online, means everything is ok. With Chinese New Year, China&#39;s biggest holiday, coming up, Alibaba has potential for huge profit. $BABA is up 5.5% today and will run up to $300 and more eventually. The biggest question is time. Alibaba is an ecommerce giant that is paramount in every single Chinese persons&#39; lives. On one hand, Ma has a big mouth; he shouldn&#39;t speak out against the CCP so tread with caution. On the other hand, there isn&#39;t much negative news in China against Alibaba currently. Sales on the ecommerce giant is business as usual.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price Target - <em>$300</em></li>\n<li>Entry - Buy <em>$270 and below</em></li>\n<li>Risk 1-5 - <em>2</em></li>\n<li>Timeframe - 2-4 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>$THCX</strong> - I will be buying at least 100 shares of this cannabis ETF and selling covered calls next week. Decriminalization is imminent and a vote is near. Legalization is a possibility in this administration although I don&#39;t think it would come anytime soon.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price Target - <em>$25</em></li>\n<li>Entry - Buy <em>$17 and below</em></li>\n<li>Risk 1-5 - 4</li>\n<li>Timeframe - 1-3 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>$PRNT</strong> - 3D Printing ETF managed by ARK Invest. This is gaining more popularity online, and anything ARK is and has been very, very successful. Personally, I want to hold this long term - for years. For now though, I&#39;ll be selling covered calls. This one is a little more expensive to acquire 100 shares - around $4000.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price Target - <em>$46</em></li>\n<li>Entry - Buy <em>$38 and below</em></li>\n<li>Risk 1-5 - 3</li>\n<li>Timeframe - 4-6 weeks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>$SURF</strong> - Surface Oncology is an ARK Invest baby that is clinical stage immuno-oncology company that is engaged in the development of cancer immunotherapies. ARK manager, Cathie Woods, has helped us make a lot of money so it is hard not to take a close look at this stock. Only $14, you can buy 100 shares for $1400 and start selling covered calls with me next week.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price Target - <em>$22</em></li>\n<li>Entry - Buy <em>$14 and below</em></li>\n<li>Risk 1-5 - 3.5</li>\n<li>Timeframe - 2-4 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Trading Charts and original Post:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prostockadvice.com/post/journey-to-1-million-january-20-2021\">https://www.prostockadvice.com/post/journey-to-1-million-january-20-2021</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
