For active members who have not yet received that $15 discount on their monthly bill, you will automatically receive a one-time credit on your next bill with no action needed. For members who were impacted and have initiated the cancellation process, we would love to welcome you back.\n\nDisney Statement \n&gt;\t“We are pleased to announce that after a brief disruption, we have reached a new distribution agreement with Google’s YouTube TV for continued carriage of our portfolio of networks.\n\n&gt;\tWe appreciate Google’s collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market, we’re thrilled that our robust lineup of live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming is in the process of being restored to YouTube TV subscribers.”\n\nhttps://thestreamable.com/news/disney-owned-channels-to-stay-on-youtube-tv",
