What’s ironic too is if I want to retire early, it also needs a lot of work lol so here’s my plan:\n\nSince I’m planning to retire early, I’ll have a shorter time to save and because of that, I’m going to need a lot of investment returns and have to grow my portfolio for long-term growth. And right now I’m gearing towards low-cost index funds. Also, I can't seem to locate any books that support \"growth\" investment in the way that it's done on Reddit. If you guys can help me out on this, it would be a great help.\n\nI’ll also be utilizing stocks apps. Right now I am using [TradeView](https://www.tradingview.com/), [Breaking Equity](https://www.breakingequity.com/), and [ComputerShare](http://www.computershare.com/us) mainly for mobile trading, streaming quotations, real-time balances, capital transfers, and current news and market research. Staying away from RobinHood now with the controversy going around it.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, I'll be maintaining around 6 months' worth of living costs in a HYSA. Some folks, especially with this COVID around, I’ve heard have gone as far as a year. I'll make sure my emergency savings are easily accessible and risk-free, which means they won't be in an investing account. Following that, I should be able to invest as much as I desire, based on my long-term aim (hopefully).\n\nRight now I maintain the majority of my money at [Vio bank](https://www.viobank.com/) and my sinking funds in Capital One. I know it won’t be easy and that life will get in the way sometimes but I will do my best to make the right decisions and do my DD/DYOR.\n\nSo far, what do you guys think? Does this appear to be a sound strategy?",
