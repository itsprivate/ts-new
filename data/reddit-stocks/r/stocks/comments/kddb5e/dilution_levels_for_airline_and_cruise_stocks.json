What this means is they needed money and issued more shares to raise money. <em>edit: this is not necessarily bad when the money is put to good use, but much of the money raised for the companies in this post was to simply pay expenses without any revenue coming in</em></p>\n\n<p>It may be a surprise then for new investors when they don&#39;t see their beaten down stocks return to the pre-covid price during and after the recovery. </p>\n\n<p>To help, here are popular recovery stocks, how many more shares have been issued, and the adjusted pre-covid price for these stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Prices are in USD and I used the <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/CCL/shares_outstanding\">YCharts site</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Carnival Cruise (CCL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1 price: 51.31</p>\n\n<p>Dilution: 60% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>31.25</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 58.83</p>\n\n<p>Dilution: 47% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>40.02</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Royal Caribbean (RCL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 134.65</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 7% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>125.84</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>American Airlines (AAL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 29.09</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 44% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>20.2</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Spirit Airlines (SAVE)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 40.65 </p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 42.6% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>28.5</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jet Blue (JBLU)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 18.89 </p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 15% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>16.43</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Delta (DAL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 59.04</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: They actually have less shares outstanding? I don&#39;t know a lot about the deals airline companies took or the debt they took either.</p>\n\n<p>Return price: 60?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Southwest (LUV)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 54.84</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 16% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>47.27</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>United (UAL)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jan 1: 89.74</p>\n\n<p>Share dilution: 18% more shares</p>\n\n<p>Return price: <strong>76.05</strong></p>\n\n<p>A note is that some of the airline stocks actually rose until mid-February. I wanted consistency between the stock price dates so I just did YTD. Also this does not account for new debt or sold planes/ships.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
