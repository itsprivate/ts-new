Tech seems to be down, however, does seems like it&#39;ll likely be a bit shaky in the near future, given interest rates, inflation, heavy market uncertainty, and actually when you zoom out on the 1-year graph, most of tech is still very high, compared to just under a year ago. The losses from many posts seem to just be from people buying at ATHs. </p>\n\n<p>On another note, non-tech stocks looks like they&#39;re more likely to go up in the near future, however have now already risen, and at all time highs, or near it. I&#39;m looking at Starbucks, JPM, DIS, TGT, but really works for most promising non-tech stocks.    </p>\n\n<p>Seems like we&#39;re basically choosing between decent, not necessarily good or bad, but just okay priced stocks that will probably be flat in the near future, and will become a long-hold, or stocks that may also be a great long-term hold, but at very ATH prices, that we should probably expect the major gains to be over, and will likely just to be buying to go up 10% end of year, unless there&#39;s something I&#39;m overlooking, of course &quot;well priced&quot; is also subjective, so figured I&#39;d ask and grab some opinions.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
