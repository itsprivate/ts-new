  "selftext": "Ebay has had no revenue growth over the past 10 years. But how has the stock performed over the past 10 years? It has actually performed slightly better than the S and P 500. How can a company that has about the same revenue from 10 years ago still compete with SPY during a bull market? The answer is the valuation of the stock through its earnings and cash flow. The PE ratio and Price to Free Cash Flow are both under 20 right now, just like they were 10 years ago. This has allowed the company to purchase back almost 50% of their shares during this time.   \n\nLooking to the future, Ebay is not going to grow at a fast pace, but literally any growth, even a few percent annualized would have great upside potential for the stock considering it was able to perform well with no growth over and 10 year period and still remain reasonably valued. While the 10 year revenue growth is roughly at 0, the past 5 year growth is at about 5%, and analysts are predicting modest revenue growth over at least the next 5 year period. \n\nI ran 3 models based on 0%, 2%, and 4% revenue growth per year over the next 7 years to determine what a fair value would be today for the stock to expect a 9 percent return per year. My assumptions included 8% buyback of shares per year, which is in between their 10 and 5 year average of 7-12 percent. I kept their FCF as % of Rev at the historic average of 24%. And I assumed a future PE in 7 years of 15 and a future P/FCF of 19. \n\nAt 0 percent revenue growth, I got a fair value of about $90-100. At 2 percent revenue growth I got a fair value of $100 to 110. And at 4 percent I got $115-120. Based on these numbers the stock is undervalued or at the very least near fair value if you want to be more conservative. \n\nAs a disclaimer, while my assumptions are based on conservative historic performance of the last 10 years and future analyst estimates, they could not materialize in the future. But I do think that the upside potential is much better than the downside potential.",
