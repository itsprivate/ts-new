This is despite new economic data that showed US GDP slowdown to its slowest expansion rate in over a year and new weekly unemployment claims.

Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest the ongoing corporate earning season.\n\nThe GDP report showed the economy decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity.

However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike. Cases in the US retreated from a high in the previous spike of 285,058 to 105,561 in between September 13 and October 25. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September. This came in higher than the 108.0 consensus economists were looking for, according to Bloomberg data.
