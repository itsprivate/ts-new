The amount of money the put is substantial. What struck me how many of them actually use leverage, as it is offered as well in such apps. It is gamified, it has a slider \"2x\" which can with a swipe increased to 5x. They have no clue what they are actually doing.\n\nAll-in-all they are extremely naive and not informed at all. I tried to educate, but then they show how much money they made on such accelerators. They don't look at P/E numbers of valuations, or risk. They jump onto stuff they hear in the news. The notion that the risk they take they have to compare, for example against the S&amp;P500 index tracker performance in the same time they are invested, is not present. (most of them have net green numbers)\n\nWithout exception all of them had the same motivation: their banks charge them negative rates on their cash (I live in europe), up to -0.5% they have to pay. With a currently inflation of 5% ish percent that means loosing 5.5% per year on their cash. But I guess in the rest of the world it is similar. On bonds/cash account you lose every year several % of your money. So everyone flocks into equity, without looking at the risks, \"as it ain't gonna get worse than my cash account bleeding\".\n\nEven an insurance agent tried to sell me an investment with a very high TER. No, the TER was not even known to her. Arguments didn't help, she was sure as hell, again the motivation was that cash was just losing value and that wouldn't change as Europe couldn't afford to raise the rates.\n\nAlso the \"large cap over small cap\" pattern I see. They buy Amazon, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, stuff they wear (Adidas, Nike), you name it. They stay away from the small stuff, because then they have to understand the business.\n\nAlso COVID did a lot. They were bored and saw advertisements everywhere... especially the banks themselves show every time on the login to their cash account their brokerage offer.\n\n[So I just looked up the use of margin.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL663067003Q)\n\nAs images tell more than a thousand words, but aren't allowed here, [here's a link.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=J6OZ) It basically dipped a bit in the march 2020 stock crash and then went up by a factor of 2.\n\nThis ain't good at all. So much leverage, with the FED preparing to raise rates.\n\nMy next step? Get more to a cash position. Green positions I partly exited (will hold some of them nevertheless) and will continue to do so. I want more dry powder if this powder keg goes up.\n\nYes, I know the \"time in the market\", market timing, etc etc. I will stay invested but I'm getting more to cash.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are you worried about the amount of naive retail game-like app investors, gambling with their money?\n\nDo you observe mania like behaviour? \n\nHow many friends and relatives are \"gaming\" using apps on the stock market?",
