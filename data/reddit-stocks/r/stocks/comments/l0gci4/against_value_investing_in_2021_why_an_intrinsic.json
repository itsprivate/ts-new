After the bear market hits, absolutely please revert back to value investing.</p>\n\n<p>Value investing is hard work – it requires the investor to evaluate the intrinsic value of a stock by careful analysis of the financial statements, researching company’s present and planned future state and looking out for any political factors. You could easily spend 1 week just researching one stock to convince yourself that you are ready to invest say $10,000 into that company.</p>\n\n<p>So it is understandable that most retail investors do not bother to do their due diligence before investing in a company. It ought be noted that sub 100 word posts on reddit with rocket emojis shilling another meme penny stock does not count as DD by any measure of the word diligence when you look it up on the dictionary – “careful and persistent work or effort”. </p>\n\n<p>If anything, doing your due diligence might harm your gains in this unprecedented bull market. A stock could go up 3 x times in that week it would take you to do your research and you would have missed the boat by then already.</p>\n\n<p>So, what determines the value of a stock to begin with? Intrinsic value plays a part, however ultimately it is the investment community BELIEF in what the stock is worth. It does not matter if the intrinsic value of a stock calculated after careful research is $10. IF the investor community at large believe and are willing to pay $100 for this stock, the value of the stock will climb to $100.</p>\n\n<p>An intelligent investor in 2021 should not waste their time doing their due diligence trying to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock, INSTEAD they should spend their time gauging the opinion of the general investor community to evaluate what they BELIEVE the stock could be worth.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following example. </p>\n\n<p>A value investor in Jan 2021 might ask themselves: should I invest in PLUG as a topical example. The company has never made a profit and is currently is in net debt. However due to their forward-looking technology, a reasonable investor might say a fair value is around $10 to $30.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile at the same time, a rookie investor browsing reddit in Jan 2021 might ask themselves, should I invest in PLUG? They do some research on reddit and find the company is already up at $60, however with the company still having significant meme potential and the sustainable energy / EV boom currently ongoing, the reddit investor might say: this bull run will run for a while so there is no reason to say PLUG won’t reach $100 by end of the year. By that logic, investing into PLUG at $60 is very reasonable and intelligent, you could make a near 2 x return in a short time frame.</p>\n\n<p>To sum up: being ignorant of the intrinsic value of a stock can be profitable just before the end of a bull run being propped up by artificial manipulation of interest rates by the federal reserve. If you want to make any serious profits in 2021, I’d suggest to give up any pre-conceived notions of value investing and ride the wave until it lasts instead of sitting on the side-lines.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
