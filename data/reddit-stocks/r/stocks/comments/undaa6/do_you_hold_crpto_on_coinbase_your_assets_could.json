Coinbase will take additional steps to ensure that it offers protection for its retail customers that match those offered to Prime and Custody consumers, Armstrong said in Twitter thread late Tuesday. “We should have updated our retail terms sooner, and we didn’t communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added,” Armstrong wrote. “My deepest apologies.”Shares in the company [fell 16%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-10/coinbase-plunges-after-first-quarter-revenue-misses-estimate) after regular trading as first-quarter revenue missed analyst estimates.\n\nSee CEO's Twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1524233480040710144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1524233480040710144%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2022-05-11%2Fcoinbase-ceo-says-no-risk-of-bankruptcy-amid-black-swan-event).\n\n&gt;This disclosure makes sense in that **these legal protections have not been tested in court for cr\\*pto assets specifically, and it is possible, however unlikely, that a court would decide to consider customer assets as part of the company in bankruptcy proceedings**...\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nI made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/udyyg5/what_is_going_on_with_coin/) last week about COIN asking for opinions because it was trading with a deep margin of safety based on DCF. The stock is down another 54% in the last 13 days since my post following an earnings miss on the top and bottom lines.\n\nI listened to the earnings call yesterday and thought management had a good strategy and plan for execution. However, this news is making me think of the CEO's response to a question from an investor about COIN's moat. Long story short, COIN doesn't really have a moat, but the CEO claims consumer \"trust\" in COIN is like a moat because it allows COIN to sell people who come to their platform to buy or trade cr\\*pto new services like NFTs, staking, DeFi, *etc.* They really made a big thing about how much their consumers trust them and how big a competitive advantage that is in a space like cr\\*pto where people coming into the market for the first time will generally get into the game through the most trusted name. I think this news — that your assets held by COIN, including their custody business, could be seized in the event of COIN's bankruptcy — should undermine customer trust in COIN. Failing to disclose such a significant risk in a timely manner is a huge red flag for me as a potential investor and attorney.\n\nIf there's enough interest from COIN bag-holders, I can do a preliminary legal analysis of the bankruptcy issues to assess the CEO's claim it is \"unlikely\" a court would allow the seizure of Coinbase's customers' cr\\*pto. The fact the claim is untested in court is enough for me not to trust the CEO's conclusory opinion.\n\nI personally would not hold my cr\\*pto on COIN until there is legal certainty the assets are safe in the case of bankruptcy. Consequently, I have a negative outlook on COIN's custody business; therefore, I have a negative outlook on COIN's so-called moat and ability to upsell new customer's into more products. If people start using COIN for best-price execution only and begin moving their coins to another platform to hold and use their cr\\*pto, then COIN's ceiling is a cr\\*pto trading platform, not the all-service cr\\*pto platform management is selling to investors.",
