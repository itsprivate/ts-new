  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 19, 2022**\n\nStocks ended a volatile session sharply lower, with soaring treasury yields pressuring technology and growth stocks. The Nasdaq (QQQ) closed -1.10% lower to officially enter into correction territory, with the technology-led index falling more than 10% from previous highs. Moreover, market participants digested company reports as Q4 earnings season kicks off. \n\nTreasury yields gave back some recent gains, and the benchmark 10-year yield retreated after nearing 1.9% a day earlier for its highest level since January 2020. Commodity prices advanced further, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rose above $87 per barrel, its highest level since 2014.\n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.04%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.10%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.99%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.63%\n* Apple (AAPL): -2.10%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): -3.68%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -3.38%\n* Gold Miners (GDX): +6.93%\n* Social Finance Technologies (SOFI): +14.28%\n* First Majestic Silver (AU): +12.24%\n* Ford Motors (F): -8.37%\n\nRecent market volatility can be attributed to the multidecade jump in consumer and producer prices reported last week, which served as a reminder that inflation remains the key driver of risk and uncertainty in the year ahead. \n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 7% in December compared to a year ago, the fastest pace of increase since 1982 and the eighth straight month in which inflation exceeded 5%. Excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, core CPI rose 5.5%, the most since 1991.\n\nLike last year, inflation in the prices of goods played a large part in the jump. For example, prices of used cars and trucks soared 37%, and furniture prices rose 14% from a year ago. While pandemic-related supply-and-demand imbalances continue to drive prices for durable goods higher, services inflation is also strengthening but to a lesser extent, rising 3.7% in December. \n\nOn the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.\n\nThe extent to the rise in prices caused the Fed to pivot to a more hawkish stance, with policy suggesting the Central Bank stance is shifting from supporting the economy and the labor market to combating ongoing inflation. With higher prices persisting at a higher level than originally expected, members of the Fed are now calling for three to four interest rate hikes next year, with the earliest projected for March 2022. \n\nCombined with elevated inflation reading, in December the unemployment rate ticked below 4% solidifying the Fed’s reasoning to raise the interest rate “relatively soon”. The upcoming start to the Fed's tightening cycle, the sixth over the last 40 years, is a milestone that reflects not only the unexpected inflation overshoot but also the strength of the economic expansion and the labor market.\n\nDavid Bailing, Chief Investment Officer at Citi Global Wealth, said “I think it's definitely a repositioning of the market to deal with really what the Fed has done. And the Fed has basically created some certainty around the fact that there will be rate rises. Then the question is, how much do they actually release from their portfolio? And it's that that creates enormous uncertainty.”\n\nHe continued, “What we're seeing now is a broad-based reevaluation of the highest growth shares, which obviously are the most sensitive to interest rates. But what's happened is it's taking place across the board. This is going to present a buying opportunity in areas like fintech, in areas like cybersecurity, where you have very steady growth, you have increased cash flows and potential profitability, as opposed to the more speculative shares.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Microsoft (MSFT) acquired beleaguered videogame maker Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) in a blockbuster $70 billion deal. Not to get into it, but ATVI has been facing some massive controversies recently. \n* Shares of Social Finance Technologies (SOFI) soared after the company received approval from the Office of the Comptroller of Current and the Federal Reserve to become a bank holding company. In order to become a bank, SoFi plans to acquire California community lender Golden Pacific Bancorp and operate its bank subsidiary as SoFi Bank. The deal was announced last year and is expected to close in February.\n* The Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee is seeking to list publicly in the United States after being removed from the Nasdaq in 2020 following an accounting scandal, according to a report from the Financial Times. \n* Housing starts rose at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.702 million in December, climbing by 1.4% compared to November's revised rate, according to Commerce Department data Wednesday. In November, new homebuilding increased at an 8.1% rate, which was downwardly revised from the 11.8% increase previously reported.\n* China's cyberspace regulator has drafted new guidelines mandating the country's internet behemoths obtain its approval before undertaking any investments or fundraisings, Reuters reports. Cyberspace Administration of China's (CAC) guidelines will apply to any platform company with over 100 million users or plus 10 billion yuan ($1.58 billion) in revenue.\n* Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it gained $8.2 billion on its $800 million investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian (RIVN).\n\n“The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.\" - *Franklin D. Roosevelt*",
