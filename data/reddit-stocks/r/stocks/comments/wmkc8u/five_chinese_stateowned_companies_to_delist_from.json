The companies, which also include Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) [**(601600.SS)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/601600.SS), PetroChina [**(601857.SS)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/601857.SS) and Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co [**(600688.SS)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/600688.SS), said in separate statements that they would apply for delistings of their American Depository Shares from later this month. The five, which were added to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) list in May after they were identified as not meeting U.S regulators' auditing standards, will keep their listings in Hong Kong and mainland Chinese markets. There was no mention of the auditing row in separate statements by the Chinese companies outlining their moves, which come amid heightened tensions after last week's visit to Taiwan by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",
