The request will be made at its 2022 annual shareholders meeting expected in October.\n\nThe stock rallied 5.8% in premarket trading, putting them on track to open at the highest price seen during regular-session hours since Jan. 13. It slipped 0.3% on Friday to close at $1,010.64, to snap an eight-day winning streak. Monday’s rally comes even after a report that Tesla will pause production in China amid new COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nTesla had 1.033 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31. In the 2021 proxy statement, the company said it is authorized to have 2.00 billion shares outstanding.\n\nThe company’s only other stock split, a 5-to-1 split, took effect on Aug. 31, 2020. At that time, the stock was trading at a pre-split-adjusted price of about $2,213. The stock closed Aug. 31 at split-adjusted $498.32.\n\nTo lower the stock price to around that level, Tesla would have to increase number of shares it is authorized to have outstanding by more than 1 billion, so it could enact a 2-for-1 split. To match the previous 5-for-1 split, the number of authorized shares outstanding would have to increase by more than 3 billion.\n\nAlthough a stock split doesn’t change anything about a companies fundamentals, it has historically helped boost the stock price as it is viewed as a sign of management’s confidence that the stock will continue to perform well, as Mark Hulbert has written for MarketWatch.\n\nTesla’s stock had soared 78% from the time the company said after the Aug. 11 close that it approved a 5-for-1 stock split through Aug. 31, but then fell 33.7% over the next week. The stock didn’t close back above the Aug. 31 closing price until Nov. 19.\n\nTesla’s stock has lost 4.4% year to date through Friday, but has soared 63.4% over the past 12 months. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.51% has gained 14.3% over the past year.\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-pops-after-plans-to-enable-another-stock-split-11648468196?mod=mw_quote_news",
