Possible profit by purchasing Xilinx shares instead of AMD. \n\n---\n\n27/10/2020 Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) announces merger with Xilinx ($XLNX). \n\n[AMD Press Release 27.10.20](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing)\n\n[SEC registration 03.12.20](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000119312520309831/d83168ds4.htm#rom83168_8) \n\n######**About AMD**\n\nFor more than 50 years AMD has driven innovation in high performance computing, graphics and visualization technologies ― the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms and the data center. Hundreds of millions of consumers, leading Fortune 500 businesses and cutting-edge scientific research facilities around the world rely on AMD technology daily to improve how they live, work and play. AMD employees around the world are focused on building great products that push the boundaries of what is possible. \n\n######**About Xilinx**\n\nXilinx develops highly flexible and adaptive processing platforms that enable rapid innovation across a variety of technologies - from the cloud to the edge and to the endpoint. Xilinx is the inventor of the FPGA and Adaptive SoCs, designed to deliver the most dynamic processor technology in the industry. We partner with our customers to create scalable, differentiated and intelligent solutions to enable the adaptable, intelligent and connected world of the future.\n\n\n######**Regulatory approval**\n\n_________________\nUS: Approved\n_________________\n\nUK: Approved\n_________________\n\nEU: Approved\n_________________\nChina: Processing. Predicted to be finalized by the end of 2021.\n_________________\n\n\n\n#**Status at market close (07.10.21)**\n\nXilinx price: $158,07\n\nAMD price: $106,45\n\nAgreed share ratio: \nXilinx x1 = 1,7234x AMD\n\nCurrent share ratio: 158,07/106,45 = 1,4849\n\n1,7234/1,4849 = 1,1606 --> 16,06%\nhttps://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\n\n**My thoughts:** \n\nXilinx is currently valued higher than the share ratio by 16%. The ratio has been in the 10-15% area since the merger announcement. This means that by purchasing Xilinx shares at 158$, you’re essentially buying AMD at a discount. **($91,72 vs $106,45 /ea share)** \n\n#Possible outcomes:\n\n- AMD drops in value until the price is equal AMD*1,7234 = Xilinx stock value\n\n- Xilinx rises until its value is Xilinx/1,7234 = AMD stock value\n\n- Market crash. Both stocks fall in value, but AMD will have a greater negative than Xilinx\n\n- Merger is rejected. \n\n- If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including the failure to receive certain required regulatory approvals, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including if the AMD board of directors changes its recommendation, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion. (Copied from the SEC doc.)\n\n- AMD drops? Xilinx drops? Idk how this’ll play out. \n\n-\tBoth Stocks rise in value. Xilinx more than AMD. \n\n\n \n \n\n\n**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Most of my portfolio consists of Xilinx shares. I sold my AMD shares at 114$ as I figured the only way forward was for the ratio to even out.** \n\n\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in AMD’s or Xilinx’s respective businesses, operations and prospects, the uncertainty as to the extent of the duration, scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, interest rates, general market, industry and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the respective prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock, federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the industry segments in which AMD and Xilinx operate, and the timing of the merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals.",
