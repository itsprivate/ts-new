It&#39;s put me in a tough investing situation because I&#39;m a bit of a junkie and I like to get into stocks after DD, but have not had the cash to do so. Unfortunately that&#39;s led to me selling portions of my winners for profits to try and make profits elsewhere, and though I&#39;ve maintained good gains and been able to diversify it seems that the stocks I sell always out preform the stocks I buy, at least so far. In any case I guess what I&#39;m saying is I&#39;ve learned to be patient, utilize your watch lists and only sell winners if you believe they&#39;ve capped out, not so you can free up funds to chase other winners. Good luck everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
