Companies with revenue growth of 40%+ YoY, terrific balance sheets, good business models in growing markets still in the infancy of their business life cycles . All the type of things a person wishing to buy stocks and hold for the long term absolutely love to see. Fast forward to today and you can hardly give these types of stock away. Sentiment could not be lower.

Yet here it is, 60% down from its highs, trading at 2019 levels, and its making more money than ever, with no sign of that slowing down as it continues to generate more revenue per customer every quarter.   \n\n\nThe market it currently full of stocks like this. The likes of Square, Palantir, Crowdstrike, Draftkings, cloudfare, SoFi; all the stocks that got people so excited 12 months ago. They are all making more money now (quite a lot more) than they were this time last year but are trading at half the valuations. This is exactly the scenario people should want. All those reasons for optimism last year are still valid, arguably more so.   \n\n\nFor me, ive decided to sell some of my safer investments and open big positions in some of these stocks now with the intention of holding them for a long time. If they market continues to drop, thats fine, I will buy more. Because at these valuations, I feel a heck of a lot more comfortable.",
