  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, January 11, 2022**\n\nAfter one of the wildest days I’ve experienced in the market, stocks carried on yesterday’s momentum, with all three major indexes advancing as market participants digested new testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. \n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.91%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.52%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.50%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.05%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.05%\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +4.02%\n* Sea Limited (SE): +6.01%\n* Albertsons (ACI): -9.56%\n* Virgin Orbit (VORB): +27.83%\n* Shake Shack (SHAK): +12.14%\n* Amazon (AMZN): +2.40%\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing before Congress, Powell said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.\n\nHe said, “As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we’ll be normalizing policy, meaning we’re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we’ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that’s just the road to normalizing policy.”\n\nPowell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, “If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.”\n\nPowell said the moves are in response to an economy with a strong labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.9% in December, but elevated inflation. Powell said, “What that \\[the unemployment rate coupled with elevated inflation\\] is really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we’ve had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. We’re really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it’s a long road to normal from where we are.”\n\nThe Fed’s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, “We can affect the demand side, we can’t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.”\n\nMeanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield, which reached a yearly higher at 1.8% yesterday, came down after Powell’s speech, hovering at 1.741% at the time of writing. \n\nSteven Wieting, Global Chief Investment Strategist at Citigroup, said “We’re seeing across the board a re-rating of what the Federal Reserve will do. The likelihood is very clear that the Fed will succeed in sinking inflation. That is going to happen one way or the other and we are just trying to gather how actively the Fed will be doing that.”\n\nRegarding interest rate hikes, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, \"It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December’s Consumer Price Index Friday, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility. \n\nMoreover, at the end of the week, big financial institutions, including JP Morgan (JPM), Blackrock (BLK), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Intel (INTC) analysts gave a nod of approval to the chipmaker on its move to recruit Micron’s (MU) David Zinsner to serve as Chief Financial Officer as part of a broader shakeup by CEO Pat Gelsinger. \"Intel now has a 'dream team,' with 'one of the best CEOs and one of the best CFOs in the semiconductor industry,'\" Citi analysts said. Zinsner \"has driven higher operating margins at every public company he has been CFO at.\"\n* The National Federation of Independent Business reported that its Small Business Optimism Index rose 0.5 point to 98.9 last month. Of small business owners who responded to the organization’s survey, 22% said inflation was their primary operating concern — up from 18% in November.\n* Tesla Inc sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Tuesday.\n* The U.S. judge hearing the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Facebook said on Tuesday that he would not dismiss the government's lawsuit.\n* Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, is reducing overdraft fees from $35 to $10 starting in May and will stop charging overdraft fees in February.\n* Twitter (TWTR) has become a minority stakeholder in digital advertising company Aleph. CEO of Aleph said, “We are honored to have Twitter as an investor in Aleph. Their investment is a clear endorsement of our efforts to educate a new generation of digital professionals equally around the globe.\"\n* Back Market, the French marketplace dedicated to refurbished smartphones and electronic devices, said on Tuesday it had closed an investment round of $510 million, bringing its total valuation to $5.7 billion.\n* Nvidia is launching a new 12GB model of its RTX 3080 today. Revealed initially in Nvidia’s latest GeForce drivers, the new 12GB model goes on sale today from select board partners and offers 2GB more memory than the original 10GB RTX 3080.\n* NVIDIA and Arm submitted a 28-page written submission to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority outlining why the $40 billion acquisition should be approved. In it, both companies accuse critics of “romanticizing” Arm’s history, ignoring the company’s current financial condition, and overstating Arm’s market power. Arm’s energy-efficient chip designs are used in 95% of the world’s smartphones and 95% of the chips designed in China. \n* Block (SQ) is reportedly working on building its own application-specific integrated circuit designed to mine digital currencies.\n* Amazon (AMZN) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $4000 to $4200. \n* Anthem (ANTM) target raised by Sanford Bernstein from $559 to $574\n* Interactive Brokers (IBKR) target raised by Goldman Sachs from $81 to $96\n* Fiserv (FISV) target raised by Raymond James from $111 to $122\n* Mastercard (MA) target raised by Raymond James from $430 to $435\n* UnitedHealth (UNH) target raised by Sanford Bernstein from $508 to $564 \n* Visa (BV) target raised by Raymond James from $263 to $265\n\n**\"I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.\" -*****Thomas Jefferson***",
