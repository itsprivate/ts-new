I missed a couple of shows because I watch from the UK so can only get it online through some shitty VPN.\n\nI ended up putting a minimum of £100 and a maximum of £345 into each stock.\n\nAnyway, here's the results; I'll start with the one he recommended first, about 9 days ago, and build up to the most recent;\n\n* Chewy - Up 6.8%\n* American Express (he pushed this hard for 3 days) - Up 1.59%\n* Facebook - Up 5%\n* Ford - Up 1.17%\n* Citibank - Up 4.68%\n* TakeTwo - Up 3.48%\n* Wells Fargo - Up 0.11%\n\nHe also pumped several others, which I didn't invest in. These are;\n\nClean Energy, down about 50 cents, but it's a meme stock so it's unpredictable.\n\nKinder Morgan - He pumped this about 2 weeks ago before I started my test, it's about evens.\n\nPerkin Elmer - He pushed this for 2 days, its up about 7 dollars.\n\nSo yeah, Jimmy C. Might not be a bad follow after all. I know he can be a bit snakey, but in reality, if I was to dump my lifes savings into the stocks that he'd been offering advice on, I'd have a return of 22% in the space of a week. That's meme stock territory gains on its own, but done with with stocks that are pretty much 'classic' low risk stocks and kinda bulletproof.\n\nAny thoughts on Jimmy chill?",
