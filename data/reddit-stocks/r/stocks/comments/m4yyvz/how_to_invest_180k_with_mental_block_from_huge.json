The cash had been sitting in my brokerage earning 0% interest for the past year. I am in Canada and the cash are sitting in a RRSP hence i did not transfer it into a interest bearing account because I wanted the cash to remain liquid in a event of a crash. I kept hoping the market would crash so I could buy back in cheaper and that has cost me 2 years of my salary in missed gains. Seeing these gigantic rallies every day I am getting serious FOMO but is also conflicted as buying back in now will be locking in my losses. I dont think I have the mental strength to hold on to all cash much longer and I know I shouldn&#39;t of tried to time the market in the first place but I feel I&#39;m in too deep at this point. I feel like doing a lump sum and be done with it  so i can be free from my mental anguish but with markets at ATH i am still somewhat hesitant, I don&#39;t want to FOMO in at the top and see my holdings crash. Would DCA be a better option? </p>\n\n<p>100K of this money is actually for my parents&#39; retirement. They will be retiring within 5-8 years. I sold their 2% MER mutual fund last year and wanted to buy back the ETF equivalent but because of my greediness I wanted to time the bottom and to buy in cheaper and the market just kept shooting up and i never bought in. The mutual fund allocation was 60/40 equity/fixed income and I was thinking to mirror that but seeing how much bonds are taking a beating and with potential further increases in interest in the near future I&#39;m not sure if bonds are a good idea. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m comfortable in going with an all equity allocation either due to my parent&#39;s short time horizon, can anyone suggest some alternatives?</p>\n\n<p>I know i fucked up huge and probably shouldn&#39;t be doing DIY investing. But please, I am already feeling dead inside. Missing the greatest bull market in history will most likely haunt me for the remainder of my life.  I will never touch the holdings again once fully invested. Would just like some advice on how to put my parent&#39;s money back into the market.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
