Adjusted profit also surpassed estimates, coming in at **$2.55 a share, compared with an estimate of $2.46**.\n\nThe Big Mac seller said US sales growth was helped by strategic price increases and value offerings. The company had said in April that some diners were trading down to less expensive menu options. The popularity of digital sales, including the mobile app and delivery, so far appears to be offsetting pressure consumers are facing from decades-high inflation.\n\nThe chain has largely been a winner during the pandemic due to its drive-thru lanes. **Digital sales** are also growing, topping** $6 billion in the quarter in the top six markets**, accounting for almost a** third of their total sales.**\n\nMargins have been under pressure across the industry because of supply-chain problems and wage increases. McDonald’s said its** total restaurant margin rose 3% in the quarter, or 8% excluding currency translation.**\n\n[Source: Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/mcdonald-s-sales-top-estimates-on-price-hikes-value-offerings?srnd=premium)",
