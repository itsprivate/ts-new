In my view, there is no material misrepresentation because Twitter's SEC filings are adequately hedged and make clear the true number of bots might be much higher than 5 percent. Musk does not have a legal reason to get out of the deal. \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/twitter-committed-elon-musks-44-billion-deal-2022-05-17/\n\nIf Musk and Twitter get into a legal dispute, the most likely result is the deal gets a small haircut and closes at a slightly lower price, not the 25 percent discount Musk wants for the bot issue. The most comparable case is Tiffany v. LMVH where Tiffany sued for specific performance to force LMVH to close. The lawsuit settled with the deal closing at $15.8b, which was only a $425m (2.6 percent) haircut on the original contract price of $16.2 billion. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/29/lvmh-agrees-158bn-takeover-of-tiffany\n\nThis past Friday, the window closed for the FTC to bring a lengthy antitrust review of the deal. In my view, there is little risk of antitrust enforcement given Twitter's business is not related to Musk's other companies. \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-says-waiting-period-musks-123424926.html\n\nMusk is sending buying signals: selling equity in $TSLA, restructuring his financing to eliminate the margin loan, and bashing work from home. (Twitter had the most lenient WFH policy of any tech major.) Twitter is sending signals it has been bought: working on the edit button, telling staff the deal will close, and redirecting employees to focus on user growth rather than niche projects. \n\nhttps://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/twitter-enters-restructuring-mode-focuses-on-user-growth-says-report-122060201069_1.html\n\nAt current prices, upside if the deal closes at $54.20 is 35.5 percent. Twitter's all-time low is $20 representing a 50 percent downside. However, for the reasons above, it is much more likely than not the deal closes. Further, downside risk can be managed, for example, with stops at $32. \n\nIn my view, $TWTR represents one of the best risk/reward profiles, is event-driven with the deal expected to close this year, and the stock is showing good strength while the rest of the market is selling off. \n\nAny counterpoints?",
