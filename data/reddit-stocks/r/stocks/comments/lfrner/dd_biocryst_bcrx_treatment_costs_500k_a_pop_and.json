There’s about 10,750 HAE patients in the U.S. alone.</p>\n\n<p>Let me take a pause to mention that having HAE fucking sucks. People get massive swelling pretty much completely randomly, including in their airway (bad — can’t breathe) or their gut (bad — vomiting, can’t eat). The treatment fucking sucks, which is basically getting C1 inhibitor from donor blood administered IV (or more commonly fresh frozen plasma which contains C1 inhibitors). As you might imagine this is incredibly fucking disruptive to their life.</p>\n\n<p>So given the fresh DD on $BCRX, I thought to myself, “the parts of my brain used for numbers are smooth because I just memorized everything like they said to in medical school, but here’s something I can get real insight into!”</p>\n\n<p>I spoke with a few of my colleagues in Hematology who mentioned that they’ve had tons of patients switch from Haegarda (requires injection) and Cinryze (requires injection) to Orladeyo (just an oral pill). Patients hate self-injecting medications. Many of them are queasy, or you have to get a family member to help you, and it reminds you that you’re chronically sick. We have patients who go to the emergency room over and over again because we can’t convince them to start on new medications. All of these patients have been started on Orladeyo and have since avoided the ER, saving society tons of money.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: $12C 1/21/22 x 500 at an average cost of $4 in the last week (to account for earnings from this year’s Berotralstat sales) -- it&#39;s traded sideways so far.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
