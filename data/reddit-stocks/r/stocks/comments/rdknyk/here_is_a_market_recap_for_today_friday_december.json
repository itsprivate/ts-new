  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 10, 2021**\n\nStocks ended broadly higher today as market participants shrugged off the new Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is roughly in line with economist expectations ahead of the Federal Reserve final meeting of the year, a sign that market participants. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed today. Looking ahead, market participants wait for the Federal Reserve’s final policy-setting meeting next week. \n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* CPI: +6.8%\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.94%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.9%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.59%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.28%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -6.40%\n* Apple (AAPL): + 2.8%\n* Microsoft (MSFT): +2.78%\n* Grab (GRAB) -12.75%\n* Oracle (ORCL): +15.61%\n\nThe Labor Department released the Consumer Price Index, which showed the rate of inflation coming in at a multi-decade high for the month of November. CPI climbed 6.8% in a year-over-year period, marking the fastest rate of inflation since June 1982. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the “core” CPI came in at 4.9%. \n\nOn the other hand, new weekly unemployment claims in the US plunged to the lowest level since 1969, coming in even below pre-pandemic. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended Dec. 4:** 184,000 vs. 220,000 expected and an upwardly revised 227,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended Nov. 27:** 1.992 million vs. 1.910 million expected and a downwardly revised 1.954 million during prior week\n\nCurrently, the US has more than 11 million job openings, highling how tight the labor market is becoming in the US. A tight labor market combined with elevated inflation will likely make the Federal Reserve to finish quantitative tapering sooner than expected. \n\nSeema Shah, Chief Investment Strategist at Principal Global Investors, said “Wage increases are probably on the agenda for next year. That's part of the broadening of inflationary pressures that we've already started to see come through in some of that CPI data. But I have to say that we're not so worried because we're starting to see other parts of the inflation picture actually starting to fade. So at the end of next year, 12 months from now, we're not expecting the kind of 6-7% CPI numbers ... We're thinking more like 3% level for 12 months time.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Ford Motors (F) gapped up roughly 10% today to reach the highest stock price in roughly two decades, with investors impressed by the company’s pivot to electric vehicles. \n* The University of Michigan;s December Survey of Consumers saw a bigger than expected increase in Consumer Sentiment after reaching a decade-low last month. The Consumer Sentiment Index came in at 70.4, better than 68.0 expected and 67.4 recorded in November.\n* Apple (AAPL) stock has been absolutely on fire recently, with the company reaching a fresh record-high today as it inches to a $3 trillion market cap ($2.94 trillion at the time of writing). Absolutely insane.\n* Oracle (ORCL) stock popped off after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. \n* Shares of Costco (COST) hit a new record-high after posting better than expected earnings amid ongoing global supply chains. \n* U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp is set to secure unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $16 billion bid for artificial intelligence and speech technology firm Nuance Communications Inc, people familiar with the matter said.\n* Amazon said that an \"an impairment of several network devices\" in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virginia data center region caused the prolonged outage on Tuesday. The outage temporarily interrupted streaming platforms Netflix Inc and Disney+, trading app Robinhood Markets Inc and even Amazon's own e-commerce site, which makes heavy use of AWS.",
