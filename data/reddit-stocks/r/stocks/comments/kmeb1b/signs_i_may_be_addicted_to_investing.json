I&#39;m posting it here in case it could help anyone else. My problem, as I see it, is that I DO have a sound plan that DOES work. However, life happens and the stock market is an easy place to distract myself from life&#39;s worries and then I find myself - ONCE AGAIN  - in a position where I blow up my plan for some gamble and then I&#39;m down. </p>\n\n<p>Like yesterday, I was groggy and didn&#39;t even follow my basic rules and KABOOM I&#39;m down like $2K today. It is so disheartening after working so hard to secure that $2K. </p>\n\n<p>I just really need to reassess my priorities and why I was taking control over some of my retirement in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>Best of luck to you all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
