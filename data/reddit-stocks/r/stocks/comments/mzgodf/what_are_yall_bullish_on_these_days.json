  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am actually quite bullish on tech right now and it&#39;s the highest percentage of my portfolio that it&#39;s ever been, more than 7%! I have positions in lam research, amd, Snap, and I want back into intel (sold before earnings because it was getting a bit crazy and easy to see the drop coming.)</p>\n\n<p>AMD I scooped up on a dip and have been happy, I bought some more today and averaged up a tiny bit. I am actually not the biggest fan of their pc parts, but it&#39;s because I&#39;m old school and just prefer intel CPUs and nvidia gpus. But many enthusiasts are actually using AMD these days, and their numbers have been well. They have a PEG of ~1.5 which doesn&#39;t exactly make it great value right now, but I think the stock is undervalued compared to peers. I will hold this and average down if when I get the opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Lam research has a PEG of 1.2 and I expected it to be higher honestly. I bought the stock with the intent to hold for long and average down over time but I haven&#39;t even had that opportunity yet. Wish I bought a bit more to trim, but I think I will stick to my guns and hold it long. </p>\n\n<p>Snaps just a long hold, definitely way overvalued, but I expect to average down at some point. I&#39;m honestly in snapchat because my portfolio has been very boring lately, and I&#39;ve owned the stock before at much lower prices. Their earnings report wasn&#39;t terrible, wasn&#39;t great, but I think as the years go on the company will be able to do well. I&#39;m not really too attached to this play, it&#39;s a small percentage and it&#39;s a bit speculative and not really my style, but for now I&#39;m a happy holder especially since they did breakeven on this earnings.</p>\n\n<p>Intel is a powerhouse and many call it a value trap, I think the markets just waiting for them to stop making mistakes and I think Pat will be able to SLOWLY turn them around. Long hold and I will buy some soon, haven&#39;t gotten back in it yet.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also extremely bullish on oil and energy. Brent has been doing very well and holding for now, and I think that the debt the oil companies has accumulated was actually beneficial because it&#39;s so cheap. Exxon and chevron I love, as well as the pipelines. (I sold all my enbridge early, and may sell some puts to try and get back in at a small discount)</p>\n\n<p>Carbon capture is a tried and true method of reducing emissions, albeit not the best way of going green, but it will be profitable IF Biden can put a price on co2. BP, shell, and exxon all already do this as well as many other companies. Don&#39;t know too much about it but I did some light reading for a couple hours and it&#39;s old stuff been around since the 70s, but it does work and is a realistic next step in reducing emissions. Definitely not a permanent solution but I see it as a necessary stepping stone and there may be money to be made.</p>\n\n<p>Oil is also not going anywhere for at least a decade, probably longer, so I believe these companies are all extremely undervalued even after their run ups. Going forward 2 years I think even when oil prices normalize,  I think the giants will be in a better position overall. </p>\n\n<p>I like GE for their wind turbines as well, although it&#39;s much smaller scale and doesn&#39;t really bring much to stock price. I believe Siemens does this as well, but I do not own siemens. With Biden in office and oil prices getting high, it&#39;s the perfect storm for greener energies.</p>\n\n<p>I went into this earnings season a bit bearish and I still expect it to be rocky, so properly hedging should be on everybodies list as well. But I believe the bull market will be fine over the next year, albeit not completely smooth. Healthcare is a solid industry to invest in during times like these as the big names are quite undervalued. I&#39;m not bullish on healthcare, but it&#39;s a savings account and it&#39;s not volatile when everything else is, so its a defensive play when IV is very low.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
