The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.</p>\n\n<p>Prospects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental factors, such as favorable fiscal and monetary policy and growing corporate earnings, remain in place to support a post-pandemic bull market. Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury Yield rate made by Bloomberg📷</p>\n\n<p>The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has so far seen just under 64.2 million doses administered to Americans as of Monday morning, according to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 75.3 million doses have so far been delivered to states, inclusive of both Moderna&#39;s and Pfizer&#39;s and BioNTech&#39;s vaccines. Last week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago according to data analyzed by the New York Times. The drop in cases is staggering given that on January 8, the US recorded more than 300,000 new cases. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of popular EV stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Nio (NIO), Plug Power (PLUG) and many others have been pulling back sharply in recent days.
