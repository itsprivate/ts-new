Joe Manchin (D., WVa.), said the $1.7 trillion Build Back Better social spending and climate change bill is a “no” as far as he is concerned.\n\nThe centrist Democrat told Fox News Sunday he “cannot vote to continue with this peice of legislation.” The bill, which Senate Democrats had hoped to pass by Christmas, stalled last week after prolonged negotiations between Manchin and President Joe Biden.\n\n“I’ve tried everything humanly possible,” Manchin said Sunday. “I can’t get there.”\n\nThe comments were certain to provoke a backlash by progressive members of the party, who wanted to bundle the social spending plan with the already enacted plan to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure to ensure its passage.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) told CNN on Sunday he would push to bring Build Back Better to a vote in the Senate, to force Manchin to explain to the public why he opposed it. “If he doesn’t have the courage to do the right thing for the working familiies of West Virginia and America, let him vote no in front of the whole world,” Sanders told CNN.\n\nThe bill, which the House already passed, includes spending on childcare, early education, and child tax credits. It also aims to lower prescription drug prices, expand Medicare and push for investments in clean energy, among other initiatives.\n\nLast week, Biden conceded the Senate would likely push consideration for the bill into the new year after trying to convince Manchin to support it. Manchin has balked at the dollar amount of the spending and some provisions such as paid family leave, saying the spending would add to the deficit at a time when consumers are already paying higher prices for food, fuel and other household needs.\n\n“This is a no on this legislation,” Manchin said.",
