  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, January 10, 2022**\n\nToday was one of the wildest days I’ve seen in the markets in a long time. After sinking more than 2.5% in the morning, the Nasdaq (QQQ) staged a remarkable red-to-green move as market participants piled in to buy the dip in technology stocks. This comes despite concerns about elevated inflation and anticipation that the Fed will likely raise interest rates “relatively soon”.\n\nSignificantly, volume in the tech-heavy Nasdaq was roughly double the average volume traded, with 90 million shares traded today, compared to an average volume of 46 million shares traded.\n\n**Markets Today (listed from lowes of the day to closing price)**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -2.0% lowes, 0.12% close\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -2.70% lowes, +0.07% close\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.56% lowes, -0.42% close\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.20% lowes, -0.35% close\n* Volatility Index (VIX): +9.91% highs, +3.36 close\n* 10-year Treasury yield: 1.765%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -4.11% lowes, +3.03% close\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): -5.66% lowes, +0.56% close\n* Zynga (ZNGA): +40.33%\n* Take-Two Interactive (TTWO): -13.18%\n* iRhythm (IRTC): +27.44%\n\nLast week, the Fed signaled that an interest rate hike could come “relatively soon”, sparking widespread volatility among technology and growth stocks. Moreover, the Fed’s comments resulted in a sharp rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, further pressuring high growth stocks.\n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.\n\nLooking ahead, there are two big developments to keep in mind. On Tuesday, Jerome Powell will give his confirmation hearing to Congress (he was recently re-elected as Fed chair). He is expected to lay out to lawmakers his expectations for inflation moving forward and signal on what the Fed plans to do. His hearing could potentially spark volatility, so watch out for that.\n\nIn addition to Powell’s confirmation hearing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December’s Consumer Price Index, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility.\n\nAt the end of the week, big banks including JP Morgan (JPM), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Wholesale inventories rose by 1.4% in the Commerce Department's final monthly print for November, coming in above the 1.2% rise previously reported. This came following a 2.5% increase in inventories in October.\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida [will leave the central bank](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220110a.htm) two weeks earlier than planned, following increased scrutiny into financial transactions he made in 2020.\n* JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, \"It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.\"\n* Tesla Inc on Monday said it has signed its first U.S. supply deal for nickel, choosing Talon Metals Corp's Tamarack mine project in Minnesota. Tesla will buy 75,000 tonnes of nickel over six years and buy cobalt and iron ore as well.\n* Ferrari unveiled leadership changes aimed at boosting technology as the company transitions to EVs and higher-end technology. Ernesto Lasalandra was hired from STMicroelectronics (STM) to become Ferrari's chief research and development officer, while Silvia Gabrielli, who joined Ferrari in 2019 from Microsoft (MSFT), was appointed chief digital and data officer.\n* Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the electric carmaker will raise the U.S. price of its advanced driver assistant software dubbed \"Full Self Driving\" to $12,000 on Jan. 17.\n* Apple Inc supplier Foxconn will reopen its shuttered iPhone manufacturing facility in southern India on Jan. 12, government officials and a legislator in the region where the plant is located told Reuters. The plant has been closed for about a month following a worker’s strike.\n* Intel (INTC) appointed Micron’s (MU) former finance head as its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and executive vice president.\n* The New York state gaming commission finally gave the green light to allow sports betting in the state.\n\n\"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So, throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore, Dream, Discover.\" -*Mark Twain*",
