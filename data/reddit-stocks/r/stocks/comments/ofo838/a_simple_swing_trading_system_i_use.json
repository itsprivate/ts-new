Would love to hear other people's system as well!\\*\\*\n\nHello friends!\n\nYou may know me as the guy who writes the Daily Market Recaps on here. Today, I wanted to share a small article I wrote about trading systems. I remember when I was first getting started in the market and beginning my education, I would always hear people say \"you need a trading system in order to be successful\", but didn't know what that meant or how to get started. Fast forward a few years, I have been blessed enough to make a living as a trader and investor, so I wanted to share some of the things I have learned.\n\nBasically, a trading system is a set of parameters designed to remove as much emotion from trading as possible (can't count how many mistakes I have made by getting too emotional during a trade). Today I wanted to share a very simple swing-trading system I use that only uses two indicators: Fibonacci retracements and moving averages (50, 200-day)\n\n**Enter the trade with a plan** \\- Before we enter any swing trade, we use technical analysis to find entry levels, price targets, and stop losses. Entering a trade without a plan leaves you ill-prepared to both profit if the trade works or cut your losses before the bag becomes too heavy.\n\n**Find High Probability Entry Using Technical Analysis** \\- As discussed above, I technical analysis to determine high probability levels of entry during a pullback. As a rule of thumb, always wait for confirmation that a support holds before entering a trade. I want to see either the stock bounce off the support with conviction or begin to consolidate, forming a new base near the new support.\n\n* In an uptrend, the 50 day moving average (MA) or 23.6% and 38.2%  Fibonacci retracement are usually strong supports\n* In a downtrend, the 200MA or 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement are usually strong supports\n* If a stock breaks below all these supports, wait for it to establish a new base for itself. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and 200MA are the last lines of defense, do not try and catch a falling knife. Wait for the stock to begin building a new base, patience is key.\n\n**Adhere to a 2:1 Risk/Reward ratio** \\- When entering a trade, always make sure the reward is at least double the potential risk. This way, the profit from winners is always bigger than the potential loss from the losers. I do this by setting the stop loss at 50% of the potential profit we are targeting. For example, if I am targeting a 10% gain from a trade, the stop loss will be set 5% below entry. Of course, not all trades will work out but in this way, we maximize our wins while minimizing our losses\n\n**Stick to your Stop Losses** \\-  In trading stop losses are your friend. They protect your capital in case the trade goes sour. Even the best trader’s in the world don’t get it right anytime, protecting your capital is very important. While it might be tempting to “diamond hand” and wait for recovery, the goal of trading is not to become an investor. Cut your losses quickly before they become unmanageable and move on. There is opportunity every day in the market.\n\n**If the trade works out, set stops to entry** \\- If the trade starts working out, it is very important to then raise your stop loss and set it at your original entry price. This guarantees the trade will become risk-free, meaning you will either profit or, worst-case scenario, break even. If the trade is really working out and is up a good amount from entry, I will keep raising the stop loss to protect the profit. While trading, it is imperative never to let your gains become losses, at the worst we want to walk away from a trade that is working out breaking even.",
