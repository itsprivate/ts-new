Areas like the west coast and parts of the Midwest will need to start something new to help combat the droughts due to lack of rain and large amounts of people constantly pulling on the fresh water. Israel was also dealing with the same issue a few years ago and started desalinating the water they had access too and now they’re now predicting that the water they pull from the ocean will cover 80%+ of their annual consumption. \nThat being said, I have been watching these stocks for about a year and half and they’re slowly growing. The majority of them are up between 20% - 80% in the past 5 years. Yes, it is slow compared to what some of you are looking for , but for the people who have plans for long term holdings (10+ years) if you compare it to a regular Roth IRA &amp; 401K these numbers are predicting larger average growth while the demand is constantly growing and doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon.",
