The company has indicated that augmented and virtual reality will be a key part of its strategy in the coming years.\n\nIn July, Facebook announced the formation of a team that would work on the metaverse, a classic sci-fi term Facebook has adopted to describe its vision for working and playing in a virtual world. Two months later, the company said it would elevate Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, who is currently the head of Facebook’s hardware division, to the role of chief technology officer in 2022. And in its third-quarter earnings results on Monday, the company announced that it break out Facebook Reality Labs, its hardware division, into its own reporting segment, starting in the fourth quarter.\n\nFacebook also said this week it’d spend about $10 billion over the next year developing the technologies required for building the metaverse.\n\nZuckerberg on Thursday also provided a demonstration of the company’s ambitions for the metaverse.\n\nThe demo was a Pixar-like animation of software the company hopes to build some day. The demo included users hanging out in space as cartoon-like versions of themselves or fantastical characters, like a robot, that represent their virtual selves. \n\n\n\nFacebook changes company name to Meta https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-company-name-to-meta.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard",
