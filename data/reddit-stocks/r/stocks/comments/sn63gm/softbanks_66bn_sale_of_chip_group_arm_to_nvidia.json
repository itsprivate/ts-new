A handful of big tech companies that rely on Arm’s chip designs, including Qualcomm and Microsoft, had objected to the purchase.\n\nSoftBank will receive a break-up fee of up to $1.25bn and is seeking to unload Arm through an initial public offering before the end of the year, according to one of the people.\n\nThe failure is set to result in a management upheaval at Arm, with chief executive Simon Segars being replaced by Rene Haas, head of the company’s intellectual property unit, the person added.\n\nThe collapse of the deal robs SoftBank of a big windfall it would have earned thanks to a boom in Nvidia’s stock price.\n\nThe cash-and-stock transaction was worth up to $38.5bn when it was announced in September 2020. But the value soared as Nvidia’s shares took off, reaching a peak value of $87bn last November before the tech stock reversal.\n\nThis is a developing story.
