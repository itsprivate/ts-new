Those bags are not particularly heavy, but I'm -30% on it and I'm mostly holding it now to sell at loss at some point anyway to cover for my gain tax on other holdings.    \n\n\nSeems like market found yet another thing to overreact on with announcement we all saw coming in a while: Fed's laying out their approach to tapering the QE, maybe even still in 2021. As I am writing this, futures on SPX have sinked to 4350, around 100 points below ATH, with probably still some room to go down, but I don't expect anything in the shape of true correction.\n\n  \nThe way I see it is an overreaction to the catalyst we all knew was coming and should be at least partially priced in for some time and I'm expecting S&P to go back to pushing new heights within a month. At the same time I feel like irrationality will be more impactful on more risky stocks of developing companies, depending on credit lines to remain open for cheap funding. So selling them now would probably limit my losses, and allow me to at least partially recover on my blue chip/VOO that I expect to be up and humming in no time.\n\nThis is probably quite amateur approach, but do you think there is a merit behind it?",
