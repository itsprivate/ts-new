The market is effectively raising intrest rates for the fed in the form of bond yeilds, now the fed normally would implement yeild curve control to bring it under control, however now they can only go to negative intrest rates, and negative interest rates severely affect oil and gas and other comodites, if rates go negative commodity prices will surge and bring on inflation. Now I might be wrong on that and feel free to correct me if I have made any mistakes, but if true the fed is in a really tight spot right now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
