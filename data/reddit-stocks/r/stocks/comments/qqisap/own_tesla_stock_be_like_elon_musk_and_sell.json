Mr. Musk seems to have dreamed up a cun­ning plan to try to get round this prob­lem. In­stead of an­nounc­ing he was sell­ing stock, he noted the plan by Sen. Ron Wyden to tax un­re­al­ized cap­i­tal gains, and held a Twit­ter poll on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla hold­ing. When the Twit­terati duly voted for him to dump shares in the elec­tric-car maker, that con­fused the ques­tion of whether this is an in­sider sig­nal about the share price.\n\nPer­haps Mr. Musk thinks that it’s in­sane that Tesla added $440 bil­lion to its value in the past month alone, a rise—just the rise, not the to­tal—equiv­a­lent to the com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­iza­tion of Ford, Gen­eral Mo­tors and Toy­ota.\n…\nTesla sits at the in­ter­sec­tion of three strong trends, and a change in any one of them could lead to a rapid fall back in the stock. \n\nThe first are meme stocks. Tesla is the orig­i­nal meme stock, sup­ported by in­di­vid­u­als who’ve done very well by fol­low­ing Mr. Musk, and who don’t take kindly to any­one who dis­agrees. No mat­ter the re­al­ity of sales, com­pe­ti­tion, mar­gins, sub­si­dies or any­thing else, Mr. Musk has at­tracted sup­port­ers who not only buy, but ac­tively pro­mote Tesla shares.\n\nThe sec­ond is the will­ing­ness of in­vestors to bet on the far dis­tant fu­ture. Tesla doesn’t make very much money, or in­deed very many cars, at the mo­ment. It is val­ued at $1.3 mil­lion for each of the 900,000 or so cars it is fore­cast to de­liver this year be­cause of the po­ten­tial for growth. The value of the com­pany doesn’t lie in this year or next year’s sales, but on hopes for sales and prof­its far in the fu­ture…\n\nThe third sup­port­ive trend is the de­sire for green tech­nol­ogy. It’s great to be an elec­tric-car maker at the mo­ment. Gov­ern­ments are push­ing elec­tric cars and the rest of the in­dus­try is stuck with the wrong sort of fac­to­ries, has the wrong sort of re­search ex­per­tise and hasn’t yet built ve­hi­cle-charg­ing net­works. Tesla is on the right side of gov­ern­ments and in­vestors pledg­ing ac­tion to re­duce car­bon emis­sions. Yet, if the share price change was about Tesla beat­ing the gaso­line-fu­eled com­pe­ti­tion, the shares of tra­di­tional ri­vals should be suf­fer­ing. In­stead, the value of the other car mak­ers has been ris­ing too. It would be great if the stock were do­ing well be­cause in­vestors ra­tio­nally worked out that elec­tric cars will take mar­ket share. In­stead, there has been an un­think­ing rush to buy stock in elec­tric-ve­hi­cle mak­ers, with many of the spec­u­la­tive pure-elec­tric-ve­hi­cle stocks that fell hard from a peak early this year leap­ing again in the past month (and Ford, with a new elec­tric F-150 on the way, soar­ing).”\n\nSource (James Mackintosh): https://www.wsj.com/articles/own-tesla-stock-be-like-elon-musk-and-sell-11636462480?st=n4vpidtxcyp9454&reflink=article_copyURL_share",
