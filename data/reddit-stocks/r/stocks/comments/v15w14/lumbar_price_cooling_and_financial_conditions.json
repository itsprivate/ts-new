I am excited to see if this holds up or not with the upcoming monthly data.\n \nMore evidence in the US is coming that inflation has peaked. Here are some snippets from this [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lumber-prices-slump-with-rising-interest-rates-11653835230?mod=hp_lead_pos8).\n\n\n[Lumber prices](https://i.imgur.com/RQPQM7V.png) are crashing:\n\n&gt; Lumber futures for July delivery ended Friday at $695.10 per thousand board feet, **down 52% from a high in early March.** On-the-spot wood prices have plunged, too. Pricing service Random Lengths said Friday that its framing composite index, which tracks cash sales, fell about 12% last week to end at $794. That is down from $1,334 in March, just before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.  \n\nMore anecdotally:\n\n&gt; In a monthly survey of building-products dealers, just **12%** of respondents said they had slightly low to very tight inventories of lumber and wood panels in April, down from **61%** that claimed low supplies a year earlier, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting. \nMoreover:\n\nHousing is being affected by rate hikes:\n\n&gt; The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was **5.1% last week**, **up from 3.1%** at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac, an increase that has further strained affordability. **Sales of newly built homes fell 16.6% in April from March**, to the lowest level since April 2020, when lockdowns convulsed markets. It was the **biggest drop in nine years**, the Commerce Department said last week. \n\n\n[Inflation expectations are cooling](https://i.imgur.com/KbNxnXB.png) and financial conditions are [tightening](https://i.imgur.com/H0HHeSK.png). These last two graphs are from Joseph Politano.\n\nOn the other hand, Europe continues to report rising inflation, but their ECB is much slower at raising rates and they are more exposed to oil prices and consequences of the Russian war. The Fed's hawkishneess has led the dollar to appreciate to historic levels not seen since 2002: [Graph of the US Dollar Index](https://i.imgur.com/ykmultg.png).\n\n[Shipping indices are also cooling](https://i.imgur.com/eowhKpO.png), according to the Drewry World Container Index. You can also see prices of routes [here](https://xsi.xeneta.com/) for short notice trips. Here is an album of some of the [graphs](https://imgur.com/a/j9HanAV).\n\nCheck out some domestic railway statistics [here](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/railroad-speed-dwell-carsonline-bnsf-csx-up-cn-cp-kcs-ns/588233/), specifically Class I railroads. [Here is an album](https://imgur.com/a/GpPZBG9) of plots.\n\nPlease post some other 'indicators' of inflation such as diesel, freight, shipping, etc. that you think are relevant. More data is better.",
