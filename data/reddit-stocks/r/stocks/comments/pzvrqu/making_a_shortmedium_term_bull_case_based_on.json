Swing trading means my horizon is between days and weeks/a few months.\n\nWhat I want to do with this post is to make a case for a short-/medium term bottom purely based on TA.\n\nI understand that there are many investors out there that think TA is complete and utter garbage but my performance to date in 2 portfolios is 33 and 36% while the S&P 500 is \"only' up 16% for the year.\nPlease don't down vote me purely based on your hate for TA.\n\nSo why would someone use TA? There was an article posted by a community member that insider trading is alive and well. The news are full of \"old\" news that someone else already knew before. The goal of TA is to find turning points based on those signals caused by insider trading.\n\nRemember: The market price reflects the true value based on every investors current knowledge.\n\nBut lets move on to the bull case!\n\nDisclaimer: r/stocks does not allow me to add charts to this post so if you really have any questions message me please. I don't want to get banned! My goal is to educate as many investors as possible. If someone can let me know how to copy paste charts in here I would highly appreciate it.\n\nMy favorite chart is the daily candlestick chart. I toggle between daily, 4h and weekly charts to get the best setup.\nI use 20, 50 and 200 moving averages, Bollinger Bands, Slow Stoch, MACD, RSI and momentum. Yes they are all almost the same but each of them gives me unique insight.\n\nLet's start with the VIX:\nIt is a measure of fear and expected market volatility.\nVIX spiked 3-19-20 and a bottom was made 3-23-2020.\nWe had 3 double spikes so far (1 week apart). One was 3-14-21. NDX 100 bottomed 3-15-21.\nWe had another one in May that matched a bottom and we had one 3 days ago and NDX 100 might have bottomed then\n\nMACD:\nMACD reading were extremely low in March, May and last week for the NDX100. As long as we trade above the 200 day average those low readings support a short-/medium term bottom. The hammer candle Friday together with the low MACD reading made a bottom very likely.\n\nRussell 2000:\nI love the Russell 2000 because it gives you a less distorted picture of the US stock market because it is not only driven by a handful of tech companies.\nRussell 2000 went sideways for most of 2021 because we strayed to far from the 200 day average. We finally touched the 200 day average and last week we made a nice hammer candle in the weekly chart. This weeks weekly candle was undecided. In the daily chart we regained the 20, 50, 200 day average and a months long uptrend line. This should bode well for higher stock prices.\n\nEurope:\nFEZ touched the 200 day average and is very likely to bounce from here.\nGerman Index is in a huge bullflag pattern.\n\nI can comment on Asia separately but the correction there seems to have stopped.\n\nSummary:\nI think based on TA we are set up for a nice year end rally. How far we can go I have no clue but 10% should be possible. Then we have to reassess. \nThis is just a short-/medium term prognosis.\n\nHappy to discuss. Please only serious discussions. Not: TA is bullshit etc.\nIf you do it right it is working.\n\nHave a great weekend and Happy Trades!",
