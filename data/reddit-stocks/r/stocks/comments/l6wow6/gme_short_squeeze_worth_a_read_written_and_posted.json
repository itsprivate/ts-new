Don&#39;t buy into the hype - shorts aren&#39;t just afraid of this Friday. Come down the rabbit hole with me.Discussion</strong>📷</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: I am mostly summarizing the aggregate of explanations currently floating around about the 1/29/21 option expiry date. I don&#39;t claim any knowledge. This is not investment advice. Do your own research, don&#39;t invest what you can&#39;t afford to lose, and if something feels wrong it probably is.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: This isn&#39;t about options (yet), it&#39;s about shares, and Institutional Investors are playing a dangerous game by convincing us (some of y&#39;all have bought in without realizing it) that a magical short squeeze has some 3-day time limit, that Friday is somehow the end game, and are hoping that when investors don&#39;t see a $5,000 short squeeze by next week they will fold and take their gains at a &quot;reasonable&quot; double-digit stock price. Don&#39;t believe them. They can survive through mid-late February before the true short squeeze smashes upward. And I&#39;ll be ready. I like this stock and believe in it&#39;s long term potential, and I think it&#39;s undervalued.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>THESIS:</strong> If institutional investors can (1) convince retail investors to sell stock at low prices and (2) convince their lenders to wait, then the 0.01% get richer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION:</strong> There is so much public sentiment (passion, enthusiasm, excitement, anger, whatever) surrounding short (~1 day) price movements*, and Friday&#39;s expiring options (these are also end of month contracts), that it seems like big clever money may be trying to artificially create a sort of bear trap for shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever happens in the next week or so (crest to $700? crash to $60?) almost means nothing in the long term, but could fool investors into giving these guys CHEAP ways out of their 140% float short interest positions. Remember, these are people who have been dumping tons of money for a long time, shorting the stock when it was <em>in the single digits</em>. They&#39;ve been hoping for a GameStop bankruptcy, and manufacturing one as best they can.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IT&#39;S DIFFERENT THIS TIME:</strong> Remember the VW infinite squeeze, where we saw <strong>weeks</strong> of crazy price movement before the actual peak. And that is a mild case, as most of the shares were held by an entity with legal, competitive, and strategic reasons and obligations forcing them to hold shares and <strong>artificially reducing the float, or available shares for trading</strong>. This reduced supply caused the short squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>However, this time around we&#39;ve got a huge short interest, much much larger by comparison than that from VW&#39;s 2008 peak, to the tune of <strong>140% of shares available for trading (float)</strong>. They&#39;ve massively overreached, and are going to pay the price for that. <strong>But they haven&#39;t yet.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SO YOU&#39;RE SAYING THERE&#39;S A CHANCE:</strong> This time, however, if the big dogs can shake shareholders hard enough, weak links break and paper hands fold and a fantastic long term play starts to seem out of reach. The market manipulation wins.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DARE TO BELIEVE:</strong> Unfortunately for the shorts, GME has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">real long term prospects</a> to revolutionize the gaming industry for consumers, and now has the attention and potential equity momentum (if they play it smart, which I think the new leadership will) to make this a reality.</p>\n\n<p>From that link above:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In GME&#39;s case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the shorts can fight, sneak, manipulate, and otherwise adjust the share price down this week then they start to see light at the end of the tunnel. They make 2-3 week plans for doing the same thing. For them, prices don&#39;t have to bottom back out, they just have to convince enough people to sell that they buy thrmselves a few weeks before a short squeeze really takes them all under.</p>\n\n<p>*Some of this price movement is shorts covering, but much is actual legitimate investment between retail investors and other institutional investors who have seen the light. Remember, TSLA didn&#39;t get to where it is because one company made some bad short positions. But if GME shorts can convince everyone that a 3-day squeeze is all they get until GME crashes to some &quot;normal&quot; level, then they win.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone getting hyped about Friday is playing into their hands. Yeah maybe some will need to take gains after a Friday pop, but a smart long-term hold position on GME is what they&#39;re really afraid of. And I want to be a shareholder in GME&#39;s future, as many wanted to be with TSLA. And sure, maybe if everyone else thinks that way too, there may be an incidental short squeeze that wrecks the uber wealthy in mid-late February along the way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Again, I am not claiming to be knowledgeable or insightful, just commenting my best guesses. Nobody knows the future. This is not investing advice.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edit: we are seeing this dangerous bias even in such reputable characters as <a href=\"/u/thicc_dads_club\">/u/thicc_dads_club</a> with his <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5x0fc/gme_endgame/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">recent speculation - GME Endgame</a>.</p>\n\n<p>🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
