There is a <a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg\">slight downward trend</a> which may continue over time as competition intensifies</li>\n<li>Something I personally find most impressive is that only <strong>4% of revenue was spent on sales &amp; marketing</strong>. The company states that <a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&amp;hl=450165:450601&amp;hl_id=vkh5d_8u5\">90% of its retail users came through word of mouth</a> which just means customers are freely marketing for the company</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly <a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg\">if you look at the quarterly figures</a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at <a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg\">this visual</a>. The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place</li>\n<li><strong>Main takeaway:</strong> Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&amp;table=38\"><strong>S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview</strong></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with <strong>a little less than $3BN in free cash flow</strong> which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):\n\n<ul>\n<li>Custodial funds are basically <strong>cash deposits customers are holding</strong> on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is <strong>restricted</strong> form using this cash</li>\n<li>This means that custodial funds actually <strong>inflate</strong> Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers</li>\n<li>As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to <strong>$300 million</strong> and their free cash flow is closer to <strong>$285 million</strong> which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures</li>\n<li>Definitions in case it’s helpful: \n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cash from operations</strong> represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Free cash flow</strong> is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&amp;table=34\"><strong>S-1 Balance Sheet Overview</strong></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>With <strong>$1BN in cash and no debt,</strong> Coinbase is in a very solid position\n\n<ul>\n<li>Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the <strong>crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings</strong> which are interrelated and offset one another</li>\n<li>The last thing I want to mention is that <strong>Coinbase’s PP&amp;E is only $50 million</strong> which is tiny compared to the company’s scale\n\n<ul>\n<li>Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&amp;E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Coinbase Valuation</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations</li>\n<li>With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = <strong>$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,</strong> which represents <strong>464% year over year growth</strong> vs. 2020</li>\n<li>Comparing against some of the <a href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png\">fastest growing software companies in the world</a>, no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year</li>\n<li>As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside\n\n<ul>\n<li>9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = <strong>$250 / share</strong></li>\n<li>11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = <strong>$313 / share</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase</strong> with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What I’m Doing</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at <strong>$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (~5% max)</strong> as I think that it&#39;s a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been\n\n<ul>\n<li>I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just <strong>pure personal speculation</strong>), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company&#39;s volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn&#39;t blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I&#39;m bullish on crypto in the long-run, I&#39;m cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
