It's basically unprecedented in our times. The only thing that comes close to it is the Great Depression, but you could argue that 2008 was even more shocking given the fact that an advanced, modern, technology-based financial system came to the brink of complete and utter failure.\n\nThat in and of itself leads to a compelling story. But what truly makes the whole thing amazing is the fact that people went on about their business like everything was fine, everything was great, and that we had entered into a new era of prosperity where nothing would or could go wrong. People like Burry were scorned, marginalized and laughed at.\n\nIt's truly amazing that the mob had no idea they were on the verge of one of the greatest societal disasters of our lifetimes. They were walking towards a precipice, blissfully unaware, and when the whole thing came crashing down, there was suddenly real fear that nothing was ever going to be the same again.\n\nI think most people around here don't understand just how scary the 2008 crisis was, and just how close we came to total financial meltdown. In retrospect it's hard to appreciate how blissfully unaware just about anyone who's anyone was about the possibility of this occurring. Those who were around and paying attention at the time seem to have forgotten, but that's in part because of the emergency measures taken by central banks around the world which helped pump asset prices but still haven't restored the real economy to normality. 13 years later and monetary policy still hasn't been normalized. The scars are still being felt around the world. Inequality is on the rise in the US, directly resulting in the populism we saw from 2016-2020, and Spain, the country where I live, has become a shadow of what it what it was pre-housing boom. This is a big deal.\n\nOf course, you wouldn't think it was a big deal if you're just a middle or upper class stock market investor. You're doing OK. The crowd marches onward, blissfully ignorant of the fact that the economy and markets are complex adaptive systems that have the potential for failure at any moment. Unprecedented liquidity and monetary policy do not help this situation, and even Bernanke spoke about weighing the \"costs and risks\" of these policies when they were first implemented 13 years ago.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what's going to happen, but the mystique around Burry is that he was seemingly the only one who was sensible at a time when the rest of the world was marching blindly off a cliff. I think for a lot of people he's seen as the voice of reason against human greed, ignorance, and stupidity. Burry was always an outcast, and it took an outcast to say \"hey, what the mob is doing isn't right\". It took courage, and it took vision.\n\nWhat's going to happen going forward, I don't know. But to those of us who feel the world is a little more complicated than most people want to let on, and that markets (and life) aren't always smooth sailing, Michael Burry represents an alternative voice.  It's a voice that's willing to call things as they are, even if it's not always comfortable to look at them that way.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, it's not about raining on a parade, or preaching gloom and doom.  It's about seeking prosperity in a way that is sustainable and just, and moving forward in a way which takes into account the risks and does an adequate job of preparing for them.  True prosperity cannot be founded on lies and wishful thinking, and 2008 was the perfect illustration of that.",
