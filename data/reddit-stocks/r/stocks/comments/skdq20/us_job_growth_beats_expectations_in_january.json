Data for December was revised higher to show 510,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 199,000.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 150,000 jobs added in January. Estimates ranged from a decrease of 400,000 to a gain of 385,000 jobs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The labor market resilience could alter expectations that economic growth would slow significantly in the first quarter after robust growth in the fourth quarter. Economists had been bracing for a disappointment as the government surveyed businesses for payrolls in mid-January, when Omicron infections were peaking.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey, published in mid-January, showed 8.8 million people reported not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10.
