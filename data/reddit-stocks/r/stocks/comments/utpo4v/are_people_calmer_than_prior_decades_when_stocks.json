That led me to start searching myself for similar historic conversations, as you can imagine, there is not that much for the 2000 bubble as the internet was still in its infancy but there is quite a bit out there for 2008-09.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that people really panicked, like a lot. Way worse than on here, and the posters didn't seem to be teenagers, these were older, more established people. A lot of people talking about selling for huge losses and how the economy will never recover etc etc. There was absolutely no talk what so ever about buying dips. A few people talked about holding and waiting for a recovery but I didnt see one person talk about it as an opportunity or doubling down.\n\nThese days people seem very confident that no matter how bad things in the market get, it will recover. And that the greatest time for building wealth is to buy at the bottom and DCA as it goes further. That is like, a pure common knowledge thing to even the newer investors now. Probably thanks to the wealth of information that is the modern internet.\n\nIdk here, just thought the mentality shift was interesting. Obviously I know we have a long way to go and another 15-20% decline may blow this theory into dust but i'm not sure. I think there will be a hell of a lot of people still highly motivated to buy even in that scenario this time around.",
