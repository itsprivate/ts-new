When my father died, he had a decent amount of life insurance and a retirement fund that she's now living off of combined with his old pension and social security.  After she almost got swindled by one of her cousins into joining his active investment firm (at an expense ratio of 2.6% \"as a favor\", yikes), I convinced her to instead put her money in Vanguard.  She wanted some sort of advisor, so I hooked her up with their personal advisor service which was \\~.3% expense ratio.\n\nThey set her up with a suite of passively managed broad based index and bond funds, and that felt reasonable to me so I haven't asked her about it since.\n\nThis week I found out that this vanguard advisor contacted her and told her about their \"PAS active equity\" funds, and she decided to join up on those.  She hasn't told me which funds specifically - she doesn't even know which ones she agreed to - but they have already moved \\~40% of her assets over to it.\n\nI find this sketchy personally - isn't vanguard supposed to be the banner-carrier of passive investments?  When I hooked her up with this service, I wasn't expecting her to be pitched actively managed funds by anyone.\n\nDoes anyone know about these Vanguard active funds, and if this is something I should be worried about/advise her against doing?

Spending money while she's still alive\n2. A fund that can potentially help subsidize the life of my brother's two children, who both have autism (one of whom is nonverbal).\n\nWe're all encouraging her to do (1), but (2) is also on all of our minds, including her own. I do want to see these assets grow, because right now they're not enough to make sure that those kids will be comfortable when they grow up, but if it's managed correctly it could be. None of us have the money to take care of them when they get older, and I think one of the kids will be okay but I don't think the other one has much of a shot of living independently. When she dies, all of the money (if there is any left) will be going into a trust for that purpose.",
