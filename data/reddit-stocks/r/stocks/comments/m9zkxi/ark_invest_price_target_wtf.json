Using on Tesla’s vs all cars on the road in the case of Uber and Lyft? Doubling the size of the ride sharing network while driving Uber and Lyft to 0 in 4 years? </p>\n\n<p>Insurance: 300% more profitable than Progressive, State Farm, etc? 24B from essentially nothing in 4 years? Nobody in insurance has 40% margins for a reason. It’s not because they don’t know what they are doing like the Tesla fans would like you to believe.</p>\n\n<p>Growth: 80% revenue growth compounding. On a company that grew 14% in 2019 and 28% in 2020 despite still being a small company where larger growth rates are possible? Elon himself hopes for 50% growth, which in itself is pretty unrealistic as the company scales.</p>\n\n<p>Autonomy: Did anyone watch that Oakland video? This software is years out. Assuming by some miracle it was achieved by the end of 2022 (unlikely at best), that would give them roughly 2-3 years to scale from nothing to over 300 BILLION in revenue. You know, bigger than Apple and around Amazons size. </p>\n\n<p>I could go on for days. It’s insanity.</p>\n\n<p>Please, for the love of god, if you’re new to investing, don’t listen to what Ark projects. Or what any of these YouTube Tesla gurus tell you. These projections are laughable and you should be very, very skeptical of these numbers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
