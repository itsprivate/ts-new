Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.</p>\n\n<p>Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn&#39;t overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them.&quot; This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.</p>\n\n<p>Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street&#39;s response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it&#39;s pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there&#39;s no seasonal sell signal flashing, there&#39;s no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments, and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”</p>\n\n<p>The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mega-caps were down sharply today, dragging the broader market down.</li>\n<li>Big bank stocks outperformed the broader market.</li>\n<li>Factory orders rose 1.1% in March over February after a 0.5% drop the month prior, according to the Department of Commerce.
