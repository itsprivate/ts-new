Yes it’s unfortunate that you started investing at all time high’s, the market has been dropping like the time square new years ball at 12:00. Are we entering a recession? Maybe. Are we in a bear market? Yes. Is it useful to complain about current stock prices? Not really. If you invested money into the market that you needed in the short term, well that’s an unfortunate mistake to make and its likely you should have done more research prior to investing real money. Stock prices have dropped a shit ton, people are losing money. Good luck timing the market. Should you sell all your stock now that its dropped 30%? Sure if you want to, but be prepared to possibly beat yourself up if the stock ends up recovering. Good luck timing the market, seriously. Dollar cost average and take advantage if you have a steady job. If you are investing for the long term you will be fine. Really theres no point in complaining or freaking out and making a rash decision. If there was money you may need now, it shouldn’t have been in equities. Sorry for the apathetic rant, but these doomsday posts are too much.",
