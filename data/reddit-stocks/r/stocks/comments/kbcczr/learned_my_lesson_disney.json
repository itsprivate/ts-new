Some people said that they saw no way that they would reach the levels that I thought they would. I mistakenly listened to internet strangers and sold all my Disney stock to put into other plays. This week Disney is up over $20. A lot of great advice on here but this hurt. Lesson learned, when you have a hunch and do some dd, stick to your guns and don’t assume other people in here know what they’re talking about, the stock market is unpredictable in most cases and stonks only go up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
