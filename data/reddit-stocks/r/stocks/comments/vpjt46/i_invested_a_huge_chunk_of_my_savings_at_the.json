I bought stocks, etfs, and a balanced mutual fund. I immediately lost close to $20,000, because right after I bought everything, it all started going down. For example, I bought: NVDA at 276 (now 145), TGT at 245 (now 142), DIS at 140 (now 96), BRK.B at 351 (now 277), and ADBE at 460 (now 368) among many others.\n\nI am extremely depressed and don't know what to do. A friend said, \"it doesn't matter, you'll make it back.\" I tried to explain to him that it's different if you lose the money immediately. It's like you're STARTING at $80,000, and he doesn't get it and thinks I'm overreacting. I can't stop thinking about how a large chunk of the money I worked hard to save up for at least 10 years was gone in an instant. How do I recover from my terrible mistake of investing during the worst Q1 in 50 years?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for giving me a slap in the face and telling me to calm down. My plan was to buy and hold so I guess I just need to ride this crazy year out.",
