What respondents are saying (*****ISM Manufacturing Index*****)**\n\n*  “Continued strong demand has our production facilities producing as many vehicles as we have materials for; however, capacity is limited due to the global chip shortage.” \n*  “Labor is still tight, and turnover continues. Supply chain issues are is still causing customer order cuts. Trucks are scarce, and the teams are burned out from working long hours and dealing with supply constraints daily.” \n*  “Price increases appear to be slowing. Lead times are shrinking slowly, and inventories are growing. I hope we have reached the top of the hill to start down a gentle slope that lets us get back to something that resembles normal.” \n*  “Business continues to be good, with strong incoming orders from customers. Continue to battle labor, material and transportation pressures.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Supplier Deliveries (*****ISM Manufacturing Index*****)**\n\n* It's at **64.9**, down **7.3pp** from last month.\n* That's not good because anything **above 50** means it's difficult for suppliers to meet customer demands\n* But, a m/m decrease for the second consecutive month (*it was* ***75.6*** *in Oct '21*) means deliveries were incrementally faster &amp; improving\n* The index continues to reflect suppliers’ difficulties in meeting demand due to:  \n\n   * ongoing supplier hiring challenges\n   * extended raw materials lead times at all tiers\n   * high levels of input material shortages, but not explicitly mentioned as \"increasing\" per the Sep '21 edition\n   * elevated prices\n   * inconsistent transportation availability\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3.** **Customer' Inventories (*****ISM Manufacturing Index*****)**\n\n* It's at **31.7**, up **6.6pp** from last month.\n* That's not good because anything **below 50** means inventories for customers are too low, \n* But, a m/m increase means that customer inventories went higher. At 31.7, inventories are consistent with Oct '21 - Sep '21 levels.\n* This is the 17th consecutive month where the index has been at historically low levels. Last month was 25.1, which was the **second lowest level** ever (*Jul '21 was 25.0*).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4.** **Backlog of Orders (*****ISM Manufacturing Index*****)**\n\n* It's at **62.8**, up **0.9pp** from last month.\n* That's not good because anything **above 50** means a backlog, which reflects production for manufacturers not keeping up with orders from customers hence why they're in the backlog.\n* A m/m increase means backlogs expanded at a faster rate relative to Nov '21 and was unable to keep up with continuing strong new order levels\n* This is the 11th consecutive month where the index has been above 60\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5.** **# of container ships at anchor in Los Angles &amp; Long Beach**\n\n* About **45 - 50** ships were on anchor on a given day during late December\n* After adjusting for the new port policy that I discussed in my Nov '21 post, that's equivalent to **65 - 75 ships**\n* After using my adjusted measure, there's an improvement from all-time high levels of **+80 - 100**.\n* Although it's not at all-time level anymore, nonetheless: More ships at anchor = fewer ships unable to offload inventory = difficult for trade to flow\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Freightos Baltic Index (FBX): Global Container Freight Index**\n\n* Was **$9.5K** during Dec '21, down from \\~$10.0K levels during Oct '21\n* In FY '20, this was between **$1.0K - $2.0K**\n* Fewer ships available validated by # of container ships at anchor in California (*mentioned above*) means price of shipping of shipping has gone up relative to the past. Higher shipping costs makes it difficult for manufacturers to make goods and customers get the inventory they need to meet demand. Looks like the situation has incrementally improved however based on the m/m decrease.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\nExcept order backlogs, the situation improved for supplier deliveries, customer inventories, port congestion, and shipping costs. But, still a negative situation across all of my channel checks. Managers are still saying the same stuff: demand is still strong, but navigating through battle labor, material and transportation challenges to meet that demand. I'll be monitoring this data closely in Jan '21 &amp; Feb '21 since there could be some upside with the holiday season finally over so manufacturers can catch-up while there is some downside with Omicron spreading &amp; Chinese lunar new year shutdowns in Feb '21. Overall, my base case is to see some material improvement in the spring, perhaps Mar '22 - Apr '22, as we navigate through that &amp; lap a full-year of a reopening economy.",
