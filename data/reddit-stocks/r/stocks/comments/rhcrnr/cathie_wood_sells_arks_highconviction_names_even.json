However, Wood's voluntary trade disclosures shows that she's actually been  dumping some of her high-conviction names in recent days instead of  buying them.\n* Wood told Bloomberg TV in an interview last week that  \"especially in periods where our style is out of favor... what we  usually do is consolidate our holdings towards our highest-conviction  names. \\[Those\\] are the names in our top 10 -- so the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC), Square (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and so forth.\"\n* However,  a review of trading records that Ark voluntarily releases every day  shows that Wood hasn't actually been buying any of the high-conviction  names she mentioned other than ROKU, and has instead dumped shares of  TSLA and SHOP:\n\n**Ark Funds Have Been Falling**\n\n* An  Ark spokeswomen didn't immediately have any comment on the firm's  moves, but the trades appear to go against what Wood told Bloomberg her  strategy is for periods where Ark funds are sinking.\n* From Dec. 9-14, ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is -7%, ARK Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) lost 4.7%, ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) is down 9.1%, ARK Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF (BATS:ARKG) shed 3.3%, ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF) is -8% and ARK Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX) -2.6%.\n* Wood's  interview with Bloomberg TV seemed to imply that in such down periods,  Ark will buy more of the firm's high-conviction names instead of selling  them.\n* “When traditional asset  managers are managing their portfolios in a risk-off situation, they’re  diversifying to get closer to their indexes,\" the Ark chief said.  \"They’re buying index stocks and they’re selling our \\[high-conviction\\]  stocks, so we are there to pick up the pieces.”\n\n**Such Moves Aren't Necessarily Illegal**\n\n* Rachel  Spooner, a Boston College Carroll School of Management securities-law  professor and a former federal prosecutor, told that Ark  can sell stocks that Wood implied she was buying without necessarily  breaking any statutes.\n* Spooner  said that as long as Wood is showing good faith, prosecutors wouldn't go  after Ark for such a short window of seemingly contradictory trades.\n* \"If  she's acting in the best interest of her investors and that compels her  to change her mind, it's OK if she's being inconsistent with what she  said before.\"\n* But ironically, Wood's remarks came during an interview about ARK's new ARK Transparency ETF (BATS:CTRU), which focuses on companies with good transparency about their operations.\n* Wood  said that ARK considers transparency important for its own operations,  telling Bloomberg that \"we call ourselves' radically transparent.'\"\n* Meanwhile, Wood continues to defend her belief in long-term deflation despite U.S. consumer prices recently recording their largest jump in 39 years.",
