I plan to buy more if the price drops below $100.</p>\n\n<p>I’m long-term bullish, but I’ll be trying to look at the negatives too. I’ll be going over Peloton’s background and future goals, its target market, competitors, financials, and where I see it going in the long-term.</p>\n\n<p>First, here’s a very basic overview of the bull vs. bear arguments on this stock as I see them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bull Hypothesis</strong>: Peloton will be the future of connected fitness, essentially becoming the Netflix of the fitness world. It will dominate in the commercial gym and higher-income market as well as among fitness buffs, and it will also branch into the lower-income market/casual exercisers taking a section of that market share also.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bear Hypothesis:</strong> Peloton’s stock price is grossly overhyped, and its PE ratio is unreal. This is a pandemic stock, and after we recover from the pandemic, it’s going to come crashing down to reality. Other big competitors such as Apple will undercut Peloton preventing it from dominating the market. Or, there will be so many competitors that no single company will gain significantly. Either way, Peloton can’t sustain these levels and will crash long-term.</p>\n\n<p>Arguments for bullish stance:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>At-home exercise has increased and will continue to increase thanks to the convenience and cheaper cost compared to a gym, and therefore, Peloton will continue to grow as a company over the coming years.</p></li>\n<li><p>Covid will have more people going back to the gym gradually, but many will still be more cautious, and still others will have already bought into the at-home fitness system. Some will use a hybrid of gym and at-home workouts.</p></li>\n<li><p>Peloton is looking to become established in gyms. If they are able to succeed in this, it would make people more likely to subscribe to their app personally as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>The health and wellness industry is valued at 6,033.2 billion dollars, so there is plenty of room for growth for this stock. Peloton is branching out into apparel, and will likely also do nutritional products in the future. Subscriptions, apparel, and nutritional products are going to greatly increase revenue.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Arguments for bearish stance:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Peloton will not continue to grow after covid, or it will grow at a much slower level which will drop the stock value over the next 1-2 years. Right now the stock value is overblown and needs to be brought back down to a reasonable level based on its current financials.</p></li>\n<li><p>People enjoy going to the gym and once covid is over, they will be happy to go back, and at-home fitness will stagnate.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Peloton’s Background and Future Goals</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, a quick overview. Peloton is an 8-year old company that founded the pairing of gym equipment with online workout classes. It started with a bike and cycling classes. The idea is that you buy the bike (fitted with a screen) and subscribe to a monthly membership that gives you access to livestream or recorded classes, allowing you to exercise at home. You can track things like your heart rate and compare your progress to others via the leaderboard. There’s also a community/social media element to it wherein you can follow other people to see their profile/workout progress, video chat with friends, send people virtual high-fives to support them, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The CEO, John Foley, is a health nut who founded Peloton after he didn&#39;t want to fork out for a personal trainer. He found classes better, but as he got busier didn&#39;t have time to attend. That&#39;s how he came up with the concept.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of Peloton is to create an online version of real-world gym classes without the hassle of going there or paying as much for the membership/fitness classes. Currently, Peloton is branching out into other gym equipment. They have brought out a treadmill, and in December 2020 they acquired a fitness equipment maker, Precor (one of the world’s largest suppliers of commercial equipment), indicating they plan to make a variety of equipment adapted to their concept. They also provide a subscription-only service which allows people on a budget to exercise without the expensive equipment, and they also provide classes that don’t need any equipment at all (e.g. yoga, body workouts).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Target Market</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Peloton has started out aiming at a higher-income market as well as serious fitness buffs. According to the CEO, this is because they knew their equipment was too expensive to appeal to the average consumer. However, they do plan to branch out into the market of lower-income consumers as well as those who exercise on a more casual basis. They’ve started by creating their app-only subscription which doesn’t require equipment and is cheaper at $12.99/mo (the all-access membership on equipment is $39/mo). They are also working on making cheaper versions of their equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Peloton is not only aiming to target at-home fitness users, but also to get its equipment in the commercial sector. This is where the real money could potentially be made. While at-home fitness is a more accessible market for competitors, whoever becomes the dominant system in the commercial sector is more likely to become the dominant system in general. The online community and content are going to be crucial for every company in this sector going forward since it will make or break whether more people wish to join up and stay within that community.</p>\n\n<p><em>What would be the benefits of the commercial sector?</em></p>\n\n<p>If Peloton becomes the established name in gyms and hotels, users will be able to access their own personal account and stats from anywhere in the world. On holiday? No problem, you can still continue your workout. Already joined a gym? That’s cool. You can still create an account for free on the gym equipment with access to the Peloton classes for that equipment. Maybe it’ll get you hooked. Maybe you’ll get your own subscription so you can access the other classes. Commercial Pelotons also give you the option of buying your very own Peloton equipment while you use it, so if you’ve never tried Peloton and discover you like the experience you can conveniently buy home equipment for yourself while you’re on it.</p>\n\n<p>So, we see here that Peloton has a lot of potential, hence people’s excitement. At-home fitness was starting to gain ground before the pandemic, but of course the pandemic really made it rocket. This is an exciting growth sector, but like any business it comes with risk. One of the biggest risks is competitors, so let’s look at them next.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Competitors</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a lot of up-and-coming competitors, and they are only likely to increase, but I’m going to be looking at the main competitors at this time, or the ones that appear imo to have potential. They are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Apple Fitness +</p>\n\n<p>iFit/NordicTrack</p>\n\n<p>FIIT</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Apple</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, let’s tackle the behemoth – Apple. Apple brought out its Fitness + app in December 2020. It caused a bit of a stir since, let’s face it, it’s Apple. They have a fantastic track record of being innovative with excellent marketing, and as a company they have plenty of money and clout to invest into their product. They also already have a market share of ready-made consumers in the form of Apple product owners. Anyone who has an ipad, iPhone or Apple TV can start using it for a cheaper $9.99/mo.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, there’s no doubt that Apple is going to get a share of the market, but the question is how large will that market share be, and is it really a threat to Peloton?</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Android controls the mobile OS market with a 71.93% share.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has 28.07% of market share on phones</p>\n\n<p>26.4% of market share on tablets</p>\n\n<p>2% market share on TVs (Apple TV)</p>\n\n<p>Even if Apple manages to convince all of its current users to subscribe to Fitness+ (which would be fantastic for Apple), it still leaves a massive share of the market open for non-Apple users.</p>\n\n<p>Also, an Apple Watch is required if you want to be able to track your workout progress in a similar way to Peloton. Otherwise you have to input your information manually. An Apple Watch is cheaper than buying Peloton equipment of course, but it does provide another obstacle for those wishing to have the whole experience. For everyday fitness users or those on a budget, something like FIIT or iFit will probably be more attractive.</p>\n\n<p>Another very important factor is that Peloton subscriptions can also be used with Apple devices including the watch, so people can just as easily sign up for that although the monthly cost is slightly more expensive.</p>\n\n<p>Apple certainly has its advantages, and I think if they invested in integrated gym equipment they could be a real contender against Peloton, but as it stands, it appears they are focusing on a content-only style, and are aiming at the more casual fitness user who don’t need top-notch. Using an Apple Watch and ipad with some other adaptable gym equipment is not going to allow for certain metrics in the same way you’re going to get with a Peloton. As a result, Apple has a much more basic leaderboard, less of a social community, and more basic metrics. This is fine for the everyday casual user, but Peloton is going to be preferable for those who take their fitness seriously, or who have the income to drop some extra money into a more expensive, but higher quality experience.</p>\n\n<p>According to Ben Williams, global CXO of the innovation consulting agency <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GA/\">r/GA</a>, who has worked with brands including Nike, Equinox, and SoulCycle on designing connected fitness products and services. <em>“Peloton is a little more on the performance end of the spectrum, and Apple’s more of an everyday fitness kind of audience. There are certainly users in the middle, especially among Peloton subscribers who don’t own the hardware; if Apple and Peloton butt heads, it’ll be over that group.&quot;</em> (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21454265/apple-fitness-plus-competitors-gyms-exercise-fitness-workouts-watch-bikes\">https://www.theverge.com/21454265/apple-fitness-plus-competitors-gyms-exercise-fitness-workouts-watch-bikes</a>)</p>\n\n<p><strong>FIIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>FIIT is a UK-based app that is now available in 175 countries including the US. It does classes with and without equipment, as well as barre classes. It&#39;s £20/mo, although it&#39;s £10/mo if you get a yearly subscription. I couldn’t find the US pricing, but as of writing, £20 should be equivalent to approx. $28 and £10 approx. $14, so prices should be somewhere around there.</p>\n\n<p>Fiit has lower barrier to entry since you can use it with any equipment, it comes with a heart rate chest strap, and it also syncs with Apple Watch and Fitbits. Like PTON it has a leaderboard and personal board to try and beat your own rankings. However, it is less detailed than PTON&#39;s leaderboard. Fiit also offers both live and recorded classes.</p>\n\n<p>One downside for Fiit is it only plays on phones, so in order to watch Fiit classes on a TV, tablet, laptop, etc. you must manually connect it to your phone. This wouldn&#39;t be a big obstacle for people who are focused on budget over convenience, but might be for other parts of the market (e.g. those not technologically-minded or those who just want an easy setup). You can use it on the TV without a manual connection to your phone if you have SkyQ.</p>\n\n<p>FIIT has some potential in the content-only sector, but it doesn’t appear to be competing in the equipment sector, so, like Apple, it is a competitor for the mid- to lower-income/casual fitness user market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>iFit/NordicTrack</strong></p>\n\n<p>Currently, this is the competitor I see as a bigger threat to Peloton. Unlike Apple and FIIT, iFit does pair with NordicTrack gym equipment. NordicTrack is a bit cheaper than Peloton bikes, and they come with a 1-year free subscription to iFit ($15/mo or $39/mo for a family plan).</p>\n\n<p>While NordicTrack is currently focusing on at-home equipment and not commercial equipment, it could draw some of the less-tapped mid-range market (e.g. fitness buffs on a budget and more casual fitness users with a mid-range income). Then there’s the threat that it moves into the commercial market later.</p>\n\n<p>Some other pluses for iFit are –</p>\n\n<p>It uses terrain mapping data drawn from Google Maps API to emulate i</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Its terrain mapping system. <em>(&quot;iFit uses terrain mapping data drawn from the Google Maps API to emulate the inclines and declines of the map you&#39;ve drawn, and it also pulls scenery from Google Street View so you can see where you&#39;re biking. Maybe you don&#39;t need to go outside during quarantine after all. &quot;)</em></p></li>\n<li><p>It has a faster repair service than Peloton at this time. Customers of iFit report that repairs take a week with Nordictrack vs weeks with Peloton.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You can read about Peloton vs. iFit here (<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/peloton-vs-nordictrack\">https://www.tomsguide.com/news/peloton-vs-nordictrack</a>).</p>\n\n<p>iFit/NordicTrack are trailing behind Peloton at the moment with regards to brand awareness and spreading its product. Whether or not it can catch up is going to depend on its marketing skills over the next few years. However, while it’s possible it could gain some market share for the commercial sector, it will have a tough time beating Peloton as market leader, and I believe it will not be doing so for the high-income sector since its focus is on appealing to the low to mid-income sector by making their product more affordable. Peloton has achieved a cult status, and much like designer goods, that can make it more desirable even (or especially) for lower incomes, whereas being initially seen as the more “affordable option” makes it harder to rank up.</p>\n\n<p>So, while I expect NordicTrack to take some decent market share in future, I think there is more than enough of the fitness industry market to go around, and it will not hinder Peloton’s growth in any significant way over the next couple of years.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financials</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ok, so that’s competitors. Let’s look at financials.</p>\n\n<p>Peloton doesn&#39;t have a long history yet, and the pandemic obviously gave them a boost, so financials will only take us so far here. So far, their financials have seen a significant increase though net income amount is quite small in comparison to revenue.</p>\n\n<p>We saw a 104.4% increase in revenue from September 2019 - December 2019 before the pandemic had emerged on the world stage and been seen as an issue. The net income, however, did decrease by 5 million and operating income decreased by 11 million.</p>\n\n<p>This appears to be due to an increased amount of investment in R&amp;D. By Q1 (March 2020), operating/net income increased slightly despite R&amp;D expenses also increasing, which is a good sign imo. In Q2 (June 2020), the company was well into the green and R&amp;D expenses dropped significantly, increasing again in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. This on top of increased S&amp;G expenses seems to have reduced their general operating profit although it is still firmly in the green (59 million operating income as of Dec. 2020).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve taken the year from Dec. 2019 - Dec. 2020 as measurement of the company&#39;s financial health since from Dec. 2019 shows a small slice of its progress pre-pandemic after the initial furore of going public.</p>\n\n<p>· Revenue increased 99.55% (-446m to 1065m).</p>\n\n<p>· Net income increased 216.4% (-55m to 64m).</p>\n\n<p>· Operating income increased 195.2% (-62m to 59m)</p>\n\n<p>· Operating expenses increased 41.3% (259m to 366m)</p>\n\n<p>· R&amp;D Expenses increases 128.6% (21m to 48m)</p>\n\n<p>As we can see, operating expenses have increased much less in relation to the revenue/income. R&amp;D expenses, while having a high percentage increase, are acceptable to me since it is a growing company, it is not putting it in the red financially, and it&#39;s a reinvestment into the company&#39;s growth.</p>\n\n<p>Debt has slowly but steadily increased per quarter also. Net debt is currently at -619 mil. If PTON were to continue at a growth of debt of 59mil per quarter (as was reported last quarter) it would take 10 years to pay off. However, taking into account that it is currently in growth phase I&#39;d expect PTON to increase their net income within 2 years (thanks to their subscription service), hopefully putting it at a steadier pay-off phase.</p>\n\n<p>Retained earnings showed a dip in Dec. 2019 and Mar. 2020 after IPO, but is steadily increasing (albeit still heavily in the red). As of Dec. 2020 retained earnings are -561 mil. This does hold risk, but I&#39;m personally positive on their growth and am giving allowance for their reinvestment and growth at this early point.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not good for shareholders at this point though as there is a lot of uncertainty over whether Peloton can maintain the level of growth that they had during the pandemic. I am of the opinion, that while they might not maintain the same level of growth, they are still going to grow considerably, especially over 2021 when many of us are still locked into the pandemic. Also, looking at their financials, they were heading in the right direction pre-pandemic. The fact that they were given a boost in 2020 is a bonus. If they can continue to maintain their ratio of income to operating expenses, which they have been doing so far, then they’re in a strong financial position imo.</p>\n\n<p>Added to that, they have spread into Australia and have plans to spread into Asia, so providing this goes successfully, their income overall should only increase.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fundamentals</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can check out the fundamentals in this article - <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/research/peloton-stock-buy-now/\">https://www.investors.com/research/peloton-stock-buy-now/</a></p>\n\n<p>I haven’t studied fundamental analysis yet, so I’m relying on the experts for this information. As far as I can tell it seems pretty positive.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Management</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>First here’s some background on the leaders.</p>\n\n<p>The founder John Foley is a health nut who came up with the concept. He’s described as a jack-of-all-trades having worked software, hardware, e-commerce, content production, marketing and gyms. He went to Harvard Business School, and is the founder of pronto.com and proust.com which, by the looks of it, didn’t succeed. He was also the president of eCommerce at Barnes &amp; Noble. As founder of Peloton, he says he emphasises a focus on approachability – not having the hierarchical approach where the big bosses are lording it over the rest of the employees.</p>\n\n<p>The current Peloton president was ex-CEO of Barnes &amp; Noble which oversaw the launch of Nook. He resigned due to poor sales, though both he and Foley state that it couldn&#39;t win anyway since they were too late to the game behind Amazon. He was also a co-founder of gifts.com, and was Executive Vice President of Marketing and General Manager of <a href=\"http://hsn.com/\">HSN.com</a> He also served as VP for HSN, running the growing HSN.com e-commerce site. From 2000-2004, Lynch was vice president and general manager of e-commerce, for Palm Inc., where he oversaw Palm&#39;s Web properties. His earlier career included brand management positions at Seagram Universal and Guinness.</p>\n\n<p>Peloton has generally high reviews (4-4.5 stars on websites like <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Peloton-Interactive-Reviews-E734449.htm\">Glassdoor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Peloton/reviews\">indeed</a>). It’s reported to have excellent employee benefits such as a no-vacation policy (people can take time off whenever they like for as long as they choose), 401k, medical and dental, college loan down payments, as well as child care and mental health telemedicine services. Another positive point to note is that on Glassdoor, one of the approval points (most voted for) is that people approve of the CEO.</p>\n\n<p>I checked out the negative reviews, and a lot of them complain about a clique-y culture amongst staff, as well as disorganized or unfriendly management (often playing favourites). Most of these complaints seem to be in the lower-tier jobs of assembly/retail.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price Target/Conclusion</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although I think Peloton will be volatile as lockdowns end and potentially go down for the short-term, I believe Peloton will do well long-term.</p>\n\n<p>The difficulty right now is in how disconnected the share price is from the actual value, and deciding if it will, as the bears say, crash down to reality (aka a price that more accurately reflects its financials). In this area, it’s mainly speculation as far as I can tell, since growth stocks are held up by belief in the future of the company. This means a lot of the tangible growth may already be price in.</p>\n\n<p>PTON’s LTM PE ratio is currently 190.9 x at time of writing which is ridiculously high, but with the expected growth in revenue is forecast to make it a PE ratio of 4.3 x in the next 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>While I’m very leery of the fact that the stock is so disconnected from its underlying value at this point, the P/CF ratio and future forecasts put me more at ease. I think it’s still a riskier stock so I don’t plan to invest heavily, but I’m of the belief it will adjust long-term.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts are expecting PTON to double its revenue over 2021, which, providing they maintain their same consistency in expenses, would put them at approx. $1.2 billion in net income. Compare this to 2019 when it was at $-53 million.</p>\n\n<p>It’s difficult to compare this stock to others since it’s a leader in a new market niche. However, if we compare it to Netflix (a similar leader and disruptor) which has a net income of $2.76 billion and a current share price of approx. $530 per share, half that would have PTON around the $200 - $260 mark. Another point of note for me is that PTON accurately forecast there would be 4 million members out there in 2017, which it has now gained. Now the company is forecasting 100 million PTON members out of the 200 million gym goers. This would be a massive gain although, of course, it would take several years. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/06/peloton-commercial-at-ces/\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>At the moment, Netflix has 203.67 million subscribers. If Peloton could eventually get even half of the amount it is forecasting, it would put its share price in excellent standing.</p>\n\n<p>As a pessimist, I don&#39;t think it will reach $200+ in 2021 with a $1.2 billion income since PTON is a different business model, has a different product, and other financials vary. Also, due to fears about the ending pandemic, overhype and competitors, it may progress more slowly and volatilely.</p>\n\n<p>I’m conservative about Peloton’s optimism of gaining half the market, but I’m overall bullish for their future. I’m of the opinion that, while Peloton may drop in the short-term due to FUD, I think it will do well if held over 2021 so I see these next few weeks and months as a buying opportunity. I have a price target of between $200-$300 within the next 2-3 years. If it goes higher, great. Analysts seem to support the bullish view – many of them putting price targets of $130 - $200 (I think that’s the max) for 2021.</p>\n\n<p>I consider Peloton a buy now, although personally I’d like it to go a bit lower before buying more since I think short-term FUD has the chance of bringing it down a bit further, and also because I’m a newbie at this and it’s a volatile stock. If it goes sub-100 at any point, I consider it a moderate to strong buy, and if it goes sub-90 I consider it a very strong buy. I myself, will not be putting a large amount into it, but I may add a few more shares to my position gradually as it falls (if it continues to fall). All this uncertainty over the pandemic ending seems like an excellent entry point for PTON.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[Note:</strong> <em>While I was writing this DD, news also broke about a child dying due to one of the treadmills. Of course, this is a terrible thing to have happened to the family, and I feel bad to have to talk about it in terms of what it may do to the stock, but sadly that’s part and parcel of DD.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>There are not details at time of writing as to how this child died. It is listed in Peloton equipment instructions for children and pets not to be near the equipment, and there is even a safety key that is to be removed when not using the equipment. I personally do not blame Peloton for it. Sadly, treadmill deaths, while rare (3 deaths per year on average), have happened with other companies in the past, but there’s no denying it’s a terrible loss for the family and that Peloton will also likely pay for it in terms of bad PR and a possible lawsuit. They may also need to begin work on making their products more child-friendly although I’m unsure if that will be required since they’re stated as only being for users 16+.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Stock has already fallen upon the news, and I won’t be surprised if it drops more between this incident and the general FUD. In my opinion, the next few weeks/months may be quite negative for PTON until they are able to restore trust with consistent earnings, but I still hold to them being a good long-term investment</em>.<strong>]</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I hope this DD helped someone, and if you have any constructive criticism or advice I’d love to hear it. This was a slog for me since I’m learning as I go, but I enjoyed it. I’ll be practicing DD on other stocks in future so that I can “git gud”. I plan to study renewable energy next, so that may be my next post (providing this post doesn’t get downvoted to hell lol).</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> PTON stock go up, but maybe fall for short-term (Weeks? Months?) Current FUD = Good entry point. PTON be higher end of 2021. PT around $160 EOY, PT $200-300 in 2022-2023.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
