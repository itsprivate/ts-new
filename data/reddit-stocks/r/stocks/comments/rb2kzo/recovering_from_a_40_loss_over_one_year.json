  "selftext": "Hello,\n\nThis is just my experience investing for the first time during the last year and a half. Probably all very basic, but it's been such a ride for me and wanted to share today's milestone of finally not being in the red anymore.\n\n**The start**\n\nI started investing in July last year. Tried to learn as much as possible before doing so. Started with £600 but quickly kept adding more and more to £10K and beyond.\n\n**The debacle**\n\nSome investments were just moving sideways, which is quite boring, especially if you are constantly looking at your account because you are new and learning, so even though I was convinced and had strong evidence that they were going to go up -and they eventually did-, I started trading to make a few bucks every day.\n\nIt worked for most of of the trades and little by little I could afford one or two additional shares with the same money. Then the big jump up came in and got me out. Missed an about 25% jump (from 80 € to 100 €), then jumped in just to see it collapse.\n\nI lost a lot -to me- of money. Only two wrong trades resulted in an overall of over -£5K, out of the \\~£12K total investment I had done up until then. Not only that, the process was painful. Sleepless nights making up things in your mind, anxiety and stress because if you don't buy/sell at the right time then you are missing out. And, of course, you cannot time that. So it affected my sleep and health a bit over that time, and more so after losing money that you had before. You cannot undo it and you feel stupid. And to just recover you now need to have even higher percentual gains.\n\n**The recovery**\n\nAfter contending with the idea of just giving up investing entirely, I switched to long term investing. Did some research and moved everything into AAPL when it was at around $130. I kept adding as I could, and never again sold to trade (or sold at all). I could comfortably forget about it and didn't even care if it went up or down in the short term, because I was committed to stay in for years or decades. In fact, sometimes I could sympahtise with people wishing AAPL went down momentarily just to add more to what they already had. It's been a ride and taken a while, but today I can say I am so happy to not be in the red anymore. Feels so rewarding, and definitely a day I thought would take perhaps 5 or more years to arrive, instead of just about one.\n\nI know this might seem like a smaller amount of money and time to many of you, but just wanted to share my experience after one year and a half investing. I am glad I didn't give up and was patient. I am well aware of the fact that things can go up or down from here, but I am so glad I recovered from all the losses.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is just my experience and I cannot give advice since I am not an expert, but what worked for me is to really focus more on actually investing in a company you trust and think long term, rather than trading and trying to make quick money (you definitely can, but you are also more likely to lose).\n\nThanks also everyone for the discussions in this forum, which were very helpful along the way to understand how things work. Take care and good luck.",
