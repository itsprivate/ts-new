At the origination was S3 Partners&#39; announcement that the short interest for GME has drastically plummeted during the initial &quot;squeeze&quot;, to a value of ~51%. S3 Partners was, to many people, a highly trusted source of information.</p>\n\n<p>However, information thrown to the side--with perhaps less popularity--is FINRA&#39;S providence on GME&#39;s short interest, being 226%. I know many of the new members of this subreddit are unsure about where to get information or which info is misinformed and which isn&#39;t, however I believe I&#39;d put my trust in the SEC -- part of the governmental body -- over a firm, S3 partners.</p>\n\n<p>To some, I know this is not new news but it&#39;s assuring to have information which is reliable in these times strewn with misinformation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does this tell us?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Prior to the initial squeeze, the short interest to GameStop was 144%. The data provided by FINRA shows that shorts have doubled down on their position and to a greater extent, at that.</p>\n\n<p>If you still like this stock, I thought this would be useful information. </p>\n\n<p>But please, correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
