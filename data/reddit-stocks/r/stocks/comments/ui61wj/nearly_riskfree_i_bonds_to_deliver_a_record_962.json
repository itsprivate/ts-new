You can see a history of both rates here.\n\nHow to buy I bonds\n\nThere are only two ways to purchase these assets: online through TreasuryDirect, limited to $10,000 per calendar year for individuals or using your federal tax refund to buy an extra $5,000 in paper I bonds. There are redemption details for each one here.\n\nYou may also buy more I bonds through businesses, trusts or estates. For example, a married couple with separate businesses may each purchase $10,000 per company, plus $10,000 each as individuals, totaling $40,000.\n\nDrawbacks of I bonds\n\nOne of the downsides of I bonds is you can't redeem them for at least one year, said certified financial planner George Gagliardi, founder of Coromandel Wealth Management in Lexington, Massachusetts. And if you cash them in within five years, you'll lose the previous three months of interest directly before your sale.\n\n\"I think it's decent, but just like anything else, nothing is free,\" he said. \n\nAnother possible drawback is lower future returns. The variable portion of I bond rates may adjust downward every six months, and you may prefer higher-paying assets elsewhere, Gagliardi said. But there's only a one-year commitment with a three-month interest penalty if you decide to cash out early.\n\nStill, I bonds may be worth considering for assets beyond your emergency fund, said Christopher Flis, a CFP and founder of Resilient Asset Management in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\"I think that the I bond is a wonderful place for people to put the money they don't need right now,\" he said, such as an alternative to a one-year certificate of deposit.\n\nAs of May 2, the average savings account yield is under 1%, and most one-year CDs are paying less than 1.5%, according to DepositAccounts.\n\n\"But I bonds aren't a replacement for long-term funds,\" Flis added.",
