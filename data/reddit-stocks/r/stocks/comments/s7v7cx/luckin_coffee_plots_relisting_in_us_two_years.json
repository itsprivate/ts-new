They said new management and recent growth at the coffee company could prove an attractive turnround prospect for investors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A relisting would be likely to face fewer regulatory obstacles than a Chinese company pursuing an initial public offering in the US because its shares are still traded there and it has continued to file earnings reports, according to one of the people close to the situation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Luckin filed for bankruptcy in the US in 2021 to allow it to restructure its debts while its coffee shops remained open. It could move ahead with the relisting plan once it concluded the bankruptcy process, one of the people said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fraud revelations were first published in early 2020 by short seller Muddy Waters, which accused the chain of having an “inherently flawed” business model and inflating sales.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But Luckin has since expanded in China. In December, it reported that third-quarter revenues had grown 106 per cent year on year to Rmb2,350.2m ($370m). It has 5,671 stores, the majority of which are on the Chinese mainland — about 500 more outlets than its closest rival, Starbucks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shares in Luckin have continued to trade over-the-counter in the US since it was delisted, giving the company a market valuation of about $2.5bn.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“We are seeing strong performance across the business . . . with increased customer retention and order frequency \\[and\\] greater brand recognition,” said Jinyi Guo, chair and chief executive of Luckin, in its latest earnings report.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some longtime critics of the company continue to express scepticism, however. “Revenues rising sharply is something that those of us who have been following Luckin have seen before,” said Michael Norris, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, who wrote a series of articles questioning the pace of the company’s expansion ahead of its IPO in 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Luckin has restructured a large chunk of its debt, paid down a big portion of its SEC fine and appointed new auditors, according to company filings.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“They are doing financially and operationally very well . . . none of the allegations related to the quality of their coffee,” said one of the people close to Luckin.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“It’s an attractive asset because it has been doing so well in the consumer market,” the person said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shares that were previously controlled by Charles Lu, the co-founder and former chair who was voted out by shareholders in July 2020, totalling about 17 per cent of the company, are expected to be sold in the coming days, according to one person close to the matter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Luckin declined to comment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The group appointed Hong Kong accounting firm Centurion ZD CPA as its auditor last April after its previous auditor, New York-based Marcum Bernstein &amp; Pinchuk, resigned from the role stating it had “not gathered sufficient independent third-party data or conducted sufficient audit procedures to complete the audit”. EY, which audited Luckin in the run-up to its IPO, was replaced after the scandal.\n\nSource: [https://www.ft.com/content/f8327af5-5203-44fd-acc7-267c7b475fa7](https://www.ft.com/content/f8327af5-5203-44fd-acc7-267c7b475fa7)",
