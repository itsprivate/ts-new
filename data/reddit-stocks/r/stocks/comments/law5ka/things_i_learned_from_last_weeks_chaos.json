I figured I had money i was willing to risk using &lt;5% of my portfolio and I fortunately got in at $94 last Monday.</p>\n\n<p>I was seeing 3-4x gains throughout the week and I definitely got caught up in everyone else’s euphoria at WSB saying to diamond hand it to $1k. Looking back, I should have followed DFV’s footsteps last week and start locking in profits on the way up. While I’ve already learned years ago to not FOMO and buy high, I learned this week that unrealized gains are WORTHLESS and you shouldn’t hold the bag for too long. </p>\n\n<p>I still got out green and it was only &lt;5% of my portfolio. I know some people have it worse by putting in way more than they can afford to lose, but I didn’t realize how emotionally invested I would be and how bummed I would still feel for letting the crazy 3x gains slip away using. Unless the money was life changing, it wasn’t worth the emotional roller coaster IMO. </p>\n\n<p>Lessons I learned:\n-Lock in profits as soon as you start feeling euphoric from the gains</p>\n\n<p>-Don’t let other people influence your decisions </p>\n\n<p>-GET OUT once the hype train gets in</p>\n\n<p>If you guys have any other tips, please let me know!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
