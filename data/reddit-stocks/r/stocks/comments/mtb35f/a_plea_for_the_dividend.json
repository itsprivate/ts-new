In my opinion the current dividend yield isn&#39;t even half the story of what dividend investing is about. And also I believe dividend investing is a very bad term. You&#39;re not investing in a dividend, you&#39;re investing in a company that happens to distribute some of it&#39;s profits to shareholders in cash which is called a dividend. Depending on the circumstances these realized gains are taxed, but by having realized the gains you&#39;ve taken out some risk from the investment without having to reduce your stake in the company. Even if a company goes bankrupt you can have a positive ROI if you&#39;ve collected enough dividends along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I don&#39;t invest in companies which don&#39;t pay a dividend. This is because companies that pay a dividend know their damn purpose. If a company is committed to paying a dividend and has been doing so over a long period of time that has an effect on the management. Guess which company will use profits in a more responsible fashion for investing in the company, the one thats just throwing any profits they get into potential growth or the ones that only have 50% of profits available for investment? The dividend has a discilipining effect on the company. Some companies have hard commitments to increase their dividend every year. Often they already have a pretty high payout ratio. This commitment forces them to look for new growth opportunities and to be as efficient as possible with their expenses. Some companies don&#39;t manage to increase their profits for years yet their keep their dividend sustainable by finding ways to cut costs.</p>\n\n<p>Some dividend yields are distracting, on both ends of the spectrum. MSFT for example has been an incredible dividend grower. A dividend yield of currently 0.86% may seem low now but they&#39;ve been growing the dividend at such a rapid pace that the yield will increase significantly over time if they continue to do so. When I bought MSFT in 2016 the dividend yield was slightly above 2%. Now my dividend yield based on what I paid for MSFT is 3.73%. The reason the MSFT dividend yield is so low now is because the market has priced in more future growth. This goes both directions. The reason some dividend yields are so high is because the market has priced in future decline. Which is bad news for the sustainability of a dividend. XOM and T may be examples of yields that aren&#39;t sustainable like GE and KHC turned out not to be sustainable. If these companies will have to cut their 6 to 7% dividend that I don&#39;t know, but the risk of that happening is certainly higher than with a company like MSFT that is only distributing a fraction of it&#39;s profits as a dividend. Even if a company pays just a small dividend I&#39;d take that over nothing or too much because they can grow that dividend over time and if you hold long enough the yield based on what you paid can get into ridiculous areas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The dividend is what keeps things real</strong> and I don&#39;t only see it as a way of realizing profits but also as a filter to filter out bullshit companies. Sure that way some opportunities are missed but yet my dividend paying only company portfolio has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 5 years by quite a bit and some companies have increased their dividend significantly since I bought them (MSFT, BLK, PG, SAP, UL, JNJ heck even O managed reasonable dividend growth despite covid and an already high dividend yield). </p>\n\n<p>By holding these high quality dividend companies I have an ever increasing cashflow into my portfolio without having to sell shares and I can use that cashflow to enter new investments which then again start contributing to my dividend cashflow. I don&#39;t have to put a single thought to selling as long as I believe these companies are paying their dividend in sustainable fashion. This means I also don&#39;t have to care about market valuation as long as decreasing valuation isn&#39;t because of reasons seriously threatening the business of my companies. </p>\n\n<p>I believe this way of investing is not only more mentally endurable but also more successful in the long run compared to trading around hyper growth stocks. I realize many don&#39;t have that much money to invest and the dividends they initially get may seem laughable, but I guarantee 99+% of people that enter the stock market with a get rich quick mentally will sooner or later get beaten down badly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
