SQ stock jumped in extended trading amid updated guidance amid the acquisition of Afterpay.\n\nSan Francisco-based Block reported fourth-quarter earnings late Thursday. SQ stock initially fell on the earnings release. But after the earnings call with Wall Street analysts, Square stock jumped 21% to near 155 in extended trading on the stock market today.\n\nSquare earnings came in at 27 cents per adjusted share, down 15% from 32 cents in the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 23 cents a share.\n\nGross profit increased 47% to $1.18 billion vs. estimates of $1.16 billion, the company said.\n\nSquare said net revenue jumped 62% to $4.42 billion, boosted by Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.04 billion.\n\nGross payment volume from merchant customers rose 92% to $46.3 billion, in line with estimates. But gross payment volume growth is expected to slow in the March quarter.\n\nSquare said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, known as EBITDA, came in at $184 million vs. estimates of $143 million.\n\nSquare on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. Announced on Aug. 1, the deal was originally valued at $29 billion. With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing.\n\nAfterpay competes in the emerging \"buy now, pay later\" market that encroaches on credit card networks.\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-earnings-news/",
