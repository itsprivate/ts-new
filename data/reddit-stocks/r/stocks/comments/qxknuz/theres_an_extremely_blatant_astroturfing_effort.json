I want to raise awareness because this subreddit is a target.)\n\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/) post about copper miners just hit the top of /r/investing, and it's a good example of the obvious astroturfing effort that's going on.\n\nTake a look at this account's [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/KatheKnuth/submitted/) and you'll see a common pattern: a few karma-farming posts from a couple of months ago that invariably come in subreddits like /r/aww, /r/nextfuckinglevel, /r/MadeMeSmile, /r/funny, etc. Then nothing, then a submission to a stock subreddit. Anybody with experience moderating subreddits can pick this out as a bought account immediately. This is an extremely common pattern where people build up some easy karma on a clean account and then sell it for use in various promotional campaigns.\n\nTake a look at the post content and you'll see a pattern that will repeat: one or two paragraphs of content-free 'analysis' about events in whatever mining sector, then a series of 'pitch' paragraphs where they link to a random junior miner and include the ticker. Presumably this is an attempt to pump/draw attention to these stocks.\n\nI've been noticing this happening in /r/investing and /r/stocks over the past few months, here are a few examples that I picked up in just 15 minutes by searching for recent posts about 'mining', 'copper', 'gold', and other such keywords. On each of these posts note the exact same post framework and then click on the username -> 'posted' tab to see the exact same type of post history.\n\n* [/r/investing, 2 days ago, 'junior mining'](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qvx11z/is_investing_in_junior_mining_stocks_worth_it/)  \n* [/r/investing, 8 days ago, 'copper'](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qqs5bp/coppers_current_situation_is_concerning/)  \n* [/r/investing, 1 month ago, 'gold stocks'](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qb8e3y/going_big_on_some_gold_stocks/)  \n* [/r/investing, 1 month ago, 'gold mining'](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q8le51/investing_in_gold_mining_stocks_after_the_recent/)  \n* [/r/investing, 1 month ago, 'mining companies'](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/peh0q5/mining_companies_and_engaging_with_communities/)  \n* [/r/stocks, 4 days ago, 'copper prices'](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qudym9/why_do_copper_prices_still_go_down_despite_the/)  \n* [/r/stocks, 16 days ago, 'copper and lithium'](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qlsbil/im_about_to_invest_in_some_copper_and_lithium/)  \n* [/r/stocks, 1 month ago, 'copper prices'](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q3vsf4/will_the_recent_fall_in_copper_production_affect/)\n\nThis is just quickly scanning over posts in these two subreddits over the past month - it's been going on longer than that and I'm guessing is probably in other investing-related subreddits as well that I just don't see.\n\nAnyway, I don't have any personal opinion on the stocks or sectors in question, but I do feel it's good to point this out and to remind everybody that when you're reading stuff on Reddit you are not necessarily reading agenda-free or good faith discussions, you are being marketed to. So be suspicious about this stuff. Not sure how much the moderators can realistically do but maybe good for them to be aware of this as well (/u/Fauster, /u/CriticDanger, /u/ScottyStellar)",
