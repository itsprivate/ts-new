Being an investor, you most likely picked high-quality businesses that you are proud to be an owner of, and which will most likely transcend the economy because of their convincing quality, management, moat, growth etc. It's all about creating wealth even for generations to come over many years, and this is what great businesses will always help you to accomplish.\n\nIn this regard, don't worry when your portfolio takes a few nose dives every now and then. Even if the next stock market crash is going to be tomorrow at 3PM EST (sounds about right, doesn't it?) and you lose 50% of your hard-earned money, see this as a major opportunity to load up even more on businesses you love and are proud to own. Keep calm and do not sell anything at the worst times, which undoubtedly is during these short-term drawbacks.\n\n\nTDLR: Take a deep breath, don't overreact (I mean just look at SPY, it's almost as high as ever right now), trust in the businesses you own, and see even major pullbacks as life-changing opportunities to buy more shares.",
