The podcast host apologized Saturday for using the N-word repeatedly across older episodes of his show. Rogan has also faced a backlash from scientists and musicians including Neil Young for hosting a guest known for spreading  COVID-19 misinformation.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 misinformation row erupted, Spotify said it would not remove Rogan but would add content advisories to episodes that discussed COVID-19. It also announced \"platform rules\" targeting incitement of violence and hatred.\n\nPer Reuters, in his letter to Ek, DiNapoli wrote: \"As we have seen with other technology and media companies who host or publish content, the failure to successfully moderate content on a company's platforms can lead to various reputational, regulatory, legal, and financial risks.\"\n\nDiNapoli also asked Spotify to introduce a system that allows users to report content they think might violate its policies, Reuters said.\n\nNeither Spotify or DiNapoli's office immediately responded to Insider's requests for comment.\n\nDiNapoli is sole trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, one of the largest investment funds in the world, which was last valued at $267.8 billion. As such, he holds significant clout in financial markets.\n\nFunds overseen by DiNapoli held $41 million worth of Spotify stock at the end of 2021, giving him the 73rd-largest stake in the company, according to Reuters data.\n\nEk told staff in a memo on Sunday the platform will not drop Rogan, saying that \"canceling voices is a slippery slope.\"\n\nSpotify bought the rights to Rogan's show in May 2020 for a reported sum of more than $100 million.",
