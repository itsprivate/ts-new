With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.\n\n**Main Watchlist:**\n\nGapping UP:\n\n* COIN\n* TSLA\n* HOOD\n* DKNG\n* NVTA\n\nGapping DOWN:\n\n* AXSM\n* OXY\n* FANG\n* WYNN\n* DLTR\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nStocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after we saw the indices push for new ATH to end last week's trading. Berkshire Hathaway reported better-than-expected profit growth for Q2. Tesla delayed cybertruck production until 2022, but the stock is up this morning on a price target upgrade. China has been reacting to various COVID outbreaks, and I fear the US could see more strict measures in the near future as well. This is worth following closely, as any lockdowns or countermeasures could be detrimental to stocks in the short-term, particularly the reopening plays. \n\nSPY is trading a bit under 442, and we could see some indecision this morning after hitting fresh ATH on Friday. DIA and QQQ are in similar technical levels after hitting fresh ATH in Friday's trading as well. I think we could be in for some choppiness, I'll be keeping an eye on UVXY if we do see some weakness. If we see strength and a push back towards ATH, then the strength should continue. Gold and silver are down a bit this morning, while crude oil is down considerably this morning. This is worth following closely, as crude oil is up quite a bit year-to-date and could see this as a correction. Marijuana stocks have been quiet the past few days, but the charts are looking bullish, especially if we see some strength and volume in the next few days. \n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",
