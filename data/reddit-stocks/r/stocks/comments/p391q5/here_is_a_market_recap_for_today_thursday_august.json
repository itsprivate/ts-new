  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 12, 2021**\n\nStocks largely finished higher, with all three major indexes managing to close out the day in the green. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) once again recorded fresh intraday highs.  The Nasdaq (QQQ) broke two consecutive red days and finished higher today. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed relative to the major indexes, closing the day 0.26% down. It seems a pattern has emerged in the last week or so, in which the market pulls back early in the morning before reversing to the upside. Market participants continue to weigh new economic data and corporate earnings with concerns around the coronavirus Delta variant and potential inflationary pressures. \n\nYesterday, The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June’s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nCore CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June’s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June’s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it’s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It’s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. \n\nThe US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, “This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you’ve been asking for for a long, long time.” Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared “100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration” said of the deal, “I was proud to support today’s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.” The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre.
