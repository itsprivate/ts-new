It is ARK's ninth ETF, and begins trading Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\n\"ARK believes transparent companies have less friction which could lead to exponential growth opportunities,\" the company wrote in an investment factsheet.\n\nThe Transparency Index's top five holdings as of Oct. 31 include Cloudflare ( NET) , Bloom Energy (BE), Enphase Energy (ENPH) , Tesla ( TSLA) and Spotify ( SPOT) , according to ARK.\n\nWood became a high-profile manager after her innovation-focused portfolios surged in 2020, with the investment firm's flagship ETF, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), delivering a 153% return that year. She became especially well-known for her bullish call on Tesla -- a call she has since reiterated, saying she believed the stock could reach $3,000 by 2025.\n\nThe investment products have since struggled to outpace last year's gains, trading mostly sideways in 2021. The Innovation ETF is down nearly 25% this year, and the worst performer -- the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) -- down 31%.\n\nOnly two of ARK's ETFs have risen year-to-date -- the Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL) and the ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ).\n\nJust like most ppl on this sub back in 2020 I was a big ARK bull, but after seeing how they've performing since Feb '21, I've sold off all my ARK funds. I personally won't be investing in this new ETF, what about you?",
