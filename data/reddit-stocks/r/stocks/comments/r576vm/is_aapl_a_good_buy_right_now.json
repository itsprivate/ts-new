If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.\n\nFirst let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**.\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$99 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$94 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith Apple´s price being at **$160** **per share** right now, it´s a little too high. That´s why I don´t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$293 per share** which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That´s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.\n\n**What I´ll do.** I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don´t double in 5 years, I´m rather bullish on this company.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",
