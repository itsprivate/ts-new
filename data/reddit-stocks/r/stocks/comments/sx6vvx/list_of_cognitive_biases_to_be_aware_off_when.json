The more you know, the less confident you are. You see this with seasoned investors vs newbies all the time.\n* **Google effect (aka Digital Amnesia**): We tend to forget information that’s easily looked up in search engines. *haha*\n* **Belief Bias:** We judge an argument’s strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how plausible the conclusion is in our own minds. Just remember its very easy to convince yourself.\n* **Declinism**: We tend to romanticize the past and view the future negatively, believing that societies/institutions are, by and large, in decline. Just look at the current sentiment here when market drops.\n* **Confirmation Bias**: oh look this post is exactly what I was thinking it must be right\n* **Falsification bias** is the opposite of confirmation bias. Oh look this article must be shit because it saying something bad about (XXX) pick your favorite industry / stock .\n* **Sunk Cost Fallacy (aka Escalation of Commitment)**: We invest more in things that have cost us something rather than altering our investments, even if we face negative outcomes. T*his one is by far one the most dangerous fallacy when it comes to investing.*\n* **Gambler’s Fallacy**: We think future possibilities are affected by past events. *Technical analysis anyone?*\n* **Framing Effect**: We often draw different conclusions from the same information depending on how it’s presented*. Or even who is saying it.* \n* **Out-Group Homogeneity Bias**: We perceive out-group members as homogeneous and our own in-groups as more diverse. So this is interesting in the context of reddit because often we keep thinking how diverse a sub is when in fact its an echo chamber that can amplify something that is completely wrong.\n* **Survivorship bias**: We tend to focus on those things that survived a process and overlook ones that failed. *Again vey dangerous when analyzing the market.*\n* **IKEA Effect**: We place higher value on things we have partially created ourselves. Again, its easy to get obsessed over a stock you were in early on.\n\nsource: [https://www.titlemax.com/discovery-center/lifestyle/50-cognitive-biases-to-be-aware-of-so-you-can-be-the-very-best-version-of-you/](https://www.titlemax.com/discovery-center/lifestyle/50-cognitive-biases-to-be-aware-of-so-you-can-be-the-very-best-version-of-you/)",
