Each of the major indexes gained more than 2% today after suffering one of the worst weeks since October. </p>\n\n<p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete [economic] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. </p>\n\n<p>Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s\">The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine </a>and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March.</p>\n\n<p>In Washington DC, over the weekend, the House of Representatives advanced the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package without any Republican support. The bill includes an additional payment of $1,400 to Americans, $400 per week in augmented Federal unemployment benefits, and $350 billion in State, local, and tribal aid. The bill now heads to the Senate, with lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before the mid-March deadline when current Federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. </p>\n\n<p>The Democrats are employing a process called reconciliation in order to get the stimulus bill passed without Republican support. Through reconciliation, Congress can enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. As a reminder, there is a 50/50 split in the Senate, but Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Vice-President, has the power to break a tie. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>NIO is set to report earnings after the bell, this is one we are closely watching</li>\n<li>Two new space stocks, Spire Global and Vector are set to join the market via merger. Space stocks have been very hot recently and Cathie Woods of ARK Investments is planning to release a space-themed ETF soon.</li>\n<li>Construction spending increased by 1.7% to $1.521 trillion, according to the Commerce Department&#39;s monthly report for January, with that level marking the greatest since the start of the government series in 2002. </li>\n<li>After pulling back along with the broader market, Bitcoin (BTC) went from low $43,000 to over $48,000 now. </li>\n<li>Facebook (FB) signed up a string of German media partners on Monday to provide content for a local news product, but the publisher of the country&#39;s best-selling newspaper said it would not take part on terms it dismissed as derisory. After the recent situation in Australia, Facebook now has to sign new publishers for its platform.</li>\n<li>Nio is planning to start exporting to Europe in the second half of 2021, CEO William Li said during a web conference, <a href=\"https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/\">cnEV Post </a>reported, citing automotive media outlet Bitauto.com.</li>\n<li>Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) target raised by Barclays from $113 to $140 at Overweight.
