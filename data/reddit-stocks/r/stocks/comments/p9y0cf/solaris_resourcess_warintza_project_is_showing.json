  "selftext": "Anglo American’s ([LN:AAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL.L)) Quellaveco copper project is located 34km east of Moquegua in southern Peru, with an estimated investment of up to $5.3bn. Its open-pit mining venture on one of the world’s biggest undeveloped single porphyry copper deposits has a reserve base of more than 1.3 billion tonnes. The porphyry belt it is located also hosts Southern Copper’s Cuajone and Toquepala mines.\n\nRight now the Quellaveco copper mine was estimated to hold 898 million tonnes (Mt) of proven ore reserves, grading 0.58% of copper and containing 5,209 kilo tonne (Kt) of copper, as of December 2017. Their probable ore reserves were estimated to be 435Mt grading 0.54% of copper and containing 2.35Mt of copper.\n\nOn the other hand, Solaris Resources ([TSX:SLS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/)) is a smaller player in the industry that has the Warintza copper project located in southeastern Ecuador under its belt. This project is adjacent to the national highway that runs north-south along a mineral belt that hosts Lundin Gold‘s (TSX: LUG) Fruta del Norte mine and a Chinese consortium’s Mirador mine, about 40 km to the south.\n\nTheir [recent drilling](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solaris-reports-1-000m-0-110000567.html) at Warintza Central intersected 1,029 metres of 0.73% copper-equivalent from surface and 1,000 metres of 0.60% copper-equivalent, including 786 metres of 0.67% copper-equivalent from surface, extending the Warinzta Central strike length to 1,250 metres. With this, their priority is to deliver a billion-plus tonne resource at Central, and make additional discoveries adjacent and around that.\n\nWhat’s interesting about these two is the fact that while they are situated in different areas in South America, Peru and Ecuador share the same geology, and with Ecuador, even the little exploration that has happened so far has found some massive deposits. The area also has a supply of abundant fresh water, and has a grid supplied with clean, low-cost electric power and the ability to transport supplies via nearby highways connecting to Pacific ports and airports. Even though Anglo American’s project is still bigger, Solaris has so much potential especially if you consider their recent drilling results.\n\nSolaris also has a massive cash cushion and their cash burn is way under which is a good sign. They have about $60 million on the balance sheet right now and approximately $20 million needed for the remaining 2021 capex. There’s still plenty left in the tank and that's high value. With their good drill results and a hot commodity market, Solaris Resources definitely has more room to grow and has good potential to match Anglo American’s Quellaveco copper project.",
