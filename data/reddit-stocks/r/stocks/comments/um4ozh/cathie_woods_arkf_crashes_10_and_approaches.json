  "selftext": "Cathie Wood’s ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF) crashed 10.4% during Monday’s general sell-off, sending the exchange traded fund near its record trading low.\n\nARKF closed trading at 17.67 -- a 26-month trading low. The last time the fintech ETF traded this low was when the fund touched 16.94 a share during its 2020 COVID low dating back to Mar. 18, 2020.\n\nARKF now trades just 0.73 cents above its record low.\n\nDragging down ARKF has been the crashing price of its top three holdings Block (SQ), Shopify (SHOP), and Coinbase Global (COIN). The three stocks together represent nearly a third of ARKF (29.46% to be exact), led by SQ at 11.72%, SHOP at 8.92% and COIN weighted at 8.92%.\n\nIn terms of the individual stocks, SQ closed out the day -12.8% and the stock touched a 52-week trading low. Year-to-date SQ is -48.4%.\n\nSHOP concluded the session lower by 9.9% and has been absolutely crushed all year as the stock is -75.7% in 2022.\n\nCOIN sunk like a stone as the crypto exchange platform lost 35.8% over the last three trading days, losing 19.5% alone on Monday. Bigger picture, COIN is lower by 67.4% YTD and closed at a record low.\n\nARKF currently finds itself down 72.6% from its record high of 64.49 a share which it experienced on Feb. 16, 2021. In 2022, ARKF has underperformed, with the ETF down 57%.",
