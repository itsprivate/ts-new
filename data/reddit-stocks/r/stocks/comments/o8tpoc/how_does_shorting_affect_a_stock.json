There's a reason why the most shorted companies are some of the most controversial ones.

If a company was that good that it only needs money to become an amazing performer, there surely would be some merry bunch of individuals who would give them some. I mean, investors and institutions are spending a fuckton of money supporting companies with a 10% chance of surviving over the next few years and dodgy startups, if they saw a company that only needs cash to perform well, they'd surely recognise the opportunity, right?\n\nI have not actually done any substantial factual research on this although admittedly it's a bit hard to find good resources right now which are not biased. This is purely my own personal understanding. There's plenty of people here who are smarter than me so I was hoping that somebody would have a good answer 😁\n\nThanks!",
