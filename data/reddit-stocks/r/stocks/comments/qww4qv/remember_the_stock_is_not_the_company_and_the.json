As someone greatly explained it to me,   \n\n***The problem is that with shorts you are not betting that the stocks is undervalued, you are betting that people will realize within a short span of time that it is overvalued which is more risky than the former.***\n\nAnyways, I been seeing and hearing lately a lot of people looking for long-term investments during 2021. Don't mean to be a bear, but it's important to understand that the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock.\n\nThere are plenty of companies out there going mainstream with potential for a bright future. EV sector, Renewable sector, Crypto, Fintech & Tech, etc. \n\nI agree. I firmly believe renewables, electric vehicles, and internet-based payments are, in fact, the future. EV vehicle sales are growing at exponential paces. Solar panels will be seen more and more in your neighborhoods. ATMs probably won't even exist in 2030. Major cities are pushing for 100% electric buses by 2035. Major car dealerships are expecting to sell only EVs by 2040. Crypto is making a push as well.\n\nBut what's important is also hopping in the stock at the right price. Now, I'm not advocating for market timing. But hopping into Rivian, whose currently valued at $100B with 0 sales is just insane. Lucid being another one whose valued at $75B with a QUARTER of a MILLION in sales. Don't even get me started on $PLUG. $PLUG is a leader in hydrogen fuel cells for forklifts that reported negative revenue (wtf) and is valued $23B. We all know Tesla is a leader in its sector as well, but the price is outrageous. History has shown prices will always correct based on the company's fundamentals. Too many posts on $TSLA so I won't go into this. \n\nIt's no doubt we are in a bubble. Lots of \"Stock Gurus\" on Instagram promoting all these overvalued stocks just because their \"future looks bright\", and here come all these people commenting talking about how they just invested for the long term. Not saying their future isn't bright, but it's important to know when a stock is reasonably priced as opposed to just hearing a pitch line and going all in if they convince you. \n\nI have no ounce of doubt the prices will drop substantially. I'm not worried about missing out on these hyped stocks. And no, I'm not talking about a 30% correction. Check the dot com bubble companies. I'm talking 95% corrections. Several bankruptcies across the globe. \n\n ***The 2000 dot-com market collapse was triggered by technology stocks. Investors' interest in internet related companies increased to a frenzied level following massive growth and adoption of the internet.*** \n\n***It was the unprecedented rise in equity valuations of internet-based tech companies during the bull market of the late 1990s*** \n\n***The dotcom bubble burst when capital began to dry up. In the years preceding the bubble, record low interest rates, the adoption of the Internet, and interest in technology companies allowed capital to flow freely, especially to startup companies that had no track record of success.*** \n\nI'm not here to spark rage or scare you. It's just the hard truth, lots of inexperienced investors have no idea how crazy the outcome could get. Once the big banks and heads at Wall Street realize its insanely overvalued, the rug pull will come. \n\nLet me know if I'm wrong. Curious to hear everyone's thoughts.",
