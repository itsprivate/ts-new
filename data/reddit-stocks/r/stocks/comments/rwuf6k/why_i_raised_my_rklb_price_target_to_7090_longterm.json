I really think that is possible given how the value premium attached to a successful launch track record is shaping up now and that Rocket Lab is diversifying into other aspects of space and not just launch. \n\n$30-$40 billion is still going to be a fraction of what SpaceX (valued at $100 billion privately and likely would be $150 billion to $200 billion if they were public) already is right now. And yes SpaceX has Starlink, but they won’t be allowed to have a monopoly and RKLB will serve customers that are competitors to Starlink at the very least even if they don’t do their own internet service. There’s so many possibilities here and they have plenty of capital and sources of funding to work with already.\n\nHaving early mover advantage is huge in the space sector and they’re in as good a position as possible to benefit from this and expand their capital base and operations. Neutron, the new launchpad in the eastern US, and the expansion into satellite systems will be huge factors. This might take years to play out but I don’t mind being even more patient and potentially paying the lower long term capital gains rate on profits if it works out. So RKLB to $70 is my new PT!!! It’s an investment, not a trade! (Not financial advice, just my opinion)",
