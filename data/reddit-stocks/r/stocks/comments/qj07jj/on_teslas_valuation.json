  "selftext": "Tesla's valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like \"Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined\" or \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.\n\nThat said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla's market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla's trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.\n\n**For those who don't like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to \"The Numbers\"**\n\n----------------------------\n\n**The method**\n\nWhile trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**The trends**\n\nIn terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.\n\nIn terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.\n\nIn terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**The future**\n\nObviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.\n\nThat said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.\n\nIn terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**The numbers**\n\nPutting all of the information from the previous section together, I have create a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024. In the worst case I assume there are significant unforeseen setbacks that cause them to fall short of those numbers, in the best case I expect them to meet or even slightly exceed them. This brings us to the following projection:\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|\n|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|\n|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nWhile I mentioned ASPs will likely increase, I have chosen to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 because it's too difficult to predict. This should make sure the final numbers remain conservative.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$70B|$85B|\n|**2023**|$100B|$135B|\n|**2024**|$130B|$165B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nBecause of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|14%|14%|\n|**2023**|15%|18%|\n|**2024**|16%|20%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$9,8B|$11,9B|\n|**2023**|$15,0B|$24,3B|\n|**2024**|$20,8B|$33,0B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|102|84|\n|**2023**|67|41|\n|**2024**|48|30|\n\n---------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nShould Tesla trade flat at around a $1T market cap and they continue on their current trajectory, they will be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Depending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock has between 1 and 3 years of growth priced in.\n\nSo to conclude, the popular sentiment that \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" is false.\n\n**Important side note**\n\nFor simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid \"FSD doesn't exist\" and \"energy is a scam\" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.\n\n**TL;DR: Based on Tesla's current trends, they have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.**",
