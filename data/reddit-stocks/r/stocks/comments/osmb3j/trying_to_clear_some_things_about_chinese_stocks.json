I also feel that there’s plenty of people who are maybe uncertain about a specific thing surrounding this topic, so I’ve decided to give it a shot and clear a few things about the drama around Alibaba and the other chinese stocks.\n\nSo this year as many of you know, the chinese stocks have taken a serious beating this year:\n\nBABA - Down 40% from ATHs\n\nTencent - Down 40% from ATHs\n\nJD - Down 39% from ATHs\n\nBIDU - Down 50% from ATHs\n\nNIO - Down 30% from ATHs\n\nDIDI - Down 51% from ATHs\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\nChinese stocks have fallen for numerous reasons. There’s regulatory challenges and political risks resulting to fears of delisting, and of course the risks with ADRs. I’ll go through these a little more, and then tell some positives and opportunities \nabout this situation.\n\n**Regulatory challenges**\n\nAll of the chinese companies are under heavy preassure from the CCP. There’s been anti-monopoly regulators [fining](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/china-regulators-fine-alibaba-275-bln-anti-monopoly-violations-2021-04-10/) Alibaba with a fine of $2.8B and fining Tencent also for acquiring companies that would increase its market power. [DiDi](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57938212) has seen Chinese regulator interest over how they collect user data. The government is already preparing a fine for the company. Among these cases, there will probably be many future fines to be handed which leaves all the companies under jeopardy.\n\n**Tensions between the US and the Chinese government and the possibility of delisting**\n\nThe US passed the legislation late last year requiring foreign companies that went public in the US to allow audit inspections in the next three years. The Chinese government on the other hand, wants that Chinese companies would trade at their own exchanges and probably won’t give permission to inspect the companies. This could lead to the delisting of some stocks, and everyone who put money in the companies would be left out with nothing.\n\n\n**ADRs**\n\nAs many of you know, the Chinese companies that are listed in the US exchange aren’t actual shares of the companies. They are [American depositary receipts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp). ADR’s job is essentially to mimic price movement of the stock that trades in a place that isn’t accessible for US stock market. While ADRs are good for the people who want to invest somewhere they couldn’t, they come with MASSIVE cons for the investor. \n\nTake Alibaba as an example: The ADR which trades at the NYSE is actually just a holding company in the Cayman Islands. It isn’t the actual Alibaba which trades at the Hong Kong exchange. With this, you don’t hold a right to vote in the Annual meeting of the shareholders and if something bad were to happen, you could maybe even lose all your money. And this is the case for every Chinese stock whether it’s Tencent or NIO.\n\n**The opportunity** \n\nOk, now we’ve gone through the main problems with Chinese stocks. There are some that I didn’t go through, but I think these would be the ones that are the most serious. With everything this going on, this creates an opportunity to snatch these companies on heavy discounts, if you’re willing to take the gamble. \n\nBut maybe if you’d give it a little bit of time and see how this pans out and maybe some of the worst risks would go out like the delisting risk, you could take a conservative position. This isn’t financial advice, I don’t hold any Chinese stocks at the moment. I only explained an opportunity. China is showing huge growth with the emerging middle class who are ready to spend. This is big for companies like BABA who are trading at 16x earnings and under book value. \n\nThis was just a post to try to clear all the surrounding uncertainty. I gathered everything I have learned from this topic, but please fill some spots I missed. Hopefully I managed to help someone who didn’t know as much as before.",
