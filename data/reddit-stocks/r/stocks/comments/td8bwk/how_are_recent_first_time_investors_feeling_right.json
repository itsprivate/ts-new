I kept enough in my savings to be okay for 6 months if I needed it. \n\nI’m investing for the long term, not trading. But Currently, I’m feeling really sad about my timing.\n\nIm aware that I didn’t really know what I was doing and ignored a lot of the market signals I’ve since learned more about the hard way. But I thought I was making smart investments overall. \n\nIt’s really hard seeing myself down 60k just a couple months after starting to invest for the first time - also feeling really hard on myself for not knowing better to hold off and have all those funds in my savings available for a time like today.\n\nHoping to continue DCA throughout the rest of my career now that I dove into head first…just hoping I’ll look back at the end and not still be bummed about this current phase.\n\n**Thanks everyone for your input and perspective so far. Whether you’re new like me, or someone with experience - if you share your thoughts, I will read them 👀👀**",
