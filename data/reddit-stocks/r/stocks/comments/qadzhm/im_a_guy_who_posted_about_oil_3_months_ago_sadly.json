I'm not all out of the trade at all, but I'm playing ETFs and 2 individual stocks (Exxon, Devon.)\n\nI think that oil may still go up in the near term towards winter, and I believe even the medium term oil looks good. But I still think at these prices, we should not be entering any new trades with money we aren't prepared to lose. I've traded oil quite a bit the passed year, and I've gotten saved by my own conviction. If you plan on trading commodities, I recommend a level head and sound due diligence. \n\nAgain, being early is no different from being wrong. I was right, but my options thought I wasn't, and I saw a -50%. That was scary, but I still knew that the fundamentals of this oil rally would unltimately bring prices up. Looking at wti go from 80 to 68, was gut wrenching, and holding my January calls through it was almost stupid, but conviction and experience and knowledge of this painful trade is what ended up making me my money back on it. \n\nIf you are a trader of commodities, be careful. Even though I made my money back, I'm not sure if it was worth the receding hairline. \n\nThat being said, oil was a great trade, and I'm happy I was in it.",
