I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 11th, 2022.\n\n# **Big banks’ earnings and a hot inflation report could sway markets in short holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/big-banks-earnings-and-a-hot-inflation-report-could-sway-markets-in-short-holiday-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face what could be a hot inflation report in the week ahead and a batch of big bank earnings to start the earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock kick off the financial industry’s first-quarter earnings releases Wednesday, with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reporting Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The war in Ukraine will remain a focus, as investors look for any signs of change in the crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the first-quarter earnings reports from the financial sector will be important to a market considering the impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and aggressively tighten policy.\n*****\n&gt; “We want to get a picture of how do they see the Fed’s plan... quantitative tightening, the liquidity drain, coupled with higher rates, affecting their clients and their business units,” said Krosby. “If you look at the XLF [Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF], on days it goes up, it’s the insurance companies because they’re raising premiums. Higher rates are good for banks, until, the belief is, the higher rates are going to hurt the economy.”\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, but the interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was down 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500 was off 1.3%. For a third week in a month, the jump in the 10-year Treasury yield topped 30 basis points, according to Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. A basis point equals 0.01%.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year rose above 2.7% on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s been on jet fuel,” said Schumacher. He said the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, got a boost in the past week from the Fed’s signal that it is planning to trim its balance sheet by $95 billion a month, of which about $60 billion will be in Treasurys.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important as a benchmark and also because it is a rate that affects mortgages and other loans.\n*****\n&gt; “People are saying the balance sheet is going to cause the 10s to move quite a bit,” said Schumacher. He said he could not rule out a move in the yield to 3%, given the speed at which the yield has moved recently.\n*****\n&gt; Economic data in the coming week could be a catalyst for another move higher.\n*****\n&gt; The four-day holiday week is packed with economic reports. Some will be released on the Good Friday market holiday. The highlight is Tuesday’s report of March’s consumer price index, which is expected to top the 7.9% reported for February.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s big. It’s the last key data point before the Fed meets May 3,” said Schumacher. A hot number, even in line with expectations, will encourage the market to expect a 50-basis-point hike, or a half percent, from the Fed at that meeting. The Fed began its rate hiking cycle in March with a quarter-point increase.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index is set for release on Wednesday. Data on retail sales and consumer sentiment are due Thursday. On the Friday market holiday, Empire state manufacturing and industrial production are released.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays economists expect CPI rose 1.24% in March, gaining a stunning 8.5% year-over-year, the highest in 40 years. “We expect the annual rate of CPI to peak in March and move lower thereon, aided by positive base effects,” the economists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator is released April 29, but CPI and PPI will both set the tone for that report.\n*****\n&gt; “We’ve had such a sharp move in yields. Sentiment is so dour in rates, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got a relief rally in rates after we see the March CPI,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; “While inflation pressures are still going to be here, I think March would be the peak inflation rate on a rate of change basis... You could get some rotation [in stocks] next week if you get a bond bounce,” said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said the bond market will also be watching the Bank of Canada for an expected rate hike when it meets Wednesday, and the European Central Bank for comments on its bond purchases at its Thursday meeting.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season\nAccording to Refinitiv, S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1% in the first quarter, but the financial sector is expected to see a decline of 22.9%.\n*****\n&gt; LPL’s Krosby expects to see choppy trading. “I think it’s going to be a difficult quarter,” she said. She said investors will be watching to see how the market absorbs a 50-basis-point hike. Quantitative tightening, balance sheet reductions known as QT, is also a policy tightening.\n*****\n&gt; “The QT could start next month. There’s a sense [the Fed] can’t wait any longer,” she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said she recommends a defensive focus, favoring consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and health care, as well as consumer discretionary names that emphasize cost savings for consumers.\n\n&gt; “I suspect at the end of next week, with the long weekend ahead, people will want to cut risk, but I suspect it could be a pretty rocky ride with CPI before we see that,” said Schumacher.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/vYFQXkL.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/nVARdIi.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9RKdvjO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/KIrJOLd.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/2OHj17M.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Q1CXeDl.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aZ1O37g.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EPcA7LP.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oZhS3vC.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaondpp.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NJRRRh4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aVch5I7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/USakzyJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Treasuries Yields Blow Past Dividend Yields\n\n&gt; US Treasury yields have experienced a dramatic move higher as the market prices in continued rate hikes in the near future. With the increase in long-term Treasury yields, we're starting to see what looks like the end of a period where the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury fought back and forth over which asset class had a more attractive yield.\n\n&gt; As shown in the chart below, from 1970 right up to the period before the global financial crisis, the 10-year yield consistently yielded more than the S&amp;P 500. As the Fed cut rates to zero during the crisis, though, the S&amp;P 500 went on to see multiple periods where its dividend yield was in excess of the 10-year Treasury yield. With the recent surge in yields as the Fed embarks on what the market expects to be an aggressive rate hiking cycle, the script has been completely flipped. The 10-year now offers a roughly 125 bps higher yield than the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield which is the widest spread since the fall of 2018 and before that, the fall of 2011. As the spread between the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasury yield hits the low end of the GFC/post-GFC era, we would note that current levels are still roughly 200 bps higher than the historical average going back to 1970.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-SPX-10-y-Spread-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bulls Head for the Hills Once Again\n\n&gt; After peaking at 32.8% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment continues to roll over as the S&amp;P 500 has erased some of the March gains this week. After this week's decline of 7.2 percentage points in bullish sentiment, less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. While low, that is still a few percentage points above the weaker levels from February.\n\n&gt; ###### **([https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png))**\n\n&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn rose 13.9 percentage points which was the biggest one-week uptick since August 2019 when it rose 24.14 percentage points. At 41.4%, bearish sentiment is now at the highest level since the week of March 17th. That is an elevated reading and a big move week over week, but it is also well off recent highs from the past few months that were more than 10 percentage points higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bears.png))**\n\n&gt; The bull-bear spread tipped into positive territory for the first time in 2022 last week, but the big inverse moves between bulls and bears erased much of the past few weeks' move. The spread is down to -16.7 which is still 13.6 points above the late February low of -30.3.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; The big pickup in the number of respondents reporting as bearish didn't entirely come from the bullish camp. Neutral sentiment also shed a significant amount falling from 40.6% last week to 33.9%. That is essentially mean reversion as neutral sentiment now sits only a couple of points above the historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n***** \n\n&gt; # Near Record Low in Jobless Claims\n\n&gt; This week's jobless claims release was significant in a couple of ways. For starters, the Department of Labor revised seasonal adjustment factors (more on that below) and second, the most recent print for the seasonally adjusted number hit one of the lowest levels on record. Claims came in at 166K which tied the number from two weeks ago (after revisions) for the second-lowest reading on record behind the week of 11/29/68. That week's reading was only 4K lower.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; As for continuing claims, this week's reading was higher rising from 1.506 million to 1.523 million. Having come off last week's low, that remains one of the strongest levels since 1970.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting back to initial claims, while adjusted claims are at multi-decade lows, non-seasonally adjusted claims are very healthy but not quite at a record. At current levels of 193.1K, the only year with a lower reading for the comparable week of the year was 1969 (170K) but at the seasonal lows in the few years prior to the pandemic, claims were even stronger than they are now. So while unadjusted claims are strong, the seasonally adjusted number was even more eyecatching this week.\n\n&gt; As for why the seasonally adjusted number appears so much stronger, as shown in the second chart below, the current week of the year has historically been the second most consistent week of the year in seeing a week-over-week increase in claims. As a period with consistent seasonal headwinds, the seasonal adjustment would control for this by depressing the level of claims by a relatively strong seasonal factor. That usual increase was not seen this year as NSA claims were actually slightly lower falling from 196.8K to 193.1K. That means seasonal adjustment helped out what was already a strong number.\n\n&gt; Additionally worth noting this week is the DOL changed its seasonal adjustment methodology. The DOL fully describes the change in this week's release and links to further reading on the topic for those interested in going deeper into the weeds, but to briefly summarize: periods when the level of an economic indicator experiences historic shifts in levels as claims did in 2020 and 2021, multiplicative adjustment (which has been used in \"normal times\" like prior to the pandemic and from here forward) would tend to over or understate adjusted claims. Additive adjustment, on the other hand, is less affected by the actual level of the indicator meaning it would lead to more accurate approximations of seasonally adjusted numbers in times of sudden spikes in the series. This methodology has been used throughout the pandemic period. Now that claims have more or less returned to a more normal range of readings, the DOL sees it justifiable to switch the seasonal adjustment methodology back to multiplicative. While that does not mean too much for interpreting claims, that change in methodology has led to some large downward revisions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 10 Things To Know About Inverted Yield Curves\n\n&gt; One of the biggest stories over the past few weeks has been the inversion of various points on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The more well-known 2-year/10-year yield curve spread inverted on April 1, 2022 for the first time since 2019, while the 5-year/30-year inverted for the first time since 2006 on March 28.\n\n&gt; What is a yield curve? The yield curve plots the yield of different maturity bonds, usually Treasuries. In normal times, a longer dated bond should have a higher yield than a shorter dated bond. Historically, after key parts of the yield curve invert, the economy eventually has moved into a recession. This is why these signals are quiet important.\n\n&gt; Here are ten things to know about the yield curve.\n\n&gt; * Yes, past recessions have been proceeded by an inverted yield curve, but by no means does it happen right away. Another way to put it is yield curve inversions have preceded all recessions, but not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession. Historically, when the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverts, a recession has taken place an average about 19 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.5.22.png))**\n\n&gt; * What about stocks? “One of the bigger surprises for investors is that stocks historically have actually done quite well after previous inversions,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained another 29% on average and peaked nearly 17 months later after the previous four inversions.” The bottom line is a yield curve inversion is a warning sign, but by no means does that mean trouble is coming immediately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.5.22.png))**\n\n&gt; * In the LPL Research Chart of the Day (shown below), here is how the S&amp;P 500 has done after all the 2-year/10-year inversions going back to the mid-1960s. Once again, some of the more recent performance has been quite impressive.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-3-4.5.22.png))**\n\n&gt; * One thing investors seem to be ignoring lately though is the short-end of the curve. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) came out recently saying as much in Don’t Fear the Yield Curve. They concluded that the 2-year/10-year yield curve wasn’t a good indicator for recessions; instead the near-term spread between the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has been much better. Take note that the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has steepened significantly the past few months, reducing the chances of a recession. Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Powell said last month that the economy was on firm footing and would be able to withstand rate hikes. In other words, the Fed isn’t worried about a recession quite yet.\n\n&gt; * Along these lines, the 3-month/10-year yield curve recently was at its steepest level in 5 years! This has been our personal favorite part of the yield curve to use as a signal for a pending recession (as the 2-year/10-year has given false signals before) and if and until this curve inverts, we believe the odds of a recession on the horizon is limited.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4-4.5.22.png))**\n\n&gt; * Yield curves are one part of the bond market, but what the credit markets are saying is another (think of them as bond investors take on financial conditions) and we see a much different opinion here. Lately, high yield bonds have outperformed Treasuries ( Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield index and the Bloomberg US Treasury index), a clue the credit markets weren’t very worried about economic growth going forward. In the past, trouble starts brewing when high yield underperforms Treasuries.\n\n&gt; * Adding to this, spreads on high yield and investment grade corporates have both come back significantly the past few weeks. “To see credit markets showing major signs of improvement the past few weeks is a great sign that financial conditions are probably better than most think,” explained Detrick. “Yes, the yield curve is flashing some warnings, but overall the credit markets are saying don’t get overly worried just yet.”\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-5-4.5.22.png))**\n\n&gt; * Real rates (rates adjusted for inflation) are negative. With the 10-year breakeven rate, what the bond market thinks inflation will average over the next 10 years, currently near 2.8% and the 10-year Treasury yield currently near 2.5%, real yields are actually negative. Historically, negative real rates have been quite bullish for risk assets. The Roaring 1920s, then during the 1940s and 1950s, were the last time we saw an extended period of negative real rates. As history told us, those decades saw explosive growth and stock market gains.\n\n&gt; * Real yield curves (adjusted for inflation) are still upwardly sloping. Take note, we’ve seen real yields invert ahead of recessions in the past along with nominal yield curves (2006 and 2019 most recently), yet another clue a recession might not be as close as some fear. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs noted that nominal curves tend to invert more easily in high inflation environments (we can check this box now), suggesting it would take a deeper inversion than recent cycles to trigger a recession signal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-6-4.5.22.png))**\n\n&gt; * Lastly, the Fed owns nearly $9 trillion in bonds and 25% of the entire Treasury market. Who knows where yields would be if they didn’t own any, but most agree longer-term yields would likely be much higher. So maybe various yield curves wouldn’t be inverted or even that close to inverting? This concept is mere conjecture, but it is a note we’ve seen lately that is at least worth pointing out.\n\n&gt; There is a lot to digest here and this isn’t an easy subject, but the bottom line is the takeaway isn’t as simple as an inverted yield curve means a recession is imminent.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What the Yield Curve Is, and Isn’t, Signaling… Yet\n\n&gt; The shape of U.S Treasury yield curve is often looked at as a barometer for U.S. economic growth. More specifically, it reflects how the Federal Reserve (Fed) intends to stimulate or slow economic growth by cutting or raising its policy rate. Each tenor on the curve is roughly the expected policy rate plus or minus a term premium (the term premium represents the expected compensation for lending for longer periods of time). In “normal” times, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning longer maturity Treasury yields are higher than shorter maturity Treasury yields. However, when the economy is growing too quickly, inflationary pressures are apparent, and the Fed wants to slow growth, shorter maturity securities could eventually out-yield longer maturity securities, inverting the yield curve.\n\n&gt; “Yield curve inversion is likely going to be the phrase of the year in 2022,” noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. “However, we don’t think recession is in the cards for this year. If the Fed follows through with the expected rate hikes however—a big if—we’re likely going to see the 3 month/ 10 year close to inversion by the end of the year, which would likely mean recession could be a 2023/2024 event.”\n\n&gt; When we look at the yield curve currently, we see two different signals. As seen on the LPL Chart of the Day, the 2-year yield is currently out-yielding the 10-year Treasury yield and is thus inverted. However, when we look at shorter maturities, such as the difference between the 3-month Treasury yield and the 10-year Treasury yield, the curve is still very steep, which makes sense since the Fed has only raised interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) this year. The difference in the 2-year Treasury yield and the 10-year Treasury yield measures market expectations of what the Fed may do—not what it has already done. Using shorter parts of the yield curve, which is what the academic research supports, measures what the Fed has already done and may be a better indicator of near-term recession risks. Fed rate hikes are used to slow economic growth so it’s the reality of these hikes that leads the economy to contract—not the threat of rate hikes.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-4.5.22-.png))**\n\n&gt; The past six times the 2Y/10Y part of the yield curve inverted, a recession followed, on average, 18 months later. However, the length of time between the quickest time to recession (6 months) and the longest time until recession (nearly 36 months!) complicates the signal and in the Fed’s words, the relationship is probably spurious. Additionally, the signal may not be as robust as it once was as central banks around the world have implemented aggressive quantitative easing programs that have likely impacted market signals. In the U.S., for example, the Fed owns more than 25% of Treasury securities outstanding and continues to reinvest coupon and principal payments into the Treasury market.\n\n&gt; That said, we don’t think investors should ignore the 2Y/10Y signal altogether. We acknowledge that given the nuances surrounding current economic dynamics and with the Fed likely to respond more aggressively than previous rate hiking campaigns to arrest stubbornly high consumer price increases, recessionary risks have likely been pulled forward into 2023/2024. That said, we still expect the economy to grow above trend this year given underlying consumer strength.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # April’s Stellar Track Record\n\n&gt; April has been nearly perfect with gains steadily building from the first trading day to the last with only the occasional and minor blip along the way. DJIA has been up 16 Aprils in a row with an average gain of 2.9%. S&amp;P 500 has been up 15 of the last 16 Aprils with an average gain of 3.1%\n\n&gt; April is last month of the Best Six Months November-April and when we begin tracking our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could keep the current rally intact.\n\n&gt; April got off to its usual stellar start the first two trading days of the month, but some surprisingly hawkish remarks from the usually dovish Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard has stocks on the ropes today.\n\n&gt; Barring any major escalation in Ukraine, we suspect the market to log additional gains in April as the Best Six Months come to a close and then move sideways during much of Q2 and Q3. Likely testing the lows before rallying in Q4 and into 2023.\n\n&gt; Our “Best Six Months” switching strategy found in our annual Stock Trader’s Almanac which is basically the flipside of the old “sell in May and Go Away” adage. After decades of historical research, we discovered that most market gains occur during the months November through April.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 11th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big banks’ earnings and a hot inflation report could sway markets in short holiday week - &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/big-banks-earnings-and-a-hot-inflation-report-could-sway-markets-in-short-holiday-week.html\"&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Markets face what could be a hot inflation report in the week ahead and a batch of big bank earnings to start the earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock kick off the financial industry’s first-quarter earnings releases Wednesday, with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reporting Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine will remain a focus, as investors look for any signs of change in the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the first-quarter earnings reports from the financial sector will be important to a market considering the impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and aggressively tighten policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We want to get a picture of how do they see the Fed’s plan... quantitative tightening, the liquidity drain, coupled with higher rates, affecting their clients and their business units,” said Krosby. “If you look at the XLF [Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF], on days it goes up, it’s the insurance companies because they’re raising premiums. Higher rates are good for banks, until, the belief is, the higher rates are going to hurt the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, but the interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was down 3.9% and the S&amp;amp;P 500 was off 1.3%. For a third week in a month, the jump in the 10-year Treasury yield topped 30 basis points, according to Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. A basis point equals 0.01%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 10-year rose above 2.7% on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s been on jet fuel,” said Schumacher. He said the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, got a boost in the past week from the Fed’s signal that it is planning to trim its balance sheet by $95 billion a month, of which about $60 billion will be in Treasurys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 10-year is important as a benchmark and also because it is a rate that affects mortgages and other loans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“People are saying the balance sheet is going to cause the 10s to move quite a bit,” said Schumacher. He said he could not rule out a move in the yield to 3%, given the speed at which the yield has moved recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Economic data in the coming week could be a catalyst for another move higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The four-day holiday week is packed with economic reports. Some will be released on the Good Friday market holiday. The highlight is Tuesday’s report of March’s consumer price index, which is expected to top the 7.9% reported for February.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s big. It’s the last key data point before the Fed meets May 3,” said Schumacher. A hot number, even in line with expectations, will encourage the market to expect a 50-basis-point hike, or a half percent, from the Fed at that meeting. The Fed began its rate hiking cycle in March with a quarter-point increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The producer price index is set for release on Wednesday. Data on retail sales and consumer sentiment are due Thursday. On the Friday market holiday, Empire state manufacturing and industrial production are released.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barclays economists expect CPI rose 1.24% in March, gaining a stunning 8.5% year-over-year, the highest in 40 years. “We expect the annual rate of CPI to peak in March and move lower thereon, aided by positive base effects,” the economists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator is released April 29, but CPI and PPI will both set the tone for that report.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had such a sharp move in yields. Sentiment is so dour in rates, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got a relief rally in rates after we see the March CPI,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“While inflation pressures are still going to be here, I think March would be the peak inflation rate on a rate of change basis... You could get some rotation [in stocks] next week if you get a bond bounce,” said Boockvar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schumacher said the bond market will also be watching the Bank of Canada for an expected rate hike when it meets Wednesday, and the European Central Bank for comments on its bond purchases at its Thursday meeting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Earnings season&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Refinitiv, S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1% in the first quarter, but the financial sector is expected to see a decline of 22.9%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LPL’s Krosby expects to see choppy trading. “I think it’s going to be a difficult quarter,” she said. She said investors will be watching to see how the market absorbs a 50-basis-point hike. Quantitative tightening, balance sheet reductions known as QT, is also a policy tightening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The QT could start next month. There’s a sense [the Fed] can’t wait any longer,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Krosby said she recommends a defensive focus, favoring consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and health care, as well as consumer discretionary names that emphasize cost savings for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I suspect at the end of next week, with the long weekend ahead, people will want to cut risk, but I suspect it could be a pretty rocky ride with CPI before we see that,” said Schumacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vYFQXkL.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P Sectors for this past week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/nVARdIi.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices for this past week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/9RKdvjO.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Futures Markets as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/KIrJOLd.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/2OHj17M.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Q1CXeDl.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/aZ1O37g.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/EPcA7LP.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oZhS3vC.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the upcoming IPO&amp;#39;s for this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/uaondpp.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&amp;#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp;amp; Downgrades:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NJRRRh4.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/aVch5I7.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/USakzyJ.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Treasuries Yields Blow Past Dividend Yields&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;US Treasury yields have experienced a dramatic move higher as the market prices in continued rate hikes in the near future. With the increase in long-term Treasury yields, we&amp;#39;re starting to see what looks like the end of a period where the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury fought back and forth over which asset class had a more attractive yield.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As shown in the chart below, from 1970 right up to the period before the global financial crisis, the 10-year yield consistently yielded more than the S&amp;amp;P 500. As the Fed cut rates to zero during the crisis, though, the S&amp;amp;P 500 went on to see multiple periods where its dividend yield was in excess of the 10-year Treasury yield. With the recent surge in yields as the Fed embarks on what the market expects to be an aggressive rate hiking cycle, the script has been completely flipped. The 10-year now offers a roughly 125 bps higher yield than the S&amp;amp;P 500 dividend yield which is the widest spread since the fall of 2018 and before that, the fall of 2011. As the spread between the S&amp;amp;P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasury yield hits the low end of the GFC/post-GFC era, we would note that current levels are still roughly 200 bps higher than the historical average going back to 1970.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-SPX-10-y-Spread-2.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Bulls Head for the Hills Once Again&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After peaking at 32.8% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment continues to roll over as the S&amp;amp;P 500 has erased some of the March gains this week. After this week&amp;#39;s decline of 7.2 percentage points in bullish sentiment, less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. While low, that is still a few percentage points above the weaker levels from February.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;([&lt;a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png)\"&gt;https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png)&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bearish sentiment in turn rose 13.9 percentage points which was the biggest one-week uptick since August 2019 when it rose 24.14 percentage points. At 41.4%, bearish sentiment is now at the highest level since the week of March 17th. That is an elevated reading and a big move week over week, but it is also well off recent highs from the past few months that were more than 10 percentage points higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bears.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bull-bear spread tipped into positive territory for the first time in 2022 last week, but the big inverse moves between bulls and bears erased much of the past few weeks&amp;#39; move. The spread is down to -16.7 which is still 13.6 points above the late February low of -30.3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-BB-Spread.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big pickup in the number of respondents reporting as bearish didn&amp;#39;t entirely come from the bullish camp. Neutral sentiment also shed a significant amount falling from 40.6% last week to 33.9%. That is essentially mean reversion as neutral sentiment now sits only a couple of points above the historical average.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Neutral.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Near Record Low in Jobless Claims&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s jobless claims release was significant in a couple of ways. For starters, the Department of Labor revised seasonal adjustment factors (more on that below) and second, the most recent print for the seasonally adjusted number hit one of the lowest levels on record. Claims came in at 166K which tied the number from two weeks ago (after revisions) for the second-lowest reading on record behind the week of 11/29/68. That week&amp;#39;s reading was only 4K lower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for continuing claims, this week&amp;#39;s reading was higher rising from 1.506 million to 1.523 million. Having come off last week&amp;#39;s low, that remains one of the strongest levels since 1970.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pivoting back to initial claims, while adjusted claims are at multi-decade lows, non-seasonally adjusted claims are very healthy but not quite at a record. At current levels of 193.1K, the only year with a lower reading for the comparable week of the year was 1969 (170K) but at the seasonal lows in the few years prior to the pandemic, claims were even stronger than they are now. So while unadjusted claims are strong, the seasonally adjusted number was even more eyecatching this week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for why the seasonally adjusted number appears so much stronger, as shown in the second chart below, the current week of the year has historically been the second most consistent week of the year in seeing a week-over-week increase in claims. As a period with consistent seasonal headwinds, the seasonal adjustment would control for this by depressing the level of claims by a relatively strong seasonal factor. That usual increase was not seen this year as NSA claims were actually slightly lower falling from 196.8K to 193.1K. That means seasonal adjustment helped out what was already a strong number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally worth noting this week is the DOL changed its seasonal adjustment methodology. The DOL fully describes the change in this week&amp;#39;s release and links to further reading on the topic for those interested in going deeper into the weeds, but to briefly summarize: periods when the level of an economic indicator experiences historic shifts in levels as claims did in 2020 and 2021, multiplicative adjustment (which has been used in &amp;quot;normal times&amp;quot; like prior to the pandemic and from here forward) would tend to over or understate adjusted claims. Additive adjustment, on the other hand, is less affected by the actual level of the indicator meaning it would lead to more accurate approximations of seasonally adjusted numbers in times of sudden spikes in the series. This methodology has been used throughout the pandemic period. Now that claims have more or less returned to a more normal range of readings, the DOL sees it justifiable to switch the seasonal adjustment methodology back to multiplicative. While that does not mean too much for interpreting claims, that change in methodology has led to some large downward revisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA2.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;10 Things To Know About Inverted Yield Curves&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest stories over the past few weeks has been the inversion of various points on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The more well-known 2-year/10-year yield curve spread inverted on April 1, 2022 for the first time since 2019, while the 5-year/30-year inverted for the first time since 2006 on March 28.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is a yield curve? The yield curve plots the yield of different maturity bonds, usually Treasuries. In normal times, a longer dated bond should have a higher yield than a shorter dated bond. Historically, after key parts of the yield curve invert, the economy eventually has moved into a recession. This is why these signals are quiet important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are ten things to know about the yield curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Yes, past recessions have been proceeded by an inverted yield curve, but by no means does it happen right away. Another way to put it is yield curve inversions have preceded all recessions, but not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession. Historically, when the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverts, a recession has taken place an average about 19 months later.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.5.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What about stocks? “One of the bigger surprises for investors is that stocks historically have actually done quite well after previous inversions,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index gained another 29% on average and peaked nearly 17 months later after the previous four inversions.” The bottom line is a yield curve inversion is a warning sign, but by no means does that mean trouble is coming immediately.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.5.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the LPL Research Chart of the Day (shown below), here is how the S&amp;amp;P 500 has done after all the 2-year/10-year inversions going back to the mid-1960s. Once again, some of the more recent performance has been quite impressive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-3-4.5.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing investors seem to be ignoring lately though is the short-end of the curve. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) came out recently saying as much in Don’t Fear the Yield Curve. They concluded that the 2-year/10-year yield curve wasn’t a good indicator for recessions; instead the near-term spread between the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has been much better. Take note that the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has steepened significantly the past few months, reducing the chances of a recession. Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Powell said last month that the economy was on firm footing and would be able to withstand rate hikes. In other words, the Fed isn’t worried about a recession quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, the 3-month/10-year yield curve recently was at its steepest level in 5 years! This has been our personal favorite part of the yield curve to use as a signal for a pending recession (as the 2-year/10-year has given false signals before) and if and until this curve inverts, we believe the odds of a recession on the horizon is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4-4.5.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yield curves are one part of the bond market, but what the credit markets are saying is another (think of them as bond investors take on financial conditions) and we see a much different opinion here. Lately, high yield bonds have outperformed Treasuries ( Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield index and the Bloomberg US Treasury index), a clue the credit markets weren’t very worried about economic growth going forward. In the past, trouble starts brewing when high yield underperforms Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, spreads on high yield and investment grade corporates have both come back significantly the past few weeks. “To see credit markets showing major signs of improvement the past few weeks is a great sign that financial conditions are probably better than most think,” explained Detrick. “Yes, the yield curve is flashing some warnings, but overall the credit markets are saying don’t get overly worried just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-5-4.5.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real rates (rates adjusted for inflation) are negative. With the 10-year breakeven rate, what the bond market thinks inflation will average over the next 10 years, currently near 2.8% and the 10-year Treasury yield currently near 2.5%, real yields are actually negative. Historically, negative real rates have been quite bullish for risk assets. The Roaring 1920s, then during the 1940s and 1950s, were the last time we saw an extended period of negative real rates. As history told us, those decades saw explosive growth and stock market gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real yield curves (adjusted for inflation) are still upwardly sloping. Take note, we’ve seen real yields invert ahead of recessions in the past along with nominal yield curves (2006 and 2019 most recently), yet another clue a recession might not be as close as some fear. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs noted that nominal curves tend to invert more easily in high inflation environments (we can check this box now), suggesting it would take a deeper inversion than recent cycles to trigger a recession signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-6-4.5.22.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lastly, the Fed owns nearly $9 trillion in bonds and 25% of the entire Treasury market. Who knows where yields would be if they didn’t own any, but most agree longer-term yields would likely be much higher. So maybe various yield curves wouldn’t be inverted or even that close to inverting? This concept is mere conjecture, but it is a note we’ve seen lately that is at least worth pointing out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to digest here and this isn’t an easy subject, but the bottom line is the takeaway isn’t as simple as an inverted yield curve means a recession is imminent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;What the Yield Curve Is, and Isn’t, Signaling… Yet&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shape of U.S Treasury yield curve is often looked at as a barometer for U.S. economic growth. More specifically, it reflects how the Federal Reserve (Fed) intends to stimulate or slow economic growth by cutting or raising its policy rate. Each tenor on the curve is roughly the expected policy rate plus or minus a term premium (the term premium represents the expected compensation for lending for longer periods of time). In “normal” times, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning longer maturity Treasury yields are higher than shorter maturity Treasury yields. However, when the economy is growing too quickly, inflationary pressures are apparent, and the Fed wants to slow growth, shorter maturity securities could eventually out-yield longer maturity securities, inverting the yield curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Yield curve inversion is likely going to be the phrase of the year in 2022,” noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. “However, we don’t think recession is in the cards for this year. If the Fed follows through with the expected rate hikes however—a big if—we’re likely going to see the 3 month/ 10 year close to inversion by the end of the year, which would likely mean recession could be a 2023/2024 event.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we look at the yield curve currently, we see two different signals. As seen on the LPL Chart of the Day, the 2-year yield is currently out-yielding the 10-year Treasury yield and is thus inverted. However, when we look at shorter maturities, such as the difference between the 3-month Treasury yield and the 10-year Treasury yield, the curve is still very steep, which makes sense since the Fed has only raised interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) this year. The difference in the 2-year Treasury yield and the 10-year Treasury yield measures market expectations of what the Fed may do—not what it has already done. Using shorter parts of the yield curve, which is what the academic research supports, measures what the Fed has already done and may be a better indicator of near-term recession risks. Fed rate hikes are used to slow economic growth so it’s the reality of these hikes that leads the economy to contract—not the threat of rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-4.5.22-.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The past six times the 2Y/10Y part of the yield curve inverted, a recession followed, on average, 18 months later. However, the length of time between the quickest time to recession (6 months) and the longest time until recession (nearly 36 months!) complicates the signal and in the Fed’s words, the relationship is probably spurious. Additionally, the signal may not be as robust as it once was as central banks around the world have implemented aggressive quantitative easing programs that have likely impacted market signals. In the U.S., for example, the Fed owns more than 25% of Treasury securities outstanding and continues to reinvest coupon and principal payments into the Treasury market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, we don’t think investors should ignore the 2Y/10Y signal altogether. We acknowledge that given the nuances surrounding current economic dynamics and with the Fed likely to respond more aggressively than previous rate hiking campaigns to arrest stubbornly high consumer price increases, recessionary risks have likely been pulled forward into 2023/2024. That said, we still expect the economy to grow above trend this year given underlying consumer strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;April’s Stellar Track Record&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;April has been nearly perfect with gains steadily building from the first trading day to the last with only the occasional and minor blip along the way. DJIA has been up 16 Aprils in a row with an average gain of 2.9%. S&amp;amp;P 500 has been up 15 of the last 16 Aprils with an average gain of 3.1%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;April is last month of the Best Six Months November-April and when we begin tracking our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could keep the current rally intact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;April got off to its usual stellar start the first two trading days of the month, but some surprisingly hawkish remarks from the usually dovish Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard has stocks on the ropes today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barring any major escalation in Ukraine, we suspect the market to log additional gains in April as the Best Six Months come to a close and then move sideways during much of Q2 and Q3. Likely testing the lows before rallying in Q4 and into 2023.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our “Best Six Months” switching strategy found in our annual Stock Trader’s Almanac which is basically the flipside of the old “sell in May and Go Away” adage. After decades of historical research, we discovered that most market gains occur during the months November through April. Investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between November 1st and April 30th each year and then switching into fixed income for the other six months has produced reliable returns with reduced risk since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/8eb4bb8941d8a2d9430a5eb6f25bf83d/a5e96b53ee0174f2-1c/s500x750/0317fb8785a49f4760201d6b10d27ac9c1c67010.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&amp;#39;S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&amp;#39;S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp;amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monday 4.11.22 Before Market Open:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&amp;#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES!]())&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(NONE.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monday 4.11.22 After Market Close:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&amp;#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES!]())&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(NONE.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday 4.12.22 Before Market Open:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eBYRTvX.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY&amp;#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday 4.12.22 After Market Close:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY&amp;#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES!]())&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(NONE.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday 4.13.22 Before Market Open:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/zPpYFDe.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY&amp;#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday 4.13.22 After Market Close:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/aP5tBsh.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY&amp;#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday 4.14.22 Before Market Open:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/p38b4Pg.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY&amp;#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday 4.14.22 After Market Close:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY&amp;#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES!]())&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(NONE.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday 4.15.22 Before Market Open:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY&amp;#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp;amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(NONE.
