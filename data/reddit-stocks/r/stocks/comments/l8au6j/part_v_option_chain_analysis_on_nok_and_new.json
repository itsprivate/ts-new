In this case, the dates range from 29 January  to 16 July.</sup></p>\n\n<p>What we can learn from these numbers -</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Long term market sentiment for $NOK is <em>extremely</em> bullish. <strong>85.21% of LEAPS options currently in circulation expect the price of $NOK to rise above $5, $7 and $10 over the next 12+ months.</strong></li>\n<li>Short term market sentiment is also <em>extremely</em> high. <strong>89.19% of short term options currently in circulation expect the price of $NOK to rise above $5, $7, and $10 over the next 6 months.</strong></li>\n<li>There is still a relatively high volume of Put Options at $5, which may be part of the reason we see such high volatility around that price. Beyond $5, the ratio of Puts to Calls gets slimmer, which will likely lead to better stability as prices rises.</li>\n<li>Today&#39;s option volume was very high for Calls, and 100% of those Calls were covered. I wouldn&#39;t expect much gamma ramping (sudden upward jumps in price) as we go forward.</li>\n<li>Trade volume of shares was ~350 million today. This is significantly lower than the weekly highs which exceeded 1 billion. This is likely why we saw only small movements. There were also quite a few sell-offs as the price reached a high of $5.22.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>____________________________________________________</p>\n\n<h1>Nokia&#39;s Growing Business</h1>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll keep this section short and sweet like I promised. All of these links come from <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-and-stock-exchange-releases/\">Nokia&#39;s Investor Relations News</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here is Nokia&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/12/22/nokia-corporation-financial-calendar-for-2021/\">Financial Calendar</a>. This is good stuff to keep track of if you are investing for the long haul.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just gonna list off a handful of big things that have occurred so far in January 2021 -</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment/\">Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-shanghai-bell-to-deploy-next-generation-network-for-airport-authority-hong-kong/\">Nokia Shanghai Bell to deploy next-generation network for Airport Authority Hong Kong</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-supports-t-mobile-5g-evolution-with-five-year-expansion-deal/\">Nokia supports T-Mobile 5G evolution with five-year expansion deal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/google-cloud-nokia-partner-to-accelerate-cloud-native-5g-readiness-for-communication-service-providers/\">Google Cloud, Nokia partner to accelerate cloud-native 5G readiness for communication service providers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-selected-for-us-federal-5g-cybersecurity-project/\">Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/20/nokia-and-mobily-pilot-worlds-first-4g-and-5g-fixed-wireless-access-network-slicing/\">Nokia and Mobily pilot world’s first 4G and 5G Fixed Wireless Access network slicing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/26/nokias-comprehensive-c-band-portfolio-ready-for-5g-build-out-in-us/\">Nokia’s comprehensive C-Band portfolio ready for 5G build-out in U.S.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The list goes on and on. There is <em>so much more</em> that isn&#39;t listed here. A lot of these new developments will start taking effect in Fiscal Year 2021 and 2022, which can lead to major growth.</p>\n\n<p>__________________________________________________</p>\n\n<h1>Finances Summary</h1>\n\n<p>For a full look at the finances and a comparison with Qualcomm and Ericsson, check out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/\">Part III</a>. I&#39;m just gonna summarize what was said over there.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">$NOK Data (Converted to USD)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Book Value</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$47.43 Billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Total Debt</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$6.43 Billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Repayment of Debt</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$542 Million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Free Cash Flow</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$2.35 Billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Net Revenue TTM</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$890 Million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Operating Income</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$2.09 Billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Market Value</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>~$24 Billion</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>In Part III we did a comparison between Nokia, Qualcomm, and Ericsson. Based on the numbers, it&#39;s pretty apparent how undervalued Nokia is compared to the competition - both of whom boast very similar finances. I again urge you to read <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/\">my post</a> on the finances for a better explanation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>____________________________________________________</strong></p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR</h1>\n\n<p>Market sentiment for $NOK is extremely high as we get ready to move into earnings week. Trade volume of shares has gone down, while option volume and open interest has trended upwards. </p>\n\n<p>Financial data and press releases from Nokia indicate that the company is expecting to perform very well in the long term, with an abundance of new business coming in.</p>\n\n<p>I would again encourage you to read my other posts. They all include TL;DRs for the lazy.</p>\n\n<p>________________________________________________</p>\n\n<h1>Disclaimer and my Holdings -</h1>\n\n<p>I currently own 10 of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK210716C00005000?p=NOK210716C00005000\">these bad boys</a>. Those are $5 Call options that expire 16 July 2021. I&#39;ll be holding these for a while 🚀.</p>\n\n<p>If you see anything wrong or something that should be changed, please let me know! I learn a lot from you guys as well.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am not a CFA or any of that, just a curious investor who likes numbers, so this is meant to be an informative post and not a recommendation.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
