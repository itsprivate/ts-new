I'm not saying the market won't go down from here, but just be mindful of the agenda of people who post here and the fact they have an interest in things panning out this way. Take things with a grain of salt. Wsb was wrong before, and they'll likely be wrong again. I know this sub isn't wsb, but there's a lot of leakage. Most wsb users would also browse here obviously.\n\nThis sub also has strong herd mentality. Latching on to whatever has been going up recently (or at least hasn't going down). The new darling of the sub seems to be BRK.B for that very reason. Few months ago, it was NVDA (don't hear much about it now). Now obviously oil and commodities are what you should be in (despite having had poor returns over last decades, but yeah let's all pile in after a big spike).\n\nTruth is, this is mostly an echo chamber of what's \"cool\" right now and telling everyone what they should've been in all along.\n\nRemember, if we'd listened to the hivemind before, we'd have gone all in ARKK this time last year.\nWe'd have bought puts right before the biggest bull in run this time 2 years ago.",
