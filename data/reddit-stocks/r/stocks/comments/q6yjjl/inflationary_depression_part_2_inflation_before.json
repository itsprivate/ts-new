  "selftext": "Now a lot of what will be said here is not what you are used to seeing in the market news but bear with me. Some of this will be new because we *rarely* see inflationary depressions in countries who are a reserve currency (for those of you who do not know, the USA is a reserve currency). They are extremely rare (in the United States), and it takes a special set of circumstances to cause them. Read Part 1 on the sub BurryEdge to understand the bubble.\n\nHow is this bubble different?\n\nThe thing about Inflationary depressions is that the bubble leading up to an inflationary depression is extremely similar to a disinflationary depression such as 1929, 1999, 2008. These all came due to inflated assets that needed to come back down to earth. The 1999 crash is probably the most similar since it had relatively low household debt and it was caused by irrational exuberance. Currently we do not share the same debt to GDP that was seen in 2008 although it is beginning to climb (due to low interest rates and highly priced assets). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, without the internet mania of 1999 (you could argue tech has the same amount of hype but it’s not quite the same) why are we in such a huge asset bubble? Well, the reasoning is because as you can see in Part 1, we have been producing Money supply at all-time highs with the lowest interest rates this country has ever seen for the past 12 years (and it is again at 0%) with very little GDP Growth. \n\nAs you can see the Fed has left interest rates near zero for most of the past 12 years and only briefly hitting 2.5% when it was raising rates. There is a similar trend in Quantitative Easing. Instead of tightening the money supply and selling the bonds back into the market the Fed has kept increasing the amount of assets held to 800 billion in 2008 to over 2 trillion now. Part of the reason for this is the taper tantrum in 2014 and the 2018 drop in stocks due to the 2.5% rate increase discussed earlier (also right before the Fed was supposedly going to unwind its balance sheet). What this shows me is that the market is coasting on the Fed right now and easy lending. 2018 is only a taste of what stocks will do if interest rates and tapering were to end. As with what was discussed in Part 1, the government is pumping money into this economy at all-time highs and the market has delivered in kind. This is just reinforcing the point that this market and the United States is being pushed up by Government Spending (as seen in Part 1) and Lax Monetary Policy.\n\n**The Output Gap**\n\nWell, I’m sure some of you are thinking that “just because there is a large money supply doesn’t mean there will be large amounts of inflation and also none of this proves that the government is keeping the economy afloat”. \n\nEnter the output gap. The output gap is found by the following (Output is in reference to GDP):\n\nPreferably we want the output gap to be equal to zero, this indicates that the market is operating efficiently. Now what if it isn’t zero?\n\nA *negative output gap* indicates there’s slack in the economy as resources are being underutilized. The economy is performing below potential. And deflationary forces occur.\n\nA *positive output gap* means any slack has evaporated and resources are being fully employed, maybe even to the point of overcapacity. In this case, the economy is performing above potential. Inflationary forces occur.\n\nCurrently according to the Fed, we are operating “below” our potential GDP or at a negative output gap which was the case in *2020*. Now what is our potential GDP or how do we determine it. The way we determine potential GDP is by looking at Labor Supply Growth, Improvement of workforce quality, capital stock growth (machinery and equipment for and other capital investments such as infrastructure), technology advances that increase productivity, and increased availability of resources. GDP on the other hand is calculated by Consumption (C) plus Investment (I) plus Government spending (G) plus net exports. The point I am attempting to build up is that the Government is spending too much money and the output gap is actually *positive* due to an increase in real GDP and a decrease in potential GDP. To prove this, I will break down potential GDP:\n\n*Potential GDP has decreased*\n\nI am going to assume certain things will be at a fixed growth rate, technology that advances increased productivity, capital stock growth (it might increase but not substantially), and improvement of workforce quality (unlikely to change soon unless the US changes immigration laws), and the availability of natural resources (I don’t think this has changed much unless you count the current logistics shortages which is arguable, but I don’t believe it is a factor). \n\nSo, let’s look at “Growth in Labor Supply”. Our unemployment rate is not particularly high at 4.8% so your first instinct might be that our labor supply is growing, that is not the case. The labor force experienced the biggest dip in over 100 years, and it has not even gotten close to recovering to the pre-pandemic levels. Pre-pandemic labor force is roughly 164.5 million in February 2020, then an immediate drop to 158 million in April 2020, followed by an immediate increase to 160 million in July of 2020 and we are currently at 161.3 million over a year and a quarter later (at the current pace since July 2020 we would get back to the 2019 labor force around 2025). This shows that the current change in the labor force is permanent and will not bounce back as quickly as people thought. Hence reducing Growth in Labor Supply and the major key: the US Potential GDP is reduced.\n\nSo, if we look at the US GDP vs the Potential GDP (If this sub can’t post links/pictures, I highly suggest you go look at the chart for the US Real GDP vs US Potential GDP created by the Fed, as I will discuss that graph). If you look at the US GDP you will see that it is below the potential GDP but this is misconstrued because due to the permanent change in the United States Labor Supply we are actually producing more GDP than our Potential hence creating a positive output gap (hence why we are experiencing higher than usual inflation)! Also, as you can see, GDP is rapidly increasing which is just going to increase our current output gap. This causes inflation to occur.\n\nNow to see it more visually, our long run aggregate supply is our potential output and it is to the left of the equilibrium of aggregate supply and demand, but our short-run aggregate has shifted to the left a little due to prices in raw materials, energy prices, wages, and soon to be increases in taxes and subsidies (we are beginning to see the shift to the long run aggregate supply), and our aggregate demand has shifted to the right due to increases in the M2. This gives us a chart similar to the chart pictured below, with the supply curve slowly shifting to the left (due to shortages) while the aggregate demand curve keeps shifting to the right as the government keeps increasing M2: \n\nAs you can see this will cause prices to increase in the long run due to overstimulation by the United States Government and is the key to understanding our current inflation predicament.\n\n*The Velocity of Money*\n\nWell, why hasn’t the inflation been off the charts? With everything I have explained in the last 2 posts that must be your dying question. The answer to that is found in the velocity of money which is at the lowest point in history. But before we dive into the velocity of money, let’s look at the United States Savings Rate. US households have been saving at record levels, Americans haven’t saved more since the 1970s.\n\nThis indicates that the velocity of money is low AND there is still a large amount of money supply ready to be spent. The other thing we are seeing is that velocity of money might be at historical lows, but it has been moving that direction for years. \n\nThis shows that for years that *investors* have been hoarding cash because the US treasury bond is not the place to invest due to interest rates being near zero for so long (check out graph 2), this has caused investors to hold onto liquid cash as a store of value (since they clearly aren’t spending it, and it doesn’t make much sense to invest in a treasury bond). \n\nVelocity of money did not just plummet from money supply increases but *also* plummeted due to the lockdowns provided by COVID. So, although in the past we have seen the velocity of money negate the money supply and keep inflation low, that is no longer the case. The problem now is that inflation has set in (due to the increase in money supply and a flat lined velocity of money) and now that has left the velocity of money to become a ticking time bomb for the United States. Usually, the money supply and velocity of money work inversely (there is no exact way to measure the velocity of money) but, as inflation picks up the inflationary psychology sets in which could cause consumers to start spending much more rapidly increasing the velocity of money. Basically, when consumers come to expect inflation then they will be much more likely to spend more money (increasing velocity of money). In extreme cases, money supply and velocity of money can increase at the same time leading to massive spikes in prices as found by this formula, (Money Supply \\* Velocity of Money)/GDP = Price. Some economists like to say the velocity of money is constant, but this is not the case. The inflation mindset can set in very rapidly, leading to rapid increase in our current low levels of velocity of money, hence creating a facade of safety. But of course, consumers aren’t in the inflationary mindset \\*sarcasm\\* (just google \"consumers will shop earlier this holiday season\"). \n\n**The Fed must react:**\n\nSo, what can the Fed do? They must taper rapidly and increase interest rates; this will cause markets to crash but on their current course this could have been avoided if they had done this sooner (basically they created an asset bubble and now they need to pop it). The Fed will start “speaking differently” while acting like there is inflation (basically the Fed will ensure everything is under control while their “act” show things aren’t under control to stop the inflationary mindset from taking root and stopping the dollar from devaluing). The problem with tapering is this could cause capital flight as they (government) don’t want to increase interest rates as their deficits get out of control (lower interest rate means more government money to spend). Investors won’t be willing to buy US bonds though as real returns sink into the negatives, so the increase in interest rates will decrease government spending, at least hopefully (something to watch for). As markets crash along with other assets this will lead to another economic contraction.\n\nThe slower the Fed is to react the worse this will get as Congress passes budgets further stimulating the economy. If they wait too long to increase interest rates the velocity of money will pick up as inflation since the money supply is at insane levels, leading to extremely large increases in interest rates which can have a devastating effect on the economy. As the inflation mindset starts to take hold people will begin to shift money to commodities or spend it (as there is no reason to hold a devaluing currency) and due to the large amount of money supply, they have a lot of money to spend. Although this will slightly affect aggregate supply by increasing unemployment, it will crush inflation which can be much worse. This would cause assets to pop as debt becomes much more expensive and the discount rate increases. The Fed could also sell back the assets to the market, also decreasing the amount of “printed” money in circulation and reducing their budget (sorry I am pipe dreaming). The Fed does not seem interested in any of these measures currently though, as it is very hard to look at the congress that appointed you and tell them that you’re going to crash the market and truly act independent (Volcker deserves the world). If the Fed acts too slow or not at all, this could easily spiral into extreme inflation with extremely high interest rates (rather than moderate/controlled increases in interest rates by the Fed), and an extremely devalued currency leading to an impossibly uphill battle for the Fed in the future and a long term much worse outlook for society. This is the beginning of an inflationary recession.\n\nIn Part 3, I will discuss how to make money on how we expect markets to react to the resulting inflation that we expect to see and overall discussion about the current shortages (sorry, I said that would be in part 3 but I lied). I promise, I was not under the influence when I wrote this, I am just an engineer aka sorry for the way I write. I only edited this a little bit so I will not act like I'm a grammatical star haha but thanks for reading!\n\nAlso I would like to thank the folks over at BurryEdge for helping me write this, with their daily input in the discord and various ideas and critiques it has helped me shape this series for everyone.\n\nThis is not investing advice. I am not a professional.",
