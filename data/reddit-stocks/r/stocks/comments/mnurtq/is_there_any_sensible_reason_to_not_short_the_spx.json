I don&#39;t know if this fits on this sub but I decided to take that risk.</p>\n\n<p>Student here, working part time at an institutional asset manager (and not a native english speaker). I seem to be confused with the current market behaviour as it defies everything I&#39;ve learned so far.</p>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate if anyone could beat some sense into me and educate me as to why I shouldn&#39;t sell and heavily short equities right now. I already lost the biggest part of my portfolio this week but I just don&#39;t seem to be able to change my mind. </p>\n\n<p>To start let me summarize the current situation (note that the selected information will be biased by me, even if it&#39;s not conciously). I will mainly focus on the S&amp;P 500 (SPX/^GSPC) for simplicity and structure it like this:</p>\n\n<p>------------------</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Index Price and Analyst Expectations</li>\n<li>Indicators and Benchmarks</li>\n<li>Economic Numbers, Trends, News and Sentiment</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The rant is happening in part 3 mostly. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s allowed but I linked some pictures with imgur-urls. </p>\n\n<p>-------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>1a) Analysts Targets</strong></p>\n\n<p>During this week, I heard about 10 Analysts from Banks and Asset Managers (GM,JPM,CS,UBS, some hedge funds) say that they expect the S&amp;P to have an upside-potential to 4&#39;200. The expected EOY-Median is also 4&#39;200, though the Expectation for EOY 2021 was only 3&#39;950-4&#39;000 at the beginning of this year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/3yr48h3\">https://imgur.com/3yr48h3</a> (Short Term Boundaries)</p>\n\n<p>It seems kind of weird to me how we almost already touched that 4&#39;200 upper limit. Even weirder how every single analyst had the same target for the S&amp;P 500 and every single one said &quot;we remain bullish on US equities&quot;. Their explanations haven&#39;t really convinced me as none of them could really answer the shows hosts on the question why they remain bullish even though we&#39;re up that far already.</p>\n\n<p>We hit ATH 20 times this year, with 5 of them having happened in the last 10 business days.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ\">https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ</a> (ATHs marked red (SPX Closing Prices))</p>\n\n<p>With earnings ahead, I don&#39;t get how this should be going even further up. Especially on the news we&#39;re facing (see further down part 3).</p>\n\n<p>--------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>1b) Volume and VIX</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Trading volume can signal when an investor should take profits and sell a security due to low activity. (Investopedia)</em></li>\n<li><em>In the U.S. stock market and many other developed financial markets, about 70-80 percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading.</em></li>\n<li><em>The algos provide great liquidity when there is no news, but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hmm okay. We had 70 business days so far in 2021 and out of the last 10 there are 7 days in the top 10 lowest daily trading volume (YTD, since 01-01-2021). If we&#39;re supposedly in &#39;bullish&#39; situation, why is the volume going down so rapidly and the trading so frothy? Are the algos idling to meet the ESG-benchmarks or?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/K0QP0ny\">https://imgur.com/K0QP0ny</a>  (Daily Trading Volume S&amp;P 500 YTD)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/aYBtNtd\">https://imgur.com/aYBtNtd</a> (Rank of 10 last trading sessions (1=Lowest Trading Volume YTD on S&amp;P 500))</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re also at the lowest VIX-Level on the 1Y-Chart which I learned is usually a sell signal (shortterm).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/ZaDBIg7\">https://imgur.com/ZaDBIg7</a> (VIX 5Y Chart)</p>\n\n<p>-----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>1c) Psychological Factors (SideNote)</strong></p>\n\n<p>April has been the best performing month for US equities for the last two decades. April was performing net-positive in 14 out of the last 15 years (excluding 2008).</p>\n\n<p>The best performing equities in april are historically european stocks, followed by US stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that this month started at 3&#39;992 (ATH) I&#39;m having doubts that the trend will repeat this time though.</p>\n\n<p>-----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Technicals</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2a) MA, MACD</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m kind of a believer in the theory that most technical indicators only work because actual systems and people trade by their principles. Having said that it&#39;s obviously kind of misleading to use momentum indicators as all of them are giving us strong buy signals even at ATH levels:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/QxEygiE\">https://imgur.com/QxEygiE</a> (Barchart Indicators with their buy signals)</p>\n\n<p>Just to note; we&#39;re obviously above moving averages at this point: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/7kKPwvj\">https://imgur.com/7kKPwvj</a> </p>\n\n<p>-----------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>2b) RSI, PE Ratio</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s really difficult for me to evaluate the usefulness of value-based indicators like the buffet-indicator or the PE ratio. They ignore the decrease in interest rates and the influx of retail money into equities:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/S86bESi\">https://imgur.com/S86bESi</a></p>\n\n<p>Without that in mind the stock-market values would look pretty wild at this point;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/BtImQgc\">https://imgur.com/BtImQgc</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>2b) PE Ratio</strong></p>\n\n<p>The same logic applies to price-to-earnings ratios;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5\">https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5</a> (Shiller/CAPE PE Ratio for the SPX)</p>\n\n<p>Still ... what bothers me is that the PE ratios of US indices are so much higher than the rest of the world:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/2D415BE\">https://imgur.com/2D415BE</a> (Shiller/Cape PE Ratio major equitiy indices)</p>\n\n<p>The worst one is not even listed here - the current ratio of the NDX (Nasdaq 100) lies at 50.19!</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s as if investors don&#39;t expect any growth outside of US companies or am I interpreting that wrong? It&#39;s not like inflation is higher in the US either (though there is a certain depreciation in the USD).</p>\n\n<p>And if the earnings so obviously don&#39;t matter (anymore), how can analysts like this guy from Credit Suisse say that the prices are soaring due to the strong earnings??? (Src; Bloomberg-Link)</p>\n\n<p>And lastly I understand the 21day-RSI crossing 70+ as a sell signal or is that wrong again?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/xMAFJrv\">https://imgur.com/xMAFJrv</a> (SPX 21D-RSI on lower chart with BS-boundaries on upper chart)</p>\n\n<p>----------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) Economic Data, Trends, News, Sentiments</strong></p>\n\n<p>Oh god here we go. I will not provide as much details and pictures so let me summarize the most important points IMO a bit:</p>\n\n<p>3a) Job Market</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Date</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Actual</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Expected</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">25-mar</td>\n<td align=\"left\">684</td>\n<td align=\"left\">730</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">1-apr</td>\n<td align=\"left\">719</td>\n<td align=\"left\">680</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">7-apr</td>\n<td align=\"left\">744</td>\n<td align=\"left\">680</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The weekly jobless-claims reached a pandemic-era low <strong>2 weeks ago</strong> (25-mar) which resulted in the index going up 50bp.</li>\n<li><strong>Last week</strong> we had larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 50bp.</li>\n<li><strong>This week</strong> we had way larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 30bp.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It&#39;s weird how these numbers were celebrated and being sold as the reason for rising equity prices with one reason being that the FED seemingly only talks about the job numbers as their motivation for propping up the economy.</p>\n\n<p>Now that the numbers went bad they suddenly do not matter anymore. It actually pissed me off how Tom Keene saw these numbers on Bloomberg TV and said &quot;if we&#39;re being honest, how much do these numbers matter anyway? They are just transitory&quot;... like ... why did you care about them before then?</p>\n\n<p>-------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>3b) Inflation and Yields (fixed income)</strong></p>\n\n<p>You guys probably kept an eye on the treasury yields too as they seem to have caused a small taper tantrum in the first days of march. Analysts expect the 10Y US Tr. Yield to reach about 2% this year. As the treasuries usually act as benchmark for other assets, mortgage interest rates and bond rates have spiked as well.</p>\n\n<p>This SHOULD be bad for high-risk assets (also as in high debt-ratios) short- to mid-term like overvalued stocks as found in the Nasdaq/SPX-Components. News Outlets were talking for WEEKS about the reflation trade and the shift from growth to value stocks. There were theories about quant funds shifting big time etc. ... as it stands we&#39;re kind of back with our major growth indices though?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn\">https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn</a> (YTD: NDX and SPX above and 10Y Tr. Yield below)</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not like the treasury yields have retreated much, but for some reason the major tech stocks all jumped 5% to 15% this week... and they&#39;re saying that financial corps will do the same next week.</p>\n\n<p>The PPI data released today only indicates even higher inflation expectations - same in other countries like china (4.4% actual):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/vh4TDek\">https://imgur.com/vh4TDek</a> (US PPI Month over Month)</p>\n\n<p>I get that higher yields are good for the financial sector and that a depreciation in the USD drives US equities as well (and inflation in US = USD loses value c.p.). But I still don&#39;t see why tech jumped.</p>\n\n<p>------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>3c) Risk in the financial sector</strong></p>\n\n<p>With low yields (well until recently) the leverage ratio increased substantially and even the FEDs balance sheet kind of imploded due to the pandemic. There is so much money in the market and so much leverage just so guaranteed rates can be delivered ... I wonder how this is not a sign of risk to anyone?</p>\n\n<p>We just had the bust of a fund with Archegos that erased about USD 194 billion of market value and a similar picture with Greensill capital or the supposed short-sellers of equities in january. Even after this, Credit Suisse somehow thinks that they have proper risk management lol. And I wish I wouldn&#39;t have to say that about one of our &#39;national&#39; banks ... sigh. Oh and somehow Citibank just lost 500M in some transactions... woops?</p>\n\n<p>-----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>3d) Tax revolution</strong></p>\n\n<p>The current projects on better international tax collaboration, higher corporate and individual taxes, a minimum tax rate for companies etc.... all of this sounds like bad news for companies... but somehow it get&#39;s ignored??? Someone help me on this please.</p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>3e) Vaccination Progress</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the current rate, we will achieve global herd immunity in 2022 with cases rising again in Europe and developing/industrial countries.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg\">https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg</a> (Low progress in less wealthy countries)</p>\n\n<p>It seems like the lagging progress outside of the US doesn&#39;t concern the market in the least as we can see with ATHs on european and asian indices. I guess Tom Keene would say that these numbers are irrelevant anyway.</p>\n\n<p>-----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>3f) Chip Shortage</strong></p>\n\n<p>Major car manufacturers halted production (GM, Ford) this week and many tech products can&#39;t meet demand due to the delay in production (like the current MacBooks). It&#39;s a consensus that this issue will stay for a few years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few years.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/4diq83G\">https://imgur.com/4diq83G</a></p>\n\n<p>This is pretty bad news, right? Obviously this means that the market has to go up... like ... I don&#39;t understand. This is an obvious issue but somehow these stocks just go up ...</p>\n\n<p>---------------</p>\n\n<p>There are many other bad news like the Ukraine conflict (where talks about a possible war exist) or the Oil price dilemma and uncertain future of crypto currencies. Or upcoming (major) bond auctions on monday with the release of the new fed bond buying program pace on wednesday. But I&#39;m leaving it at this right now.</p>\n\n<p>---------------</p>\n\n<p>Lastly I want to note my personal destain for Bloomberg News as they seem to be publishing some weird articles lately. There are major news but they kind of spin it into &#39;good news&#39; and (for example) talk about the potential of SPX hitting 4&#39;100+ this week instead. I mostly resorted to Reuters and selected smaller outlets last week for this reason.</p>\n\n<p>---------------</p>\n\n<p>Ok guys, that&#39;s it. I would be happy to have someone explain me why I should be &#39;bullish&#39; on the SPX. I just loaded up on puts (structured products) after losing most of my portfolio this week on rather heavily leveraged puts.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to anyone for reading this.</p>\n\n<p>*If asked I can provide sources on all the info, though I don&#39;t want to link all the sources right away as it takes too much time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
