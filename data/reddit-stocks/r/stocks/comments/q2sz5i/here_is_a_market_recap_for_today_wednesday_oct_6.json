  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 6, 2021**\n\nStocks opened the session lower, with the S&P 500 (SPY) falling as much as 1.2% early before turning positive in yet another volatile session after a report that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said his party would approve an extension of the government debt ceiling until at least December. Market participants collectively gave a massive sigh of relief now that we aren’t staring down the barrel of a default. You can never count on Congress in the US, but I did say I thought it was very unlikely that the Senate was going to let the American economy implode by choice. In my humble opinion, I think the worse is behind us and look forward to buying up the first -5% and -8%  dip in the SPY and Nasdaq (QQQ) all year, though I do expect some choppiness moving forward. \n\nIn recent weeks, market participants have been anxiously monitoring developments out of Washington DC, as Congressional lawmakers debated raising the debt ceiling and avoiding an absolute catastrophe if the US were to default on its debt, something that has never (and hopefully will never) happen. Put bluntly, a debt default would plunge the economy into a long-lasting recession, GDP growth would slide and millions would lose their jobs. According to a report by Moody’s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. “Internationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline”\n\nThe report goes on to say, “Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government’s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.”\n\nMoreover, despite valid concerns surrounding inflation, recent economic data has been very upbeat recently, a sign that despite there being many obstacles remaining, the US economy continues to recover from the pandemic-induced recession. Durable goods, retail sales, and purchasing managers index-tracking activity across US manufacturing have all recently topped expectations. However, prices for those goods remain elevated compared to earlier periods due to ongoing supply-chain disruptions, shortages in key materials, and recently, rolling blackouts in China that have forced the closure of crucial factories ahead of the busiest shopping season of the year. \n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-energy-crunch-triggers-alarm-pleas-more-coal-2021-09-28/](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-energy-crunch-triggers-alarm-pleas-more-coal-2021-09-28/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Alphabet Inc's (GOOG) Google said it cut fuel use and traffic delays by 10% to 20% at four locations in Israel by using artificial intelligence to optimize signal lights and plans to test the software in Rio de Janeiro, the company said on Wednesday.\n* Tesla (TSLA) will have to pay $130 in punitive damages and $7 million to the victim after a jury found the automaker guilty of failing to take appropriate steps to prevent race-based harassment of factory workers.
