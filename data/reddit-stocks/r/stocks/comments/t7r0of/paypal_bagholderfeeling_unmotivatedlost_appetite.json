So even with 18% revenue growth for next few years I think paypal is a steal at this price. With all the insider buying Nancy Pelosi buying I think it should go up. Should I been concerned with PayPal stock in future?every one in my friend circle is down atleast 30% portfolio. And they dnt look worried. And they keep saying me paypal is a safe bet it will go up in an year. What you guys says on this",
