No one individual gets to say I can&#39;t buy this stock at 233. Imagine not letting people buy Tesla because they say it is not worth 810 billion dollars as of today. When would a brokerage ever try and stop retail from losing money? They only stopped buying because there was risk of an infinite squeeze. This is not a reason to halt buying, they halted buying not just for those at risk of not being able to pay, they halted buying for EVERYONE. Anyone with one ounce of economics knows if you stop allowing buying you completely shift your supply and demand graph to the right cratering shares.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it. There is a BIGGER question here. Something very fishy is going on.</p>\n\n<p>Please share this as wide as possible. Brokerages have no right to tell us in a free market how much we can and cannot pay for a stock.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to Delivers Since 2010: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R4pSK-JAxMssip8QOBgCCpDfuizidvIx211riwjp7dY/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R4pSK-JAxMssip8QOBgCCpDfuizidvIx211riwjp7dY/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure: I own GME.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
