I find it extremely odd there are hardly any mentions of one of the literal biggest and oldest players in this field - Siemens Energy.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like Reddit has a grudge against older established companies, and expects some new techy company to overtake them overnight. I really do not find this to be the case in this industry. For instance, a company like Siemens Energy has almost one hundred billion in backlog. Meaning, they have secure revenue streams for decades to come thanks to their long term service programs for their technologies. So again, I don&#39;t see them vanishing seemingly overnight because some young stud from california invents something they haven&#39;t. There&#39;s a good chance they might just buy it.</p>\n\n<p>The company just spun off into the only &quot;pure play&quot; energy company in the world, traded publicly. Unlike their primary competition, GE, they are not in financially troubling times, and have plenty of cash to do what they are aiming to do - reimagine themselves as a pure green energy company. They are the only company offering <strong>today</strong> conversions of gas fired plants to hydrogen fire (eliminating emissions), offer one of the biggest batteries in the world (through Fluence technology), have the largest installed fleet of wind turbines worldwide (Siemens Gamesa), and are on the leading technical edge for smart building, infrastructure, and grid stabilization projects.</p>\n\n<p>And yet...their stock price does hardly anything. Definitely did not benefit from the pump and dump nature other tech stocks have seen in the last 12 months. I just want to understand why?</p>\n\n<p>Edit to answer some common questions: SMEGF is ticker. Other tickets as well OTC around the world as it’s primarily traded on German stock exchange.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
