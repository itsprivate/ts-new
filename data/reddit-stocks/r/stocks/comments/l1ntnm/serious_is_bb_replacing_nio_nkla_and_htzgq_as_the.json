Yes, they seem to have a huge breakthrough just about to happen. Yes, they actually have an announcement or two. Yes, people have gotten excited and rushed in. But in nearly each case, the talk fizzled out and investors were left holding bags (hmm, yet to see what happens long term with NIO, but the rest still holds).</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m wondering if $BB is following in these footsteps. The price jumps seem so OTT in comparison to what they&#39;ve actually announced. Nearly 100% in a week, 52 week highs, highs not seen for 2.5 years?!</p>\n\n<p>What do others think about this? Is this just irrational exuberance by the market, or Pumpers, or Robinhooders looking for the next rocket to the moon? Or, do they really have something amazing buried underneath all the hype, and if so, what is it (with numbers, not just talk)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
