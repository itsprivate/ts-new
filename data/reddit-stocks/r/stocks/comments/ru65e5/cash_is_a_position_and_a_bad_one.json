Bonds (except maybe Junk Bonds) are basically the same as cash when looking at inflation.\n\nI write this article because it seems that 95% of investors have another opinion, I am a contrarian here.\n\nCash is a position; and a dangerous one. The main problem is of course that security investments are always compared to cash, even measured in cash. But cash can be more volatile than securities. Cash may be created by central banks, by banks and even by every person just writing a debt on a piece of paper. But this is not the subject of this post.\n\nEverybody needs cash, it is so practical. Without it you would need to exchange goods for goods, which could be a pain in the ass. True. Money has two purposes: facilitate exchange of goods and keep values. Now, money is not very good at keeping value. So the best you can do with it is exchange it for goods.\n\nSometimes you may read something like \"a lot of our money is debt\". That is true, even worse, all of our money is debt. And it is almost guaranteed to lose value.\n\nSo what can we do? I cannot speak for other people, but I can describe what I do: As money is debt, somebody owes me. So I try to create debt for myself to balance that out. I usually take a margin loan with my broker for every cent I have in my purse or in my bank accounts. That debt is covered by dividend stocks that at the moment pay more dividends then I have to pay interest.\n\nNow the second argument that one hears in favour of cash: the market may crash and you can use it to buy stocks then. That is a valued argument, but what happens during the time you have to wait for such an event to occur? You lose double, money decreases in value and you lose the opportunity to gain money in other investments.\n\nSo what do I do? I am always invested 100%. When the market dips 20% or more I wait for signs of recovery, than buy on margin, if possible stocks that pay more dividends than I have to pay interest. Then I pay down the debt with the dividends and some partial sales when the market reaches a top again.\n\nIn my early days as an investor there was a saying \"divide your investments: your age in bonds, the rest in stocks\". I don't like that, liquid stocks are easier to cash-in then bonds. And bonds are almost guaranteed to lose money now.\n\nHope I could give some of you a different perspective.\n\nWish you all a happy and successful new year!",
