After dropping steeply in the morning, stocks reversed sharply higher to close the day in the green as market participants look ahead to a busy week of earnings and new commentary by the Federal Reserve. \n\n**Markets Today (low of the day to closing price)**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -3.72% to +0.42%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -4.75% to +0.46%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -3.03% to +0.43%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.72% to +2.30%\n* Volatility Index (VIX):  +18.71% to 2.24%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): -10.31% to -0.01%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -9.21% to -1.47%\n* Apple (AAPL): -4.58% to -0.49%\n* Shopify (SHOP): -11.45% to +6.39%\n* Goldman Sachs (GS): -4.82% to -0.15%\n\nThis year has not been kind to stocks so far, with expectations for tighter monetary conditions by the Federal Reserve causing the 10-year Treasury yield to spike to spike to its highest level in two years, sparking volatility in technology and growth stocks which greatly benefited from easy financial conditions since 2022. With inflation persisting at a higher level than originally expected, members of the Fed are now calling for three to four interest rate hikes next year, with the earliest projected for March 2022. \n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed is set to have its January monetary policy meeting and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, which is expected to produce no changes to existing policy. However, as the Fed looks in to rein rising inflation, the meeting will likely set the stage for the Fed to indicate the potential timeline for an interest rate hike. \n\nNicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note to clients “Until we get a further selloff in risk assets, the Fed will simply not be convinced that raising interest rates and reducing the size of its balance sheet in 2022 will more likely cause a recession rather than a soft landing. Either outcome would dampen inflation, of course, which is why 10-year Treasury yields have stopped climbing. But only a soft landing would allow public companies to continue to post strong earnings. The risk of a hard landing is why U.S. large caps are under so much stress.\"\n\nAs of the start of the week, only about 13% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported quarterly results, according to Goldman Sachs. And so far, one trend that has begun to emerge has been relatively weak commentary about the outlook for this year. \n\nDavid Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “Investors are very interested in forward-looking guidance from management, and recent information on that front has been concerning. Bank executives emphasized higher operating costs in the coming year. Following the release of 4Q results, only six companies in the S&amp;P 500 provided formal near-term guidance for 1Q 2022. Unfortunately, five of the six firms guided below consensus for next quarter, including three of the stocks that actually beat expectations in Q4.\" \n\nLooking ahead, a number of large-cap stocks are set to report earnings results this week, offering investors a view into how companies are holding up amid surging Omicron cases, rising inflation, and a tight labor market. Here are some of the earnings I will be paying close attention to:\n\n**Tuesday:** Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), Microsoft (MSFT), Capital One (COF), Texas Instruments (TXN)\n\n**Wednesday:** Boeing (BA), Abbott (ABT), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), Lam Research (LRCX), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), ServiceNow (NOW)\n\n**Thursday:** Mastercard (MA), McDonald’s (MCD), Apple (AAPL), Robinhood (HOOD), Visa (V), Western Digital (WDC), Atlassian (TEAM), Valero (VLO)\n\n**Friday:** Chevron (CVX), Caterpillar (CAT), Weyerhaeuser (WY)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* IHS Markit's preliminary January services purchasing managers index (PMI) slid to 50.9 from December's 57.6. This marked the lowest level in about 18 months. Readings above the neutral level of 50.0 indicate expansion in a sector. Meanwhile, the institution's manufacturing PMI also fell in January to a 15-month low, reaching 55.0 compared to December's 57.7.\n* AT&amp;T (T) is reportedly rolling out the fastest consumer broadband offered by major internet providers\n* Tesla Inc on Monday fought back against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co over a disputed bond contract, countersuing the bank for seeking a \"windfall\" following Elon Musk's notorious 2018 tweet that he might take his electric car company private. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Tesla accused JPMorgan of \"bad faith and avarice\" for demanding $162.2 million after the bank had unilaterally changed the terms of warrants it received when Tesla sold convertible bonds in 2014.\n* Meta Platforms (FB) said on Monday that its research team has built a new artificial intelligence supercomputer that it thinks will be the fastest in the world when completed in mid-2022.\n* Texas and the District of Columbia sued Alphabet Inc's Google on Monday over what he called deceptive location tracking practices that invade users’ privacy.\n* Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz is teaming up with self-driving sensor maker Luminar Technologies Inc. (LAZR) to pursue fully-automated driving \n* China cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points. The home mortgage rate was also cut by 5 basis points. Following the lending rate cuts, shares of U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies traded mostly higher in Hong Kong on Thursday, lifting the benchmark Hang Seng Index to its highest level in almost two months\n\n“Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.\" -*Ralph Waldo Emerson*",
