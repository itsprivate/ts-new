First off, housekeeping - $BB seems to have decoupled from the meme stock grouping today. Yay. But if you’re watching the ticker you might want to get checked out for paperhanditis, as <strong>$BB gang = long haul gain</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yesterday somebody asked whether I had anything bad to say about $BB. The answer is no, as I am balls deep in $BB and like the stock. <strong><em>However</em></strong> - I am an intellectually honest $BB shill.</p>\n\n<p>So here are some recent concerns and thoughts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) Ford just partnered with Android to</strong> <a href=\"https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google\">replace QNX in its vehicles</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unit economics for QNX aren’t public so unclear how this would impact $BB financials. In addition, the release states they’re targeting new vehicles w/ Android on the road in 2023. (1) I can’t even count that high and (2) knowing ford if they say 2023 it’ll be 2025</li>\n<li>People still don’t really understand QNX. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoj02/bb_qnx_microkernel_cybersecurity_bull_case/\">Read this technical outlay.</a> QNX is in<a href=\"https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/connected-autonomous-vehicles/_jcr_content/main/par/section/par/picture.coreimg.jpeg/1606404570309/car-diagram-update.jpeg\">all parts of the</a> car, especially in functions where security and safety are crucial. Android is replacing the dashboard infotainment console, frankly for good reason b/c Ford Sync sucks and Google Maps is world-class - IN addition, <a href=\"http://www.qnx.com/news/pr_5602_1.html\">QNX actually platforms for Android app</a>s (additional mitigant - it&#39;s not necessarily a zero sum game)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2) CFO sold all of his shares, and some other executives sold as well</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People often don’t understand executive comp and how they think. Jack and Jill have expensive private school and your wife&#39;s been eyeing that new bag. Equity is a big part of your comp, and sometimes you neeed to liquidate that comp b/c b/c Hermes doesn&#39;t taken $BB as legal tender (though they should if you ask me. ).</li>\n<li>Let&#39;s look at Steve Rai (CFO) . <a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001070235-20-000036/\">He apparently sold 33k shares, but as of last fiscal year he had &gt; 90k unearned / unvested unveste</a>d. Corp execs don&#39;t get all their comp @ once - (1) It vests with tenure, and (2) gets earned w/ performance. In otherwords, <strong>Steve didn&#39;t sell all his exposure</strong> to Blackberry - He sold the shares <strong>he had in hand</strong>, and from his perspective a significant part of his personal &quot;net worth&quot; is still exposed to equity comp from the Company that will vest and be earned over time. <strong><em>In the investing world, that&#39;s called skin in the game.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Most importantly, John &quot;Papa&quot; Chen sold</strong> <strong><em>none</em></strong> <strong>of his shares during the craziness last week and has c</strong><a href=\"https://financialpost.com/investing/blackberry-ceo-chen-gets-128-million-award-to-continue-revival\">ontinually taken his bonuses as equity</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3) Growthinvestor123 you’re a fool  and your comps are wrong - $BB may not be a phone company any more but the other highly-valued endpoint security / cyber businesses are just way better and not appropriate to compare to $BB</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blackberry-ltd-stock-outperforms-market-on-strong-trading-day-01612474305-f6c47111fc33?link=MW_latest_news\">No</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ok. With those out the way, here are are some other things I am scared of, in no particular order -</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Company misses earnings - $BB&#39;s mentioned weakness in new customer signings when Covid started, esp. from automotive. While it’s true that everyone put major purchases on hold, the resultant bounceback across industry should show up in the numbers next quarter…hopefully</li>\n<li>A major security breach involving SPark or QNX eroding trust in the Company’s security / safety pipeline</li>\n<li>A bunch of flightly monkeys jump back onto $BB train which in the short term creates a rally but exacerbate volatility and continues to reinforce the notion that $BB is a meme stock.</li>\n<li>John Papa Chen goes skiing and falls off a chairlift - (but he won&#39;t, because he strikes me as a <a href=\"http://cdn02.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M1vJyN8T.jpg\">steady-eddy, safety-first f</a>ella)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>TLDR – There is no TLDR because if you’re a serious investor and not just a monkey looking to jump onto the next train you should read the whole post. Don’t listen to me I’m just a ‘tard and not a financial advisor. After all, I bought short dated OTM calls on Tootsie rolls b/c somebody convinced me the potential meme to earnings ratio was off the hook.</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
