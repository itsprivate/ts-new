He's been the CEO for 30 or 40 years. \n\nIts only activity seems to be its 8% ownership of Checkers and Rally's stock. It might also own a cement company, but it's hard to tell, because it hasn't filed a 10-K since 2004. \n\n**Buck Hill Falls (BUHF):** Buying this stock is sort of like buying an HOA membership without actually living there. The company owns a planned community in rural Pennsylvania, and spends all of its profits on maintaining the golf course, etc. It's possibly never paid a dividend in the entire time it's been in existence, which is over a century. \n\nThe best-case scenario for a shareholder (or at least a non-resident shareholder) would be the sale of the community to another company.
