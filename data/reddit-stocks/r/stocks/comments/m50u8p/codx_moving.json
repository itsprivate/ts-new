Dropped with the market from over $20 a few weeks ago, finally began moving again and started squeezing out the shorts this week after they announced a partnership with Walgreens for their new patented rapid-covid saliva tests. </p>\n\n<p>Also- $CODX has earnings in a few weeks and it’s from the best quarter ever thanks to the sales of the other covid tests they sell. Shorts are beginning to cover which shot it up 20% from last weeks opening price. Last I saw though about 90% of shorts still haven’t covered yet. </p>\n\n<p>Earnings is estimated the last week of March so I purchased about 75 of the 4/16 $30 calls for about $.70, crazy how cheap they are! Also picked up a few $29 and $30 calls for 3/19 for fun on Friday, paid $.10. All on top of my 175 shares. </p>\n\n<p>Definitely check it out! I’ve been holding my 175 shares since $8 in January and I’m not selling till at least $40!</p>\n\n<p>Per usual I am not a financial advisor so do with this as you wish 😇</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
