The proposals are also intended to boost the still-struggling economy, and by confronting climate change, 10 million clean energy jobs could be created if the proposal is successful.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts,&quot; Biden&#39;s website states. </p>\n\n<p>The climate was also high up on the agenda during the confirmation hearing of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday. <strong>Yellen told lawmakers that Biden&#39;s infrastructure plan will involve investing in clean technology, renewable energy, promoting electric vehicle usage, and creating jobs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Climate change is a critical problem facing the country, and President-elect Biden is committed to a wide range of policies to address it,&quot; Yellen said at the hearing. &quot;And in the process, making sure that in doing that we create good jobs for American workers.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Yellen also said that Biden is in &quot;full support&quot; of restoring full incentives for electric vehicles, along with ensuring workers have the skills to succeed in the electric vehicle industry.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Democratic lawmakers support federal spending for combating climate change. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in Yellen&#39;s hearing that he hopes to advance a bill that will prioritize clean energy, clean transportation and energy conservation - efforts that address the &quot;existential threat&quot; of the warming climate.</p>\n\n<p>Given the partisan nature of climate proposals over recent years, whether Biden can carry out costly climate initiatives is uncertain, but Yellen remains clear that it will be a priority, and will benefit the economy through job creation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
