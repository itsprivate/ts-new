Analysts were expecting sales of $126.4 billion, according to Refinitiv.\n\nAmazon has been contending with higher costs, as pandemic-driven expansion left the company with an overhang of too many workers and too much warehouse capacity.\n\n“Despite continued inflationary pressures in fuel, energy, and transportation costs, we’re making progress on the more controllable costs we referenced last quarter, particularly improving the productivity of our fulfillment network,” CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.\n\nAmazon [recorded](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/amazon-records-tk-billion-loss-on-rivian-holding-in-second-quarter.html) a $3.9 billion loss on its Rivian investment after shares of the electric vehicle maker plunged 49% in the second quarter ended June 30. That resulted in a total net loss of $2 billion, and brings its loss for the year to $11.5 billion on the Rivian investment.\n\nBecause of the Rivian writedown, analyst estimates varied dramatically, making it difficult to compare actual results to a consensus number.\n\nAmazon’s ad business is a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy quarter for online advertising, and shows the company is picking up share in one of its fastest-growing businesses.\n\nAd revenue climbed 18% in the period. Facebook, meanwhile, recorded its first ever drop in revenue this week, and forecast another decline for the third quarter. At Alphabet, advertising growth slowed to 12%, and YouTube showed a dramatic deceleration to 4.8% from 84% a year earlier.\n\nAmong the other top tech companies, Microsoft also reported disappointing results this week. Apple [beat on the top and bottom lines](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/apple-aapl-earnings-q3-2022.html), lifting the stock in after-hours trading.\n\n[link](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/amazon-amzn-q2-2022-earnings.html)",
