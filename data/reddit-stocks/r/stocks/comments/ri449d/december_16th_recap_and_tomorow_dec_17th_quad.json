Wait not so fast! \n-Pre market was about the only excitement that bulls saw today. Immediately after opening she started to bleed. \n-About 1pm i could tell the day was gonna be solidified in red... we broke the 1 hour bollinger mid band at 469.71 (lower band sits near 461.7 and will act as support and most like tomorrow will be our bottom during the quad witching day). We closed  candle below the 1 hour 20 day EMA despite a MACD buy signal and neutral but downward curled RSI of 48 which gave room for more downside. The 1 hour 200 day ema sat at 465.58. On the daily we had established a clear resistance line started back on the 7th. We generally see a rejection and retracement to the daily 20 day EMA which sat near 464.94. The daily MACD was still a buy but very neutral RSI of 55 with a slight downward trend. The upper bollinger on the daily was 476.62 which we failed to reach (not by much this morning though) and our mid was 464.37 which would see bottom support. \n-I had all expectations we would dip near 465 and played it that way. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/LHZOJYQ.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hFXCHur.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rtaVgax.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1hMhaBQ.jpeg \n\nDAILY POSITIONS RECAP\n-Overall had the best day trading ive ever had so far. I threw a few Ford options in there too but mostly played the nice downward channel we had formed with very clear support and resistance lines. I played the support and resistance bounces with jumping from call to put when i saw a rejection on either side.\nOverall profit of $1600. Not bad! Had picked up a few calls for next week on the cheaper side. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/NgoFe4K.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YyhC46h.jpeg \n\nNEXT DAY ANTICIPATION \n-bear target: $460\n-Bull target: $470 \n\nAFTERMARKET\n-Aftermarket initially confirmed the downward channel and over all strong resistance line only to see us break it. We were up about 0.1% but are trending downward currently sitting at -0.04%. Looks like we will dip back into that channel. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/HDIZSdt.jpeg \n\n1 HOUR RSI\n-relatively neutral RSI sitting at 43. Trend line is very flat. Leaves a little room for some more downside and plenty of upside there. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/HDIZSdt.jpeg \n\n1 HOUR MACD\n-still a solid sell signal and a downward trend\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HDIZSdt.jpeg \n\n1 HOUR BOLLINGER\n-Upper limit 475, mid limit 470, low limit 464. \n-I suspect our trading range tomorrow to be between this 464 and 470 range. However, that lower band limit just curled sharply downward opening up further downside. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/9WSluvO.jpeg \n\n1 HOUR EMA\n- 200 day EMA is sitting at 465. Currently after hours is using this as support. However we broke that 200 day EMA with a wic earlier today. EMA 50 day sits at 467.7 and 20 day EMA sits near 468.4. I if we can close a candle above 468.4 we may see a reversal back towards ATH. A candle closed below 465 indicates more downside ahead. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/wfzHjDe.jpeg \n\nDAILY RSI\n-We are riding semi neutral around 52 however we do see a small downward trend. Plenty of downside available and upside. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/oPYR3Ov.jpeg \n\nDAILY MACD\n-overall MACD is very indecisive with a buy signal. However its very flat and quickly could be swayed either way\nhttps://i.imgur.com/oPYR3Ov.jpeg \n\nDAILY BOLLINGER\n-upper of 476 (we nearly reached it today!), mid at 464.25 and low at 452. We closed above this mid today but the last two days candles were partially closed below. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/AI8xU53.jpeg \n\nDAILY EMA\n-20 day EMA held up as support today at 464.5. However as you can see looking at the bottom of the two wics from earlier this week we have another bottom support line that runs parallel to the 50 day EMA of 459.32\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3DhfRRo.jpeg \n\nDAILY CHANNEL\n-this is always my favorite part to zoom out and look what is the overall trend. We are stuck dead in the middle and truthfully no indication of up or down. Sentiment says upper limit will be reached first though. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/KYxhcfp.jpeg \n\nDAILY/ WEEKLY NEWS\n-Tomorrow is the quad witching day! For those of you not familiar it is: \n-Quadruple witching (also called \"quad witching\") refers to the third Friday of every March, June, September and December. On these days, derivatives (e.g. market index futures, options futures, stock options, stock futures) expire, usually resulting in increased volatility.\n-Quad witching hour- The last hour of these trading days (between 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. EST)  is referred to as the quadruple witching hour\n-Quadruple witching days are usually accompanied by considerable stock and derivative price volatility, as well as increased trading volume. As a result, investors can anticipate and plan for the potential effects of these relatively turbulent trading days.\n-I did a little back testing and found this: \nSept 17 -3.3%\nJune 18 -2.3%\nMarch 19 -1.4%\nDec 18 2020 -1.5%\nSept 18 2020 -2.7% \nJune 19 2020 -3.2% \nMarch 20 2020 -10.5%\n-So on average for 2021 Spy dropped 2.33% and on average in 2020 it dropped 2.46% (if we exclude March which we know the market was in a major downturn anyways). So for 2020 and 2021 on average we have consistently seen a drop of 2.395%. \n\nNEXT DAY POSITIONS/ ANTICIPATION\n-Based on the one hour low band bollinger of 464, one hour 200 day EMA of 465, daily mid bollinger band of 464, and daily 20 day EMA of 464.5 i suspect that will be where the fight happens. It is very heavy support. I see a clear trend line that i will be watching for it to be broken. If we break and close a candle on the one hour below 464 than i fully anticipate a retest of around 461 (a support line touched on the 14th and 15th lies right here). I could easily see this holding as support for the anticipated quad witching day sell off. If we do see a retracement below 464-465 i suspect us to turn it into resistance \n-If we see any candles close below 461 then the bottom will be 454. We have a support line from 10/4, 10/6 and 12/3 that intersects here. In addition daily lower bollinger band is 452 which would be perfect support. \n-overall for me tomorrow i am anticipating a dip and that puts will be the play. However i am only holding calls going into tomorrow. I picked up a Jan 21 468C and 470C today for NEXT WEEK. If we do see the significant sell off tomorrow to near 460 i will pick up some 463C and 465C for Jan 21 also. Also holding a Ford Jan 21 21C. \n-I expect tomorrow to be bloody but i fully expect a recovery starting monday. The quad witching is pretty much the last \"negative\" event that we will see till the end of the year. I do think we could see ATH and even as high as 480 by the end of year.",
