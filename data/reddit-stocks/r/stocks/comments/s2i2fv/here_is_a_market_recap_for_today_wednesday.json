  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 12, 2022**\n\nStocks rose on Wednesday despite a new report on inflation coming out this morning, which showed the fastest rate of increase in consumer prices since 1982. The inflation report comes the day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testified before Congress and said the Central Bank was ready to step in to stop inflation. \n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.28%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.41%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.13%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.78%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -3.48%\n* 10-Year Treasury yield: 1.737%\n* Tesla (TSLA): +3.97%\n* Alibaba (BABA): +4.24%\n* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM): +2.39%\n* Nio (NIO) +5.56%\n* CrowdStrike (CRWD): -4.15%\n\nWednesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics December Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices for consumer goods rose 7.0% year-over-year, the fastest pace of inflation since 1982. CPI matched consensus estimates and showed a minor acceleration compared to November 6.8% print.\n\nBy category, prices for used cars and trucks and shelter were the largest contributors to the headline increase. The used cars and trucks index rose for a third straight month and accelerated to a 3.5% month-on-month rise in December from November's 2.5% increase. This index was also higher by a marked 37.3% compared to the same month last year. Shelter prices rose 0.4%.  \n\nThe core measure of consumer price changes, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 5.5% in December over last year, representing the fastest increase since 1991. This accelerated from a 4.9% annual gain in November.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)\n\nIan Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said “December’s increase to 7.0% ... likely is not quite the peak which we think will be about 7.2% in January and February, but the run of big increases is over, and it will start to fall in March. By September, we look for 4-1/2%.\" If we do not see inflation begin to moderate in the next two, three months, expect the Fed to step in to more aggressively raise the interest rate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Powell gave his confirmation hearing before Congress, in which he said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.\n\nHe said, “As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we’ll be normalizing policy, meaning we’re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we’ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that’s just the road to normalizing policy.”\n\nPowell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, “If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.”\n\nThe Fed’s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, “We can affect the demand side, we can’t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.”\n\nBrian Belski, Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets said, “I think the biggest comment on most investors' minds that we talk to around the world would be a 'policy mistake' that the Fed might be too aggressive. Mr. Powell basically came out today and said this is going to be a process ... with respect to how long this is going to take, and I think that's what's calming investors.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The XLF, the ETF tracking banks that are members of the SPY hit a new intraday record total, the fourth new record in the last eight sessions. \n* The U.S. Medicare program's proposal to severely limit coverage of new Alzheimer's treatments including Biogen's Aduhelm threatens to hurt sales of the drug, which has proven controversial. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), which runs the government health plan for people over age 65, said it would cover Aduhelm, and similar treatments, only for patients enrolled in approved clinical trials.\n* Tesla Inc sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Tuesday.\n* Microsoft Corp hired a key Apple Inc engineer Mike Filippo, who worked in the development of Apple’s in-house chip, to design its own in-house server chips, according to a report by Bloomberg. The cloud computing heavy-weight relies heavily on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc to supply chips for its Azure cloud computing services as well as Surface PCs.\n* Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz plans to start assembling the electric version of its flagship S-Class sedan, the EQS, in India.\n* California is reevaluating Tesla Inc's Full Self-Driving (FSD) test program, to determine if the electric-car maker's software should fall under its motor vehicle department's autonomous vehicle regulations, the Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday.\n* NVIDIA (NVDA) was voted the best company to work for, according to GlassDoor,  a website where current and former employees anonymously review companies. NVDA received a rating of 4.6 out of 5. This marks the eighth time the company has found itself on Glassdoor's list. By comparison, the average rating of the nearly 2 million employers reviewed on the website is 3.7.\n\n*\"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\"* \\-Eleanor Roosevelt",
