Last year during the march-may selloff in 2021, this dude said in an interview that the crash has started, and then the S&amp;P 500 went on to close +26.89% for the year. If you followed this guys advice and held cash in 2010, waiting for his prediction to come true, you'd have waited for about 8-10 years on the sidelines until the market had a selloff in late 2018, or when Covid19 crashed the stock market in 2020. By then you'd have lost much more money on the sidelines, than if you'd just let your money grow in the market throughout all those years. Even if you had just listened to his advice last year during the march selloff and sold, then you'd lose out on being up +26.89% if you'd have invested in the indexes instead of listening to him.\n\nAgain stop giving these clowns attention, if the market doesn't crash this year and it starts recovering and people get their confidence back in the market, and we have another rally, this dude will say that the market will crash next year, and if that doesn't happen, he'll say it will crash in 2024, and so on and on and on. Let's rememeber somethings everybody gets taught the moment they start investing: You can't time the market, you can't predict what the market will do, time in the market beats timing the market.",
