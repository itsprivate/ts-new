Instead, you should look at the company's earnings and collect it like a landlord would their rents — with the expectation that the earnings will one day be greater than the amount you invested.\n\nThe second post details how companies with moats make more money than other companies and hence why they're better investments. I shared a simple, three-step process to identify companies with moats and stressed the correlation between companies with strong moats and **Owner's earnings,** a metric Warren Buffett created and uses to value companies himself. Unfortunately, Owner's earnings is not a standardized metric and is not provided in the financial statements. It can however be calculated.\n\nMany of you responded with very encouraging and kinds words. Thank you❤️. In that same vein, I made a spreadsheet based on these concepts that can and hopefully will help you and retail investors alike become better long-term value investors.\n\n*For those of you unfamiliar with* [*Owner's earnings*](https://stablebread.com/how-to-calculate-and-analyze-warren-buffetts-owners-earnings/)*, I will be making a post on this shortly for those of you who wanted me to delve into it more. For now, just know that it represents how much cash falls into the business owner’s pockets. Basically it is the amount of cash you’re left with after you spend on whatever you need to to maintain, but not grow, the business and is a more realistic and accurate portrayal of a company's intrinsic value than EPS, Operating Cash or FCF.*\n\n## What does this spreadsheet do?\n\nThis spreadsheet puts you in the position of a **business owner**, who collects the earnings of their companies on a regular basis. When you own a share you own a part of the business and therefore receive a part of its profits. It does so by automatically tracking and accumulating your **Owner’s earnings** your shares. All you got to do is input your transactions — ticker symbol, date purchased, number of shares purchased, and share price.\n\nInstead of showing you your total portfolio value or day-to-day share price, which is not only irrelevant to long-term investing (mostly), but also suboptimal insofar as it can evoke volatile emotions and trigger poor decisions, this spreadsheet chiefly displays the Owner’s earnings of the businesses and shares you own.\n\n## How will it make you a better long-term investor?\n\nThis spreadsheet and the formula behind it have been meticulously designed to make you a better long-term investor. The formula is as follows:\n\n    Your earnings = Owner's earnings per share * number of shares you own * days held/period \n\nTo maximize your earnings, you must maximize each of its components. In doing so, you will have achieved the holy grail of long-term value investing:\n\n**1. Invest in great companies with wide moats**\n\nTo maximize owner’s earnings you must invest in great companies with wide moats that can and will grow their earnings at a high rate for many years into the future. You don't want a company whose earnings stay the same year after year, you want a company that can grow as fast as possible for as long as possible.\n\n**2. Buy stocks at a discount instead of panicking when it falls**\n\nTo maximize the number of shares you own you must hunt for value and bargains. You have a limited amount of money to invest so you naturally want to buy as many shares (or earnings) as you can with that money. If two similar companies make $10 a year, one of them selling for $50 a share and the other $25 a share, you're going to go for the one selling for $25 (assuming equal growth rates) because you can buy $20 worth of earnings for the same amount of money. In other words, you want to grow your earnings as efficiently as possible.\n\n**3. Hold on to companies for the long run and compound your money**\n\nTo maximize days held you must hold onto your shares for as long as possible. The logic behind this is simple: Each day you hold on to a stock, the more money you make. If you hold a stock for a year, you make 100% of its owner’s earnings for that year for every share you owned. If you own it for 6 months you get 50% of its earnings. The longer you hold onto a stock, the more earnings you accumulate, and the more your money compounds.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThis spreadsheet is an improved, more automatic, and intuitive adaption from a solution I've been using myself and it's helped me become a more calm, collected, rational investor. Without it I would not have had as much fun finding great companies with strong earnings potential, nor would I have held onto them for as long as I have. In other words, it has made me a much more successful long-term investor and I hope it can do the same for you.\n\nHeres a copy of the spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dkoTDNG\\_JWeYP-\\_GJNW8f\\_MVXfDbSWyZPlfTRo28OUM/edit#gid=2052305304](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dkoTDNG_JWeYP-_GJNW8f_MVXfDbSWyZPlfTRo28OUM/edit#gid=2052305304)\n\n*Looking forward to your feedback, comments, criticisms* 🙂",
