Much has been said about employers having trouble finding qualified workers recently, and it has been attributed to the pandemic, unemployment benefits, and working age adults switching careers or quitting their jobs entirely. Demographically, however, all of this ignores the elephant in the room.\n\nAnyone who’s a millennial has probably heard at a young age that “tons of jobs will open up once all the baby boomers retire.” Well, guess what? That’s happening right now, in addition to all the ramifications of a global pandemic and a collective reevaluation of our purpose in life.\n\nAll this is to say, we have hit peak boomer. And all the baby boomer stock BUYERS are soon going to become stock SELLERS.\n\nI listened to Mad Money last Wednesday, and Jim Cramer had his “Are You Diversified?” segment where people call in and ask him about their top 5 holdings. This Hank Hill sounding guy calls in and said his top stocks are Southern Company (SO), Verizon (VZ), ConocoPhillips (COP), Phillip Morris (PM), and Union Pacific (UNP). These are not stocks I would own, except maybe UNP, and I don’t see anyone here ever talk about them. But I am younger and can understand why someone his age and demographic would own these.\n\nMy point is, while boomer stocks are widely acclaimed right now due to impending interest rate hikes, I posit that these stocks will soon face long-term secular *outflows* that will continue throughout the Millennial generation’s working years. Furthermore, when some Millennials ultimately inherit their boomer parents' and grandparents' stocks (with the all-important step-up in cost basis), how many Millennials are going to hοdl grandpa’s ConocoPhillips stock when they could instantly diversify or invest in literally anything else tax-free?\n\nTl;dr: Baby boomers are retiring and boomer stocks will be sold off like the dickens. Long tech, long growth, ignore the noise.",
