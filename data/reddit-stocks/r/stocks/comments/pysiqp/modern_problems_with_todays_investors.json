Get fear whenever you experience a red day/week.\n\nA **proper Investment** means, your money is locked technically for at least 3-5yrs.. imagine if you didn’t have the visibility to either touch or view your investment and only had access to it after 5yrs. Even if you decide to hold it for the short term and sell at a relatively small profit you will end up paying short gains taxes (US specific).\n\nI get everyone has different investing strategies. However, if you invest in a company it should be because you believe it will grow and be successful in the near future. The best course of action here is to look at the company's finances i.e. will this company survive for 5 quarters more without doing a share dilution? , is their revenue growing or expected to grow in the near future? cashflow? etc. In addition, you should research their management as it arranges the factors of production, assembles and organizes the resources, integrates the resources in an effective manner to achieve goals, etc. \n\nThere are other business-related questions that you should research i.e will their market share increase, will their customer base increase by expanding its product/service range, expanding their operations or is there an expectation for the demand of their product/service to increase in the future? etc. These questions are just a few of many that you should ask yourself before investing in one company. \n\nEye strain- This one is very important. Please stop looking at the charts or your brokerage account 24/7 because it's simply a waste of time. This is also dangerous for you as when there is a drop in price it encourages you to sell reacting to market conditions. Set a stop-loss order if you are too worried the share price will fall below your average price. (Unless you’re a day trader)\n\nTaking advice from random people- I’ve been in this and other stock specific subs for years and always read comments from newbies asking and even taking advice from others. Sometimes their advice might be right; however sometimes they aren’t. The chances of them having a bad experience and losing money with the stock you are discussing is high. Be aware and do your research. I have seen too many cases of people taking advice from others and losing large amounts of money in the sub we aren’t supposed to talk about that starts with an W.\n\nBad Timing- Stop going all-in whenever a company announces a new catalyst (event) or has great news because by the time the market opens the news will be already priced in, just for it to fall down in the afternoon because it's overvalued. This is how hedge funds take advantage of you.\n\nFinally and most importantly, never ever buy stocks on margin, you will end up in a massive pile of debt increasing in interest every day that you won’t be able to ever repay..\n\nThere is a reason banks & brokerages lend you money, use only what you can afford.. \n\nThanks for reading.
