The general perception among Asian oil traders is that the situation is \"quite complicated,\" one trader told Energy Intelligence on Thursday.\n\nThe latest round of sanctions against Russia—latest as of late Thursday—continues to allow energy trade and bank settlements for energy flows and does not cut off Russia from the SWIFT global banking system",
