It also found that the majority of chip manufacturing facilities are operating at or above 90% capacity, and that the median demand for chips was as much as 17% higher in 2021 than in 2019. The available supply isn’t increasing enough to match demand.\n\n“With sky-rocketing demand and full utilization of existing manufacturing facilities, it’s clear the only solution to solve this crisis in the long-term is to rebuild our domestic manufacturing capabilities,” Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a news release.\n\nThe report found bottlenecks in specific semiconductor inputs and applications, including legacy logic chips used in products like cars and medical devices; analog chips used in power management, image sensors, and radio frequency; and optoelectronics chips for sensors and switches. The survey also found bottlenecks in wafer production, which lacks an apparent short-term solution.\n\nBarron’s highlighted the far-reaching implications of chip shortages in a May 2021 cover story, dubbing the phenomenon “The Everything Shortage.”\n\nRaimondo did point to some signs of improvement, including an announcement from Intel (ticker: INTC) that it planned to invest $20 billion to build a vast chip facility in Ohio, as well as a November announcement from Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) concerning automotive semiconductor partnerships. \n\nStill, Raimondo noted that if a Covid-19 outbreak, a natural disaster, or political instability disrupted a key foreign chip facility for even a few weeks, it could shut down a manufacturing facility in the U.S. In addition, the Commerce Department is looking into reports of unusually high prices for chips sold through brokers.\n\n“Every day we wait is a day we fall further behind,” Raimondo wrote in a blog post summarizing the survey and urging lawmakers to pass the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. A vrsion of the proposed law passed in the Senate last year and would include $52 billion in domestic semiconductor funding.",
