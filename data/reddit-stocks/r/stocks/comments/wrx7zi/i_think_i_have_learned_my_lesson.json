This gave me confidence to be more bold with my investments. After graduating I decided to dedicate more time to learn about stocks. I still stuck with 0% margins and still followed my standard procedure when doing due diligence. I evaluated a company’s balance sheets, determined whether a company is undervalued or overvalued as I moved away from tech stocks and allowed myself to dip into other industries. I believe I had became pretty good at it. I invested in companies like AUPH at $11 and cashed out most of my stocks at ~$25. I bought into NET at $50 which Im still holding and still green on. However, recently BBBY soared up to the 20s. I read what the redditors over at WSB were saying and decided to throw in 15% of my equity into a position at X5 margins into BBBY. Today, the stock has dipped so much that I believe I am going to have to pay off my BBBY position with other positions in my portfolio. \n\nI think I have learned a valuable lesson today.",
