Today I've learned about the Lipstick Effect:*\n\nThe observation really started in the 2001 troubles:\n\n&gt;For  example, in the last great recession (2007-09), sales of cosmetics in  the US jumped by about 5%. Not all cosmetics benefit from the lipstick  effect, and sometimes not even lipstick itself. For example, in the UK  during the last recession, cosmetic sales appeared to be boosted by a  jump in nail varnish demand, rather than lipstick. But the term  'lipstick effect' has stuck ever since Leonard Lauder of Estée Lauder  was credited with coining the term back in 2001, when he noted that his  company's lipstick sales were inversely correlated to the economic  cycle.\n\nWhat we need to know is why does this happen? One narrow explanation is this:\n\n&gt;Now  a series of psychology experiments have confirmed for the first time  that while tougher economic times decrease desire for most items, they  also reliably increase women's yearning for products that boost their  attractiveness.  \nPsychologists contend that this \"lipstick effect\"  is operating largely below conscious awareness of men and women, and  therefore require precise experiments to reveal them. The results  suggest this phenomenon is driven by women's desire to attract mates  with resources.\n\nIf it's that second that is the cause of the effect - and not just women  looking for a rich mate in hard times - then this \"Lippy\" effect has a  much wider reading to it.\n\n&gt;There's also something called \"The Lippy Effect\" which is  derived, of all things, from female behaviour in recessions. This is  that often enough lipstick sales actually go up as those of fashion,  handbags and so on go down. The observation being that we all desire a  little luxury, a little pampering, and if we can't have it on big and  major things then we'll take a little bit of it by buying smaller yet  premium items. It's easy enough to see how this could happen with  spirits. That luxury of better whisky for a few pounds more when the  tens or hundreds of pounds to spend aren't available. As long as things  don't get so bad we're all back to bathtub gin of course.\n\nIf  the Lipstick Effect is in fact substituting affordable luxuries for  those now unaffordable in hard economic times, then those who retail  affordable luxuries might well benefit in hard times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* [https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/consumer-trends/the-shopper-shrink-how-the-lipstick-effect-will-drive-sales-during-the-downturn/648553.article](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/consumer-trends/the-shopper-shrink-how-the-lipstick-effect-will-drive-sales-during-the-downturn/648553.article)\n* [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/slightly-blighty/201510/the-lipstick-effect-how-boom-or-bust-effects-beauty](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/slightly-blighty/201510/the-lipstick-effect-how-boom-or-bust-effects-beauty)",
