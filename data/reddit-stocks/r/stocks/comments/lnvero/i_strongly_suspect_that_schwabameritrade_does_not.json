They&#39;re comfortable doing this, because they probably actually have the shares.

This is a multiple of only 5x.</p>\n\n<p>They give errors for any attempt to put limit sells higher than this. Why are they treating GME limit sells differently from Google? I have a cash account. There should be no share lending going on. The broker should not be at risk for ANY limit I put on the sale of my shares.</p>\n\n<p>The only conclusion I have been able to draw from this is: They must not actually have all of our shares and are limiting their losses. Try it with any other stock: LIMITS ARE 50x, and as far as I can tell, have always been until GME.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: In my cash account:</p>\n\n<p>1) TD allows Google (and many other stocks) limit sell orders to be placed at about 50x the price.</p>\n\n<p>2) GME limit sell orders can be placed at only about 5x the price.</p>\n\n<p>What gives?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
