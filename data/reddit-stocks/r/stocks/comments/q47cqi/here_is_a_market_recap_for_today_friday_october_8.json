The move to the upside earlier in the week came after Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling into early December, helping avoid a catastrophic government default. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.18% lower but the week 1.12% higher, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 0.5% lower but the week 0.69% higher, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day even and the week 1.41% higher.\n\nAfter the first negative month all year, the move higher in equities came after the Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling until early December, preventing a catastrophic government default that would’ve taken place around Oct 18. On Thursday, the chamber voted to raise the debt limit by $480 billion. \n\nWith concerns over a government default dissipating, market participants turned their attention to the latest monthly jobs report from the Labor market, which showed the second consecutive month of payroll gains greatly lagging behind estimates. Non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. \n\nThough employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a \"decent\" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. \n\nFriday's jobs report stood in stark contrast to other, stronger-than-expected data on the state of the labor market in the U.S. New weekly jobless claims came in at their second-lowest since March 2020. Here are the numbers \n\n* **Initial unemployment claims:** 326,000 vs. 348,000 expected and an upwardly revised 364,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims:** 2.714 million vs. 2.766 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.811 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The[ Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday that it reached a deal ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-minimum-corporate-tax-rate-162842722.html)among 136 countries to ensure major companies pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. \"The landmark deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP, will also reallocate more than USD 125 billion of profits from around 100 of the world’s largest and most profitable MNEs to countries worldwide, ensuring that these firms pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate and generate profits,\" the OECD said in a statement\n* Facebook (FB) said some users were once again having trouble accessing its product on Friday, another disruption following the hours-long one earlier this week and another blow to the already beleaguered company. “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products,” Facebook [said in a post](https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1446556732977778695) on Twitter. “We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience.” \n* Elon Musk announced Tesla is moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas. He said that Tesla plans to expand its activities in California but that the company’s ability to scale up in the San Francisco Bay Area is limited.\n* EU antitrust regulators are following up on a complaint by Slack Technologies, which is owned by Salesforce (CRM) by asking Microsoft's rivals if its Teams app integrated with its Office product is anti-competitive. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AON target raised by Wells Fargo from $306 to $321 at Ovoverweight.
