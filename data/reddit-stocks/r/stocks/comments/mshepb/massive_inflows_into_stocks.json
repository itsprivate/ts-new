More money poured into the market during the last five months than in the last twelve years.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/more-money-poured-into-stocks-past-5-months-than-over-last-12-years-bofa-2021-04-09/\">https://www.reuters.com/business/more-money-poured-into-stocks-past-5-months-than-over-last-12-years-bofa-2021-04-09/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Investors  have pumped more money into equities over the past five months than in  the last 12 years, BofA&#39;s weekly flow figures showed on Friday, as  ultra-easy monetary policies and unprecedented stimulus has sparked a  secular shift into stocks.  </p>\n\n<p>BofA  said $576 billion had gone into equity funds in the past five months,  beating the combined $452 billion inflows seen in the last 12 years,  </p>\n\n<p>Based  on clients&#39; asset allocations, Bofa said a record 63.6% of the money  was invested in stocks, 18.5% in debt and 11.6% in cash.  </p>\n\n<p>The  exuberance has however slowed in recent weeks, with investors pouring  $22.7 billion into cash during the week to Wednesday, on top of the  nearly $100 billion committed in the last two weeks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How to play this?  I have no idea.  I tend to believe the market will continue melting up as we see spectacular earnings over the next two quarters, and will probably continue on through the holiday season.  But that unusual amount of inflows underlines the current mania.</p>\n\n<p>Usually I don&#39;t put stops on positions that are bought as long term investments rather than speculative plays, but I am rethinking that.  Stops saved my ass on the S PACs and green stocks/ETFs I had earlier this year.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
