The Tesla CEO also [**launched a Twitter poll**](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-proposes-selling-10-percent-tesla-stock-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) asking whether he should sell 10% of his holdings, citing pressure from US lawmakers who are pushing for a \"[**billionaire tax**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/taxing-billionaires-would-raise-557-billion-elon-musk-billionaire-tax2021-11?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest)\" that would target the ultra-wealthy's unrealized stock gains.\n\nBurry's tweet implies those might just be excuses. The investor of \"The Big Short\" fame and head of Scion Asset Management posted a link to a SEC filing in August, which noted that Musk has pledged about 88 million shares, or 36% of his total stake, as collateral for personal loans as of June 30.\n\nMusk had 41% of his shares pledged as collateral for his debts at the end of December last year, and 48% as of June 30 last year, previous filings show.\n\nBurry appears to be suggesting that Musk isn't eyeing a stock sale in order to feed millions of people, in response to a legislative proposal, or because he could [**face a $10 billion tax bill**](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-options-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) when he exercises a slew of stock options that expire in August 2022.\n\nInstead, Burry's theory is that Musk needs some cash to service the loans he's taken out using his Tesla stock. That practice [**drew heavy scrutiny**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-criticized-avoiding-taxes-deserves-break-philanthropy-lifestyle-loopholes-2021-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) this summer after a [**ProPublica investigation**](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax) detailed how some of the world's wealthiest people borrow against their stock to minimize their tax burdens.\n\n## Bubble fears\n\nBesides tweeting about Musk, Burry marked his return to Twitter with a new [**header image**](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/header_photo). His choice of \"Satire of the Tulip Mania,\" a painting by Jan Brueghel the Younger that ridicules the [**Dutch tulip bubble**](https://www.businessinsider.com/tulipmania-bubble-story-2014-9?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) in the 1600s, is undoubtedly a fresh warning about the current market mania.\n\nThe painting depicts tulip speculators as mindless monkeys, and shows them weighing the bulbs, counting money, taking inventory, and going into debt, fighting over, and even dying for the flowers.\n\nBurry has [**painted**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-tesla-robinhood-bitcoin-gamestop-bubble-2021-3?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) the immense hype around meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, and the frantic buying of Tesla shares and other assets, as clear signs of rampant speculation.\n\nMoreover, Burry has diagnosed a [**historic market bubble**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-warns-stocks-options-dotcom-bubble-crash-2021-9?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) and [**predicted a devastating crash**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) in recent months.
