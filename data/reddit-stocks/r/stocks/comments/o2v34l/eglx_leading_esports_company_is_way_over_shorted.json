I am not an ambulance chaser jumping on struggling companies in hopes that some dumb reddit trend will make me a quick 10%.</p>\n\n<p>But that does not change the facts about what is going on right now. Enthusiast Gaming, the leading eSports organization in North America (<em>as measured social reach, web traffic and revenue</em>) is being shorted to death.</p>\n\n<p>After an epic, fundamentals driven rally from $1 to $8.80, the stock has been beaten down to $6.50.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s very important to note that <strong>the rally was not a senseless meme pump</strong>. The company&#39;s <strong>revenue grew from $15m per year to $127m</strong>. They also announced a litany of high profile fortune 500 and government clients that hired them. The company is not fluff.</p>\n\n<p>If the company is doing okay, then how come it&#39;s down so much? Well the catalyst that kicked off the downtrend was their announcement of share sales. As a newly registered Nasdaq company, they had to file forms with the SEC that would allow them to sell shares over the next 25 months. That process took a few weeks to complete before they could close a deal.</p>\n\n<p>During that time, the shorts have had their way with EGLX. You can see a detailed chart of shorting activity over the past several weeks here:  <a href=\"https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX\">https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX</a></p>\n\n<p>The company has a tiny little market cap and the stock volume has been relatively low. A small number of short sellers have been able to exercise extreme market power over this company.</p>\n\n<p>But now they have overstayed their welcome. They have raised the capital and the financials are sound. The company&#39;s actual business is doing great and the industry will continue booming.</p>\n\n<p>Every single morning since the deal closed, EGLX has tried pumping back up, and then it settles down. But the stock selling pressure is not coming from long term holders giving up their positions. It is coming from short sellers trying to make a quick buck at the expense of a great Canadian company.</p>\n\n<h1>According to this source, short interest was 38% yesterday.</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX\">https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX</a></p>\n\n<p>I am willing to bet the short interest will be even higher on Monday. The stock started popping off this morning and then fell precipitously again.</p>\n\n<p>But how do I know this company isn&#39;t just dog doodoo and shareholders are dumping?</p>\n\n<p>Look at the cost to borrow: <a href=\"https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx\">https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx</a></p>\n\n<h1>This shorting is costing the shorts 9%! Compare that to AMC&#39;s 1.16% and GME&#39;s 0.59% short borrowing cost.</h1>\n\n<p>Get wrecked.</p>\n\n<p>This high cost to borrow means a couple things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is an extremely high number of short sellers compared to people who are willing to lend out their shares. That indicates its over shorted and holders are hodling.</li>\n<li>It also means this is costing them ALOT every day this stock doesn&#39;t go down further.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, if this company was a steaming pile of trash that isn&#39;t making money, I would say the shorts will just kill EGLX and win the day. I do NOT advocate in investing in dying companies in hopes of some bogus short squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>But EGLX will not die. It is genuinely a great long term opportunity, and the bears have gotten ahead of themselves on this one. This company is here to stay, for a number of obvious reasons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reason 1: Common sense:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The eSports and gaming industry is growing and these guys have developed a real business out of it. They are doing business with: TikTok, Samsung, ATVI, EA, President Biden&#39;s Campaign, the US military, Ad Council, Disney, Bell, Nintendo etc etc. What&#39;s more, they are producing results for them. Take a scroll through the luminosity LGLoyal twitch page, and you can see that EGLX has been getting about a million views on every single video with the program they developed with TikTok. TikTok has already indicated they intend to continue to do business with EGLX.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reason 2: They have cash:</strong></p>\n\n<p>They just successfully raised another $44m in cash. Looking at their recent financials, I think that probably puts them around $60m cash in the bank right now. They are not going to run out of liquidity. They are not some business on the verge of bankruptcy, desperate for funding and debt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reason 3: They are NOT overpriced:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In a market where most high volatility growth names like say Palantir, Zoom, BB, Score, Tesla, Dkng etc are all trading at like a 10-50X price to sales ratio, EGLX is sitting at a measly 6.5 price to sales. That is a tad high when you compare it to stable value stocks in the Berkshire portfolio, but honestly it&#39;s PEANUTS for a growth stock in a hot industry that just expanded their revenue ten fold.</p>\n\n<h1>This stock will rubber band back to $10 when these shorts give up.</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
