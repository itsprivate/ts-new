In most of those cases, the broad-market index generated a below-average return over the next one, three, six and 12 months, and it experienced sharper drawdowns in the months following, according to Goldman.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typically when this happens, the trend continues for another four months while momentum “leaders” — stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet — outperform.\n&gt; \n&gt; “Following market breadth declines of the recent magnitude, it has historically taken four additional months before a sustained increase in breadth takes hold and market leadership flips towards the previous laggards,” Kostin said.\n&gt; \n&gt; “Record index concentration is both a cause and a symptom of a narrow market,” he noted. “The market-cap weight of the 10 largest stocks in the index has increased for each of the past seven years and now registers at 31%, the highest level since at least 1980.”\n\nWhat do you think about this \"four months\" number? There aren't that many data points on this. Why wouldn't the winners just keep winning?",
