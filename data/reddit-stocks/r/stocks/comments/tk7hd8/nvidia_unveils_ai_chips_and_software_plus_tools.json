A highly anticipated virtual meeting with analysts was scheduled for after his talk.\n\nAmong other things, Huang unveiled Nvidia’s new “Hopper” chip family, named for the computer-science pioneer Grace Hopper, which succeeds the company’s current Ampere AI chip architecture announced two years ago. The company introduced the H100, a processor with 80 billion transistors, which it calls the “world’s most advanced chip.”\n\nHuang said the chip will be “the engine of the world’s AI infrastructure.” Hopper provides a ninefold improvement in performance over the Ampere architecture, the CEO said.\n\nThe company also announced a suite of new and updated AI software tools for speech recognition and translation, recommendation engines, and improved real-time communication including language translation, among other applications.\n\nNvidia unveiled a computer system for creating “digital twins” of physical worlds called Omniverse, with applications in robotics and industrial automation. The notion of digital twins is to provide digital representations of real-world objects to do testing and development.\n\nOmniverse also provides a new set of tools for the creation of virtual worlds and avatars. The company is launching a cloud service to allow designers to access Omniverse services remotely.\n\nHuang also announced updates to the company’s automated and electric-vehicle platforms, including new agreements with the EV manufacturers BYD (BYDDF)and [Lucid ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/lcid)(LCID) to use the Nvidia Drive platform on next-generation vehicles.\n\nNear midday in New York on Tuesday, Nvidia shares were up 0.7%, to $269.14. The stock has risen almost 27% over the last week, but is off about 8% for the year to date.",
