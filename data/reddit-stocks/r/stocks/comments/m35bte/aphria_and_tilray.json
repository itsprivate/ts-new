I have been invested in these companies in and out for quite some time. There is a scheduled merger between these two companies were all Aphria (APHA) shares will become TLRY shares with a conversion rate of every APHA share converting into roughly 0.83 TLRY shares come end of 2nd quarter (believe that would be April 14th). What I have noticed is that TLRY has been trading higher than it maybe should be given this conversion ratio. Basically, this means that if this conversion ratio were to be implemented today, it would be beneficial to buy APHA as these shares are currently worth less than 83% of the value of TLRY shares.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing this post, APHA is trading around $19.82 whereas TLRY is trading around $28.55. If the 0.83 conversion were to take place now, every APHA share would be converted into 0.83 TLRY shares which would be worth ~$23.70. It seems to me that in spite of this merger next month, either APHA is trading lower than it should or TLRY is trading higher. These stocks follow similar trends too and have essentially been consistently trading around the same percentage with APHA always trading lower than 83% of TLRY.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, shouldn’t the market adjust so that APHA gets closer to 83% of TLRY either by APHA going up independently of TLRY or TLRY going down independently of APHA. Otherwise am I missing something such as will the merger anyway reduce the stock price. Or perhaps since the merger is more than a month away this adjustment just hasn’t happened yet?</p>\n\n<p>I would think that since this company is expected to be the largest marijuana company in North America upon merging that APHA would seem to be the better buy than TLRY.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
