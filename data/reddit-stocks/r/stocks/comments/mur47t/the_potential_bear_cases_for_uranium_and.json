This makes sure that you are aware of the downside risk should one or two things go against you and derail the initial investment thesis. I have covered uranium on Reddit for almost a year now and addressed numerous of these bear cases, while simultaneously looking for one myself as well. Because I realize going back through all my posts and reading hundreds of comments is a course of action that few if any of you, understandably, have time for, I wanted to share with you a recent write up provided by John Quaks (quakes99 on Twitter). After talking to John, he was fine with it being shared on here as well in order to provide value to more people. He lays out the potential bear cases in a well written sense and it embodies everything (and more) of the things that I have discussed on here as well. Now, onto the write up:</p>\n\n<p>The bull case for Uranium seems as rock solid as they come for any commodity. Years of<br/>\n underinvestment and low uranium prices have led to long term mine suspensions that have pushed<br/>\n mined supply to a 12-year low while global nuclear capacity has risen every year for the past 8 years to push uranium demand back to pre-Fukushima levels once again. Analysts now predict that uranium will be in a sustained multi-year supply deficit made worse by depletion of existing mines and continuing delays in building the new mines needed to bring supply back into balance with demand.</p>\n\n<p>Idled mines need signed contracts closer to US$50/lb before they can commit to raising capital and<br/>\n hiring new mine workers needed to bring their long-dormant mines safely back into production. Mine restarts are costly and it can take a few years to cycle back up to nameplate capacity, and on their own are insufficient to bring mined supply back high enough to meet rising demand.<br/>\n Decisions to bring new mines into production are even more daunting with requirements for new capital investment of US$5 Billion plus to develop, permit, and build enough new mines and processing facilities to replace mined capacity set to close over the next decade and fill the estimated over 100 Million pounds per year mined supply deficit projected for 2035 based on a modest nuclear capacity growth rate of 1.5% per annum.</p>\n\n<p>In order for shareholders, Boards and lenders to give a new mine a construction &quot;green light there will need to be signed offtakes and long term contracts in the US$60+ range before committing to spending billions of dollars and hiring and training thousands of new mine workers. Even after construction go-aheads are given it will still take several years for new mines and mills to be built and eventually achieve their production targets.</p>\n\n<p>With uranium prices hovering around $30 per pound today, assuming a conservative nuclear growth<br/>\n model, at least a doubling of U308 prices will be needed to bring idled mines back into operating and<br/>\n incentivize enough new mines to begin construction and achieve their production capacity by the end of the decade. TradeTech has stated that they believe that 80 to 90 percent of all the uranium mine projects that exist today must be brought into production to meet future demand, many of which require uranium prices higher than $60/1b. Given the permitting political and funding challenges that all mine projects must face, only a small number of projects identified today will likely be successful in being constructed and achieving their projected production goals.</p>\n\n<p>Cameco CEO Tim Gitzel summed it up by saying that the world needs to discover, develop, and<br/>\n commission about 6 McArthur Rivers or Cigar Lakes in the next 15 years. That&#39;s new production of 108 Million pounds per year by 2035. The chances of that happening are slim to none even if uranium prices spike well beyond $60/1b to $100 or even $200 or more. No matter the price of uranium, there must be mine construction approvals, political support and certainty, billions of dollars in necessary investment many years to build mines and mills, hire and train mine workers as well as the inevitable unanticipated setbacks and delays which seem to plaque new mine construction Taken together, this is the rock solid bull case for uranium over the next decade or more. It doesn&#39;t even take into account the impact of an emerging global embracing of nuclear power to decarbonize economies to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions in the fight against Climate Change. A new global Nuclear Renaissance to satisfy the baseload carbon free energy required to electrify everything would make it all but impossible for mined uranium supply to ever catch up with rapidly growing demand added by the mass deployment of factory built advanced Generation I reactors small and micro modular reactors. A massive effort towards recycling of spent fuel to create a fully dosed fuel cycle would be needed to find the technological solutions to overcome the constraints on uranium supply.</p>\n\n<p>The bull case is clear to see, but what about the bear case? What if anything, might there be that<br/>\n could derail the inevitability of the uranium bull market? As uranium is a cyclical commodity that goes through boom and bust cycles based on changes to supply and/or demand, we can approach the question by looking at both side of the equation separately. On the nuclear demand side, the obvious potential show-stopper for the uranium bull market would be another major nuclear incident. However, whether such an event derails or instead temporarily delays the bull market boom cycle is another question. With 444 nuclear reactors in operation and another 54 already funded and under construction, a nuclear accident would have to be significant enough to lead<br/>\n to the shutting down of dozens of operating reactors and suspension or cancellation of many new<br/>\n reactor builds in order to put an end to a uranium bull market. Mined supply is in such a deep deficit<br/>\n that in the order of 70 currently operating reactors would need to be permanently shut down to match the estimated 35 Million pounds per year sustained supply deficit so as to prevent a further rise in uranium prices.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back at Fukushima, one has to keep in mind that it was the shutdown of Japan&#39;s 54 reactors, and decisions by Germany and some other nations to follow suit that derailed the nuclear renaissance that was underway back in 2011. It wasn&#39;t simply sentiment towards nuclear but a real change to uranium demand that sent U308 into an oversupply situation that drove down prices and led to shutting down mines and shelving mine development projects. A minor nuclear accident lacking in catastrophic outcomes would not likely be sufficient to change the trajectory of uranium prices today. Since Fukushima, billions of dollars have been invested by Japan and other western nations to undertake engineering studies, upgrade reactors and improve safety and security, so the likelihood of a major catastrophic nuclear incident is lower now than it was a decade ago.</p>\n\n<p>Other bearish events on the nuclear demand side would be a decision by China to abandon its<br/>\n accelerated nuclear build program and/or cancel its planned and approved reactor construction projects. Similarly, a decision by the US, Europe India and/or Russia to withdraw support for their nuclear industry, retire nuclear power plants early abandon plans to life-extend the current reactor fleet to 80+ years or any major global shift in sentiment away from nuclear could put downward pressure on demand. As it stands today, there are no signs of that happening as the world is now taking a second look at embracing nuclear as a key solution to fight climate change.</p>\n\n<p>What of nuclear Fusion to replace the world&#39;s Fission reactors? Anyone following the history of fission based nuclear power knows that it can take decades to prove up new technology develop the necessary regulatory framework establish safe and proven operating guidelines build and demonstrate a working commercial unit that harnesses the heat of the sun in a small reactor footprint that is not a risk to the environment and humanity. In my view we are decades away from achieving that goal and in the meantime all exsting nuclear reactors will continue to operate and more fission reactors will be built.</p>\n\n<p>As previously discussed the current bull market set up does not account for the introduction of<br/>\n advanced Gen I reactors such as small modular reactors so any movement away from SMRS or failure<br/>\n to deliver on expectations would do nothing at all to change the uranium supply dynamics as they are today. Similarly a deviation into alternative fuels for these new reactors in the 2030&#39;s does nothing to change the uranium supply vs demand dynamics of this decade.The uranium supply side, though more difficult to assess due to its inherent lack of visibility, does have a number of potentially bearish events to consider. The bear case that sits at the top of the list has been around for many years since before Kazakhstan moved to privatize its uranium mining industry, create a Swiss trading arm, and initiate a &quot;value over volume strategy of year-after-year flex-downs in supply. The argument is that Kazakhstan will simply ramp up its low-cost production to fill the supply gap and<br/>\n prevent any further upward movement in uranium prices. In the pre-privatization era that might be a potential show-stopper but is it really today? Kazakhstan&#39;s current resources and production capacity is assigned an upward limit of about 73 Million pounds per year by its government as reported to the IAEA and by Kazatomprom to its investors. That&#39;s just 15 Million pounds per year above its current 58 Million pounds &quot;flex down&quot; level that has been extended through the end of 2022. Even if Kazatomprom were to take the irrational business decision to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to &quot;flex up&quot; production to its 73 Million pounds maximum so as to push down uranium prices, punish its bottom line and eliminate its dividend, it would still not be sufficient to fill the multi-year sustained supply gap that will continue to worsen over the coming decade. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, other state-owned producers like Uzbekistan lack sufficient resources and production capacity to ramp up production to fill the supply gap. The Uzbeks announced last week that they are going to proceed with their plan to privatize their state-owned uranium mining company in the way Kazakhstan has done, so it appears the &quot;value over volume movement is gaining more momentum that further argues against this bear case.</p>\n\n<p>Barring some miraculous increase in mined uranium supply, the other sources of supply that could<br/>\n potentially rise would be in Secondary Supply or some unknown hoarded inventory that a uranium player decides to release into the market. Japan has long been argued as a potential source of a large volume of uranium to be sold into the market but the evidence of that has been little to none. Having invested in a large inventory at much higher prices, and with majority of that inventory already in the form of fabricated fuel assemblies custom made for each unique reactor, Japanese utilities would need to take considerable losses if they chose to liquidate, and would also need to pay to have fuel rods disassembled and even then the enriched uranium contained therein would not likely be directly useful to a buyer in its current state. With Japan moving to restart more reactors and achieve a higher nuclear contribution level to achieve its own Net Zero carbon emissions goals, it seems more likely they will continue to hold on to all available &quot;fully paid for&quot; inventory to fuel their restarted reactors over the coming decade and even buy more uranium as more units are restarted.</p>\n\n<p>On Secondary Supply, the main source has been underfeeding in the uranium enrichment process and re-enrichment of depleted tails. I&#39;m no expert in this area but my research shows that when there is a lack of demand for enrichment services, the enrichers will use that excess capacity in their centrifuges to &quot;underleed&quot; at the front end of an enrichment order and then sell the unused feed into the Spot market or offer it to other customers as a feed source at market prices. The key factor is that it is not technically possible to simply shut down centrifuges to save money. They must be kept spinning. Enrichers can recover their power costs by underfeeding to produce saleable matenal or reprocess depleted tails as a way to generate offsetting cash flow. If nuclear utilities continue to delay their contracting for enrichment services then underfeeding and tails re-enrichment will continue to produce secondary supply to dampen a uranium price rise. However arising SWU enrichment price and an expected rise in contracting after years of delays is expected by majority of analysts and nuclear fuel consultants to lead to a reduction in Secondary Supply over the coming years.  </p>\n\n<p>A possible bear case event that could side-swipe the recovery in uranium prices would be the<br/>\n announcement of another Megatons to Megawatts program by the US and/or Russia. This would involve the downblending of weapons grade (95%+ enriched uranium) down to the 5-7% level in order to make nuclear reactor fuel. This was done for 20 years from 1993-2013 and acted as a virtual uranium mine producing around 25 Million pounds per year, fueling half the US nuclear reactor fleet for 2 decades. If some new denuclearization effort were to emerge then this could happen again, but as things stand today it seems highly unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>Another possible bearish event would be the emergence of new inexpensive technology that could be used to convert nuclear waste and stockpiles of depleted uranium into nuclear reactor fuel. Companies are working on Laser Enrichment as such a technology that could revolutionize the enrichment industry and, if successful, help to produce more Secondary Supply to meet reactor fuel needs. As it stands, the processes involved are very expensive, and still many years away, which makes mining raw uranium, converting and enriching into reactor fuel using the establish nuclear fuel cycle of today, the cheapest way to go at the present time. When uranium prices spike far higher, expensive sources of secondary supply become more economically viable, but that makes this bear case dependent on there being a strong uranium bull market in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>What of Thorium as a replacement fuel? Thorium has been promoted as a better fuel source than<br/>\n uranium but to this day it has not taken off into commercial use so the jury remains out on thorium<br/>\n reactors as being economically or practically viable. The global nuclear industry has invested trillions of dollars into reactors, ennchment conversion and nuclear fuel fabrication facilities all based on uranium as the fuel source. There is incredibly strong inertia for that to continue into the future. Thorium has its own issues as well which have yet to be overcome. Converting the 500 operating &amp; under construction reactors to operate on a different fuel is just not happening. There is no substitute for uranium today. Some point to recent news that uranium can be extracted from seawater as a bearish new technology to derail a bull market but the data on its development says otherwise. So far only very small quantities (grams) of uranium have been successfully extracted from large quantities of seawater. Producing tens of millions of pounds of fuel-grade uranium still appears to be decades away if a successful process can be developed on a large scale. The economics and environmental impact of such an industry are still big unknowns yet to be determined, so there is little likelihood of this emerging technology in its infancy today becoming a supply disruptor this decade though future prospects are encouraging.</p>\n\n<p>There are always going to be possible geopolitical events that can change the flow of uranium supply<br/>\n and have a significant impact on nuclear fuel demand. Those were an issue decades ago heading into<br/>\n the last uranium bull market and are just as probable today. However I think it is safe to say that<br/>\n geopolitics sides with the uranium bull thesis as it more than likely involves disruption to supply than the opening up of some new source of uranium to meet global demand. The standard uranium<br/>\n supply/demand models built by analysts assume smooth sailing for mine development activities, no<br/>\n uranium trade issues and steady as she goes in terms of geopolitics History shows us that things rarely go as planned which I believe further strengthens the bull case investing thesis for uranium to be rock solid commodity for investors this decade. Those are a few of the bull and bear case arguments re explored.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: You made it to the end and I hope it was informative. The conclusion of this write up is quite simple really. While yes, there are several bear cases that could be considered when investing in uranium, all of them have solid counterarguments that have to be considered as a counterweight to those. There are few, if any, solid bear cases which will derail this investment thesis outside of the risk that we see a significant meltdown of another nuclear power plant. This thesis is getting stronger by the day and while equities have already ran up a lot and are due for a big more of a correction in the short term, the 3 to 4 year trend is clearly upwards and I will stick by the take I shared in October of last year, that uranium will be the best performing broad investment asset class from that point until roughly 2024/2025. Please remember to always do your own due diligence as none of this is investment advice and conviction cannot be copied. Hope you all have a great rest of your day and best of luck out there.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
