  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 6, 2021**\n\nStocks were mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) underperforming, while previous laggards like financial, industrial, and energy stocks picked up the slack, driving both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) to fresh, intraday, all-time highs. While the past few weeks have been quite choppy, with concerns surrounding inflation and the coronavirus Delta variant weighing on the minds of investors, the overall market has displayed remarkable strength amid record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion. Today, market participants were encouraged by the July Job Report, which showed a stronger-than-expected rebound in employment last month.\n\nThe Labor Department’s July Jobs Report marked an unexpected upswing in employment, with the economy adding 943,000 jobs to the 845,000 expected. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, also better than the 5.7% expected. With the coronavirus Delta variant forcing some parts of the US to reinstate some pandemic-era measures, like indoor mask mandates, market participants were closely waiting for this unemployment report. Like I said yesterday, this Job Report was a bit of a wild card, with estimates fluctuating widely from 330,000 to the high 900,000s. Earlier in the week a report by ADP suggested private payrolls were much weaker than expected, with only 330,000 private payrolls added versus the 700,000 expected. On the other hand, Bloomberg economists estimated a gain of more than 900,000 jobs. Happy to see the report come in so positive, a great sign, that despite headwinds remaining, the labor market continues to recover. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85% year-on-year, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Weekly Unemployment Report came in roughly in-line with analyst expectations\n   * First time jobless claims: 385,000 vs 383,000 expected\n   * Continuing Claims 2.93 million vs 3 million\n* Walmart (WMT) is offering special bonuses to many warehouse employees to work every hour they are scheduled and, in some cases giving temporary pay raises, as the country's biggest retailer ramps up for the holiday shopping season\n* Target (TGT) said it plans to invest $200 million in education programs that would cover the cost of tuition, fees and textbooks for part- and full-time workers who pursue a qualifying undergraduate degree at more than 40 institutions. It will also fund advanced degrees, paying up to $10,000 each year for master’s programs at those schools. Just the latest examples of companies actively changing to become more attractive for employees. Chipotle (CMG) and Starbucks (SBUX) have similar program to this in place. \n* The crackdown in China continues… Alibaba (BABA) told investors during a call that their tax rate will balloon to 20% by the end of Q3, according to a report by Bloomberg. This is likely due to the fact that the CCP has removed a 10% preferential tax break given to “key software enterprises”. This is likely to affect other Chinese technology and internet stocks. \n* In other news, food-delivery giant Meituan received a $1 billion fine from the CCP for forcing merchants to work exclusively on its platform. The market cap of this company has reportedly halved since February peak of $168 billion. \n* President Biden on Thursday signed an executive order setting a target for electric vehicles, hydrogen-fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles to make up 50% of U.S. sales by 2030 -- a voluntary goal that auto makers said necessitated federal support for vehicle charging stations and consumer tax incentives.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect the closing price\\*\\***\n* Abiomed (ABMD) target raised by Deutshce Bank from $360 to $410 at Buy. Stock currently around $346\n* Allstate (ALL) target raised by Barclays from $144 to $147 at Overweight. Stock currently around $131\n* Avalara (AVLR) with a host of target raises.
