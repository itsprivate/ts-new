When it comes to my long-term portfolio I am a value investor and I believe another great buying opportunity is upon us. I can tell you 80% of the gains I've made in the last 5 years were from buying during the two aforementioned market corrections.  I encourage all the newer investors that have entered the market these last two years to look at this market correction as a great buying opportunity as well. [Finviz.com](https://Finviz.com) and [sec.gov/edgar](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) should be your best friends when evaluating the fundamentals and financials of a company. Take the time to read some 10-Qs and learn about how P/E, P/S, FCF, debt/equity, ROA and the other financial metrics are used in evaluating the value of a company. Personally I still think the market has another 10% left to fall, but timing the bottom is something I'll leave to those much smarter than me, and I will focus on what I deem to be good value plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy list:\n\n1.
