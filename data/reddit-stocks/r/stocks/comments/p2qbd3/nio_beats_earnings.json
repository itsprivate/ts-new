Vehicle margins, however, slipped sequentially. The company also said it's on track to launch three new vehicles in 2022.\n\n**Key Nio Q2 Metrics:** Nio reported a second-quarter loss of $52 million, or a loss of 3 cents per share, on a non-GAAP basis. This compares to the year-ago loss of 18 cents per share and the consensus loss estimate of 11 cents per share.\n\nRevenues came in at $1.3084 billion, up 127.2% from the year-ago's $550.47 million and exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.298 billion. The company had previously guided to second-quarter revenues of $1.243 billion to $1.298 billion.\n\nVehicle sales accounted for $1.2254 billion or 93.7% of the total revenues.\n\nIn the first quarter, the manufacturer of premium EVs reported a narrower loss of 4 cents per share on revenues of $1.22 billion. Second-quarter vehicle margin was at 20.3% compared to 21.2% in the first quarter. A year-ago, vehicle margin was at 9.7%.\n\nNio ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $7.5 billion compared to the $7.3 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n\n [NIO Inc.
