It's insane.  None of my trades are options.  These are common shares.  I've lost a fortune on mega cap stocks, micro cap, energy plays, financial, tech, discretionary, Buffet plays, value, meme stocks, short squeeze plays, momentum, earnings, technical plays, shorting SPY and QQQ, contrarian, etc.  Even followed a lot of trade ideas traders and they've all been losers.  I'm not kidding.  I've lost over $1000 every single day this entire month.... consecutively.. no green days.  My entire portfolio right now is down ON AVERAGE 30%.  Some positions down 75%.  My best position is AMZN and that's down 25%.  Again, these are not options.  These are shares.  It's ridiculous.  I am the anti-market.  10 years of savings gone in a month.  I'm on the verge of suicide again, but if anyone wants to get rich I am the ultimate indicator.    Seriously, I will post my trades.  At least someone else can get rich.  I believe I'm cursed but it would make me happy to make others bank.  There's no indicator in the world that can beat my 90% track record.",
