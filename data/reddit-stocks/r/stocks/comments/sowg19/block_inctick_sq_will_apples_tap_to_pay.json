Additional payment platforms and apps will follow later this year. \n\nCashapp and the Square terminal are Block's lifeline and a major driver in their business; although this only targets the B2C side, it is still a direct challenge to Block's dominance in this area, as Block offers financial services and POS terminals to businesses which tie into their Cashapp and recent BNPL ecosystem.\n\nDo you guys think Apple will be able to pose a direct threat to Block's business?",
