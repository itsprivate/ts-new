Although the music industry might not be the most profitable one and profits are still to be made, I believe there is more money to be made in other sectors. \n\nNonetheless I simply adore their product. For 5€ as a student I get access to basically all of the worlds music. The app is great and while expanding into podcasts they don't fail to innovate.
