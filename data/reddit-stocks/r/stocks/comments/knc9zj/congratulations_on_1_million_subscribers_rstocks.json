Yes, today this Reddit community has officially crossed that unthinkable subscriber count. Oh my!</p>\n\n<p>OK OK, first things first -- I need to give some cred where credit is most certainly overdue here.</p>\n\n<p>Most notably to, <a href=\"/u/provoko\">/u/provoko</a> and to <a href=\"/u/GoldenChrysus\">/u/GoldenChrysus</a> for running this amazingly awesome stock community! And to the rest of the staff team here as well of course! :)</p>\n\n<p>It has been a pretty interesting past couple of years, especially this year. :P</p>\n\n<p>Well, I won&#39;t make this too lengthy of a congrats post like I normally do at some other subreddit communities, but I really just did want to extend a humongous THANK YOU to the entire <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> community here. I have been a regular on here (mostly nowadays just posting up those weekend market week ahead threads) and I can tell y&#39;all&#39;s first hand that this is one helluva stock Reddit community IMHO.</p>\n\n<p>The members here are incredibly welcoming, and knowledgeable. And best of all, extremely helpful to all the new arrivals!</p>\n\n<p>Truth be told here, but outside of my own subreddit community, this is indeed my most favorite of all on Reddit!</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just a real chill place to hang out, chatting with members who enjoy similar interests, like trading and investing. :)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m personally really grateful for this community honestly, cannot stress that enough.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also pretty cool that this milestone is happening so close to the New Year!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, keep up the great work around here <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> community, and to the entire staff team here.</p>\n\n<p>You guys are a bunch of cool chaps here. ;)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for having me too, have really enjoyed my years here!</p>\n\n<p>Catch y&#39;all&#39;s in the new year!</p>\n\n<p>Happy 1 million subscribers <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a>!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
