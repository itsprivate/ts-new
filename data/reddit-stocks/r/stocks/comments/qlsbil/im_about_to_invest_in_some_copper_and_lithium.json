It’s not really a lot, but I’m thinking of investing in some copper and lithium too.\n\nWith copper stocks, I’m planning to go for [Southern Copper Corporation](http://www.southerncoppercorp.com/) (SCCO) since they pay a dividend of $2.70 per share. I feel like they are a safe choice to invest in. Also contemplating investing in BHP, There’s a lot going on with copper right now, and I know I might be too late on this, but I still want to take a chance on it.\n\n[Lundin Gold](https://www.lundingold.com/) (LUG) is pretty good too. There was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, but they recently announced the production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year. Their production went up by 14% in Ecuador for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nI’m looking into [Three Valley Copper](https://www.threevalleycopper.com/) (TVC)[ ](https://miningfeeds.com/stock/three-valley-copper-corp.-tsxv/)when it comes to explorations. They’re on a roll recently, and they just announced that they entered into an agreement for a C$10 million bought deal financing. They will start mining next month or in early 2022 and are expected to have an annual production between 13,000 and 16,000 tonnes of copper cathode by 2023.\n\nI haven’t thought of any lithium stocks to invest in, so I’m hoping you guys can suggest some. What do you think of my options?",
