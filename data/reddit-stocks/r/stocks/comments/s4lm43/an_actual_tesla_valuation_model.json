I literally can't indent twice in reddit, and I literally can't keep it from auto numbering random lines\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\1) I'll start with the risks to my valuation model: \n\nTesla not achieving 50% annual growth target for sales.\n\nAn actual economic recession where consumers have to drastically cut back spending\n\nA 20%+ drop in the stock market where companies valuations are suppressed despite growing earnings\n\nQuick Notes: This is based *only* on EV sales. This does not include solar and energy storage, AI, robotics, or FSD. I see 2027 as the peak year of profitability for Tesla EV sales (we'll see why in my model in section 2ai).\n\n\n2) Here's my equation for year 2027:\n\n#$12,000 gaap earnings per EV * 12,100,000 EVs delivered * 50 P/E = $7260/share\n\nSections 2a, 2b and 2c will be the reasoning behind $12k gaap earnings per ev, 12.1M EVs delivered, and 50 P/E respectively\n\n2a) This will be the most difficult to explain. I'll start with my model and an explanation\n\n2ai) Here's my model: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_Qp2gXP1HV3EC5UOWBytx6Kn5dfNftqkTo0EwP0Ua8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDisclaimer on model: I wouldn't take 2028+ in this model too seriously. At some point, sales will flatten. i.e. sales will S-curve. When that flatten and taper will happen is up for debate. IMO, it will be around 2030. Also, P/E will likely diminish to below 50 by 2030 when the S-curve flattens. I still see 2027 as the golden year.\n\nExplanation of model: Warning, this is incredibly detailed. \n\nThe black numbers are known numbers (from 2021 Q3 back to 2020 Q3). The red numbers are unknown, but projected numbers. From known numbers in the ER reports I was able to calculate ASP (average selling price, i.e. total auto revenue/evs delivered), COG per EV (cost of goods per EV, i.e. ASP*(1- gross margin)), earnings per EV ((non-GAAP EPS*outstanding shares)/EV delivered), and I was also able to calculate a sort of \"operational/manufacturing cost per EV\" by this equation:\n\nASP - COG per EV - earnings per EV = \"operational\" cost per EV\n\nHere's a beautiful illustration of this equation:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u\n\nSo now that we have ASP, COG per EV, earnings per EV, an \"operational\" cost per EV and EVs delievered.. how do I project to get the red numbers? I extrapolated using exponential decay. Based on the rates that ASP, COG per EV and \"operational\" cost per EV were already falling.. I took that rate extrapolated out using an exponential decay model. I also assumed 50% YoY growth in EVs delievred (or 10.66% QoQ). \n\nThe math for exponential decay was pretty annoying. Here's the recursive equation: P1 = (P0 - b)*(1 - r) + b where P1 is one iteration past P0, b is the asymptote and r is the rate of decay. Solving for r gives r = 1-(P1-b)/(P0-b), and so I calculated the average r from the past 4 or 5 iterations to \"use\" the existing rate of decay. Interesting fact, I had to assume some 'asymptotes' for ASP, COG per EV and operational cost per EV, but if you look at my bear, base and bull cases, you actually won't see much difference.. so long as the asymptotes are approximately accurate to reality.\n\nSo now that I've extrapolated ASP, COG per EV, \"operational\" cost per EV and EVs delivered.. I can now calculate the project non-GAAP earnings per EV via the equation I used above: \n\nearnings per EV = ASP - COG per EV - \"operational\" cost per EV\nthis one: https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u\n\nAfter finding earnings per EV, divide by the projected EVs delivered, and then by outstanding shares and you have the non-GAAP EPS estimates.\n\nNow for some interesting (but not very pretty) graphs. Again, take 2029 and 2030 with a grain of salt. The S-curve will flatten\nASP graph:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6WxztBq\n\nCOG per EV graph:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/BTIvmU2\n\nOperational cost per EV graph:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vpZSGcl\n\nThis is my favorite graph. Through no design of my own, but only from exponential decay extrapolations of other metrics, the non-GAAP earnings per EV graph forms an upside down U, with 2027 as the year we'll see peak profitability per EV.\nnon-GAAP earnings per EV graph:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/sOipox5\n\nnon-GAAP EPS graph:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bIoeGPy\n\n\nok, so why do we see dropping ASP, COG and operational costs?\n\n2aii) Dropping battery costs is basically Wright's Law (Cathie was right about this). Battery costs were as high as $1000/kWh when Tesla first started building the original Roadster. It has since dropped to $100/kWh, and is expected to drop to $50 or less per kWh. Here's a great video of a presentation made by Tony Seba, and a section where he discusses dropping costs for innovative technology: (can't post youtube links in r/stocks. Search for \"The Great Disruption - Rethinking Energy, Transportation, Food &amp; Agriculture / August 17th, 2021\" and battery costs are mentioned at the 6:45 mark). This is why we'll see COG per EV dropping exponentially.\n\n\n2aiii) \"Tesla isn't profitable!\" we heard for years. This is because they were burning cash for R&amp;D. They've made their manufacturing incredibly efficient, and with 2 new factories we'll see even more benefits from Economies of Scale: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp . Also, as Tesla opens Austin to serve the east coast US, and Berlin to serve Europe we'll see decreased shipping costs. This will cause the \"operational/manufacturing\" cost per EV to drop.\n\n\n2aiv) regulatory credits were only 13% of earnings in 2021 Q3. I suspect they'll vanish by the end of 2022, and Tesla will still be insanely profitable.\n\n\n2b) Will Tesla deliver 12M EVs in 2027? This is a fundamental risk for my model, as stated above. If Tesla maintains their 50% YoY sales growth, then well... the math says 12M in 2027. We'll see. However, one thing for certain will not change Tesla sales:\n\n\n2bi) Competition. Tesla has *always* had competition. They had competition in 2013 to their Model S, and the have competition today. It's the ICE car, and Tesla is winning. A couple points to make here:\n\nI wont get into this point too much. It took Tesla 5 years from their first mass produced EV until they managed positive Free Cash Flow (2013 Model S until 2018). It's not exactly a one-to-one comparison for other companies, but Ford, GM, Rivian, Lucid and others will need at least a couple years to achieve positive free cash flow. But let's say all of them succeed in making a nice commercially viable, and profitable EV..\n\nMy next point is that the EV market is expanding.. *rapidly*. New EV models will not take sales from Tesla. They will take sales from the Toyota Corolla, RAV4, Camry, Honda Civic, Accord, Hyundai cars, Volkwagen cars, etc. BTW: we've already begun to see this :) *whispers* Tesla IS the chip shortage\n\n\n2c) The P/E ratio will always be a guess. Tesla will be a company with a presence in EV sales, solar and energy storage, large commercial power storage, and potentially FSD software subscriptions and AI driven bots. Maybe the only way to have their Level 4 FSD is by paying $300/month. I believe (assuming a bull market) that there will still be enough frenzy surrounding Tesla to see a 100 P/E in 2027. The conservative side of me calculates these numbers with 50. By the time the S-Curve flattens, the P/E could be 30.. or maybe 60 like Amazon? It's hard to say where Tesla will be in 2030, but I have a feeling they will be selling things we're not talking about today. \n\nI do know one thing though; Tesla should *never* be trading at Toyota, Ford, or GM's P/E ratios. The ICE car is a dead technology, not dropping in price like the EV, and is proving to be far inferior to EVs in every way. It just took Elon investing billions in a company that burned cash for a decade to bring down those battery costs. The world will see soon enough.\n\n\nAnyway, I hope you guys liked this DD. I'll try to have discussion with you guys in the comments if you'd like. If you have a bearish counterpoint, then I'm all about discussing it; however, point out which part of this equation it affects:\n\n$12,000 gaap earnings per EV * 12,100,000 EVs delivered * 50 P/E = $7260/share\n\nOtherwise, I won't respond. I put numbers out there. If you think they're wrong, then tell me which you think is wrong before we discuss.\n\nr/stocks rules says I have to disclose my position.. I'm long as hell on TSLA, and short on F and GM.",
