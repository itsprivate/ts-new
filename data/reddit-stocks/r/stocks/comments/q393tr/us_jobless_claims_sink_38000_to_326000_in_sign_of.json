  "selftext": "The numbers: Some 326,000 people who recently lost their jobs applied for unemployment benefits in early October, marking the first decline in a month and pointing to further improvement in the U.S. labor market. New jobless claims paid traditionally by the states fell by 38,000 in the seven days ended Oct. 2 from 364,000 in the prior week, the government said Thursday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had estimated new claims would drop to a seasonally adjusted 345,000. \n\nBefore the most recent decline, new applications for jobless benefits had risen three weeks in a row, raising questions about whether the delta variant had forced more businesses to lay off workers. Yet most of the increase took place in California and suggested the problems were not widespread. The rest of the states have largely seen applications for unemployment benefits flatten out or decline over the past month.\n\nThe number of people already collecting state jobless benefits, meanwhile, dropped by 98,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.71 million. These so-called continuing claims are near a pandemic low. Altogether, some 4.17 million people were reportedly receiving jobless benefits through eight separate state or federal programs as of Sept. 18. That’s down sharply from 11.3 million at the start of the month, mostly because of the end of temporary federal program to help the unemployed.\n\nThe critical U.S. employment report for September that comes out on Friday could shed light on whether more people are returning to the labor force. Wall Street economists predict job creation will more than doubled to around 500,000 from just 235,000 new jobs created in August.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-jobless-claims-sink-38-000-to-326-000-in-sign-of-improving-labor-market-11633610565?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-jobless-claims-sink-38-000-to-326-000-in-sign-of-improving-labor-market-11633610565?mod=mw_latestnews)",
