They also called the stock market’s rally off the mid-June lows unsustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEquities were slightly higher at midday Monday, taking back modest loses seen after U.S. data missed forecasts and China’s unexpected signs of slowing growth damped investor sentiment. Financial markets have been shifting back and forth between two narratives — one in which easing inflation and slowing growth give the Fed room to back off aggressive rate hikes, the other in which persistently high price gains coupled with a robust labor market compel policy makers to continue lifting borrowing costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuly’s downside surprise in the consumer-price index gave equities a boost and helped send the S&amp;P 500 SPX, 0.40% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, 0.62% to their fourth straight week of gains on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 has surged more than 16% from its June low and retraced more than 50% of its bear-market drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRead: Inflation surge cools in July. Should you still play defense with your portfolio?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We don’t think the equity bounce is worth chasing,” said strategists Wei Li, Beata Harasim and Tara Sharma, along with BlackRock Investment Institute’s Deputy Head Alex Brazier. “We believe the Fed will remain susceptible to ‘the politics of inflation,’ a chorus of voices demanding it tame inflation. Our bottom line: The latest inflation reading isn’t enough to spur the Fed pivot we’ve been waiting for to lean back into stocks.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat’s more, they said, consumer spending is in the process of shifting toward services and away from goods, the category which benefited from the stay-at-home stage of the pandemic. That shift “could hit stocks,” according to the BlackRock strategists: They note that earnings tied to goods are expected to make up 62% of the S&amp;P 500’s profits this year, versus 38% for services, as shown in the chart below. A boom in services would power the economy more than it would S&amp;P 500 earnings.",
