It actually worked out well for me several times now. But it’s a really difficult strategy to execute.\n\nMy theory was that you can identify a good entry point in a stock based on a negative change in online sentiment which is NOT correlated to company news and updates or market performance etc.\n\nI believed that if the online sentiment changed to a negative one overall without there being an underlying reason, that it was a good sign that people shorting the stock were anxious to keep the price down and others were bashing it online to get a better entry point.\n\nMy theory is that the bashing behaviour doesn’t occur at random. It occurs strategically.\n\nIf people know the share price is going to go up in the mid term and want to keep it quiet to get a better entry point there are going to be some people who attack the stock online to try to bring the price down to give themselves more time for a lower buy in point.\n\nIf people have been shorting a stock and need time to exit their positions as they are anticipating a rise in share price they will be inclined to do the same as well.\n\nSo, in a way, online stock bashing could be seen as an inverse indicator of the current overall expectations of the actual future share price.\n\nHere’s how the strategy works. Use websites that provide indicators of stock sentiment on social media. Pick out companies which have recently had strong negative sentiment. Figure out if there is a valid reason for the change in sentiment based on publicly available information about the company.\n\nIf nothing has changed in the companys underlying performance and they were in an uptrend before the negative sentiment began, begin to investigate the nature of the online sentiment.\n\nGo on Reddit, Stocktwits or Twitter and actually read through all the comments you can find. Check to see whether or not the negative comments are baseless.\n\nIf the sentiment of the stock online is negative for a good reason, such as anticipating a logical negative outcome, then stay away.\n\nIf the comments bashing the stock are baseless and can’t be backed up by logic, fact or reasonable predictions then you probably have a winner.\n\nUnfortunately this strategy can be stressful. You have to read a lot of negativity. You have to think critically and have extensive knowledge of how the market and businesses work. You have to be able to discern bullshit and emotional statements from logic. You have to be able to tell the difference between genuine criticism of a company’s performance and false criticism which can sound logical but often skews the facts to try to generate a negative view of the company. But those types of statements won’t stand up to solid research on the company.\n\nIf a stock is being heavily attacked online using flawed logic and emotional statements and there are no red flags about the company other than a recent change in share price caused by the above bashing and trolling behaviours then you probably have a good buy in point as the stock will now have an unfair lower price point caused exclusively by bashers.\n\nIf you strongly believe this is the case and there is no discernible grey area after solid investigation, just buy the stock. Ignore websites that give price targets as those are always generated based on existing numbers including the dips caused by bashing.\n\nYou have to be willing to hold until the bashing behaviour subsides or until the company’s performance proves them wrong. Once it does and investor sentiment returns to the norm you will gain by the artificial price suppression being lifted. In addition, companies being bashed like this usually have something going for them so you can capitalize on their progress at the same time.\n\nI guess you could say this strategy basically takes advantage of trolls and bashers and uses the price suppression resulting from their online behaviour as leverage to amplify your gains.",
