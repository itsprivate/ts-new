DraftKings to Maintain Lead of $30 Billion Market**\n\nDraftKings can trim promotions faster and implement national ads sooner than rivals active in fewer markets. Although 3Q book-launch promotions crimped Ebitda, the company has 2022 upside potential from acquiring Golden Nugget Online and bet legalization in new states. DraftKings' advantage should prevail, even if its leading share of betting ebbs as rivals gain scale. The company projects North American legalized online-gaming will reach $30 billion in gross revenue by 2023, and it expects to glean $5-$7 billion annually, based on the percentage of population with bets. Its app is live in 15 OSB states and five of seven i-casino states. DraftKings tops FanDuel, BetMGM and Caesars in wagers. DraftKings' early market presence, with 5 million fantasy-sports users, can enable it to cut promotions as online markets mature",
