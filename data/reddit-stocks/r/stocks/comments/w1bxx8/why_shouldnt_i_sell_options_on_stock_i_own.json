Im still a little confused on the terminology). So if the stock goes down then I just make money on the premium I've made, and if the stock goes up then I won't actually lose money, I'll still make the premium, i just won't get as much benefit. So is this a valid way to make money or is there some reason this doesn't work? Thanks.",
