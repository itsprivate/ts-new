I try to aim for companies that dominate a sub-sector of their related market, and Nintendo appears to have very much done that with the handheld gaming market. \n\n\nHowever, upon checking their ticker this morning, I noticed a strange pattern over the past 10 days (10 min candles), shown at the bottom of [this pic](https://imgur.com/a/HchhQHn). (This pic isn't going to be too friendly to those of you on mobile, so I apologize.) \n\n***\nFirstly, the ADX seems to be making wild swings every day, with OTO Buying dominating one day, and the OTO Selling dominating the next day (shown at the bottom.) This seems to have no effect on the price however, which seems to tank OTO everyday, after opening |1-2|% away from prior close. This pattern starts around 9/1-9/3.\n\n***\nSecondly, the price has regular major disparities between Close and Open, without any significant extended hours trading. I've seen major hops like this happening on meme stocks, but that's usually when paired with a lot more extended hours trading.\n\n***\nLastly, there appears to be some major institutional sell-off on 9/9 and 9/15. When I check the institutional holding via Fidelity, I see -0.1%. How is this possible? Would short positions result in \"negative holdings\"? Why are institutions so bearish on Nintendo? I mean, their stock has had its hard times in the past, but - IMO - they've demonstrated how their \"missteps\" can lead to great things (without the Wii and Wii U, there wouldn't be a Switch.)\n\n***\nI read that Nintendo recently did a share buyback. Would that cause this type of price action? If not, what would? Do institutional traders just hate video games? What's going on with NTDOY?",
