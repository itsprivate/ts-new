  "selftext": "There is a mathematical boundary that distinguishes a Wall Street Bet from an ordinary trade. This boundary may be described as the point at which the expected geometric growth rate of a trade becomes negative. The minimum fraction of ones available capital, *w*, needed to qualify a trade as a Wall Street Bet is found by solving the following equation for *w:*\n\n(1+wb)**^(p)**(1-w)^(1-p)*=1*\n\nEvery trade can be described by the following variables:\n\n*r:* an expected geometric growth rate, expressed as a fraction of capital. For example, if one’s expected geometric growth rate is positive 12%, then r=1.12. If the trade has a negative expected geometric growth rate of -15%, then r=0.85.\n\n*f:* the fraction of capital invested. If one commits 20% of their capital to a trade, then f = 0.2. If one is all in, f=1.\n\n*b:* the return earned on a winning trade, as a fraction of capital committed to the trade. For example, if the odds are 2:1, and your account is up $2,000 from $1,000 risked, then b = 2.\n\n*a:* the loss from a losing trade, as a fraction of capital committed to the trade. For example, if one loses 50% of the money they spent on a trade, a = 0.5.\n\n*p:* the probability of a winning trade. For example, if the probability of a winning trade is 69%, then *p* = 0.69.\n\nThe expected geometric growth rate is found by the formula: r =(1+fb)**^(p)**(1-fa)*^(1-p)*\n\nThe Wall Street gambler does not take partial losses however as they prefer to hold losing options until expiry. The loss from a losing trade, *a,* thus equals 1 as the Wall Street Bet’s losses are equal to the total portion *f* spent on the trade. The equation can thus be simplified:\n\nr =(1+fb)**^(p)**(1-f)*^(1-p)*\n\nThe optimal amount *f* to commit to a trade is given by the Kelly Criterion. When *a* = 1, the Kelly Criterion is *f = p+(p-1)/b.* Plotting *f* on the x axis and *r* on the y axis, the Kelly Criterion gives us the maximum possible value of expected growth rate for a given probability *p* and odds *b*. Where the curve crosses the x axis, however, the expected growth rate of the trade equals zero. For values of *f* higher than this intercept, the trade is expected to lose money. It is thus a Wall Street Bet, and not a respectable trade. ([https://i.imgur.com/39c5qH0.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/39c5qH0.jpeg))\n\nThe trade that commits more to a single trade than Kelly and gives a growth rate of *r < 1* is a Wall Street Bet, and the fraction of capital *w* above which the growth rate is negative is the Wall Street Bet Criterion. For example, for a trade with a win probability of *p = 0.333...,* and payout odds of 5:1  *b = 5,* the Kelly Criterion gives a fraction *f* of 0.2, meaning a trader should commit 20% of their capital on the trade for a growth rate of *r=1.09*, which would turn $1000 into over $5 million over 100 trades on average. The Wall Street Gambler, however, would commit more than 44.2% of their available capital to the trade, ensuring that they would eventually turn their $1000 into $0. Here is a chart of some values for reference: ([https://i.imgur.com/7rBGG9r.png](https://i.imgur.com/7rBGG9r.png))\n\nThe formula for the Wall Street Bet Criterion is *(1+*wb)**^(p)**(1-w)^(1-p)*=1.* Solving for *w* is not as easy as it appears. Wolfram Alpha couldn’t do it, and neither could I. For example, for *p=0.25, w* can only be simplified to algebraic gobbledy gook like *w ≈ -(2\\^(1/3) (-3 b - 1))/(3 b (-27 b\\^2 + 27 sqrt(b\\^2 + 0.518519 b + 0.111111) b - 9 b - 2)\\^(1/3)) + (-27 b\\^2 + 27 sqrt(b\\^2 + 0.518519 b + 0.111111) b - 9 b - 2)\\^(1/3)/(3 2\\^(1/3) b) - (1 - 3 b)/(3 b).* Take a look at the solution for p = 0.6: ([https://i.imgur.com/XjemjW3.png](https://i.imgur.com/XjemjW3.png))\n\nI hope that someone can show me a solution to the Wall Street Bets Criterion equation. In the meantime, I have found that for *p=0.5, w*  = 2 times the amount given by Kelly. The relationship between *p* and *w* appears to be polynomial and the relationship between *b* and *w* appears logarithmic.\n\nLess than optimal trades that still produce positive expected returns are not Wall Street Bets, they are just bad trades. If one is having difficulty turning their trade into a Wall Street Bet, there are three strategies one may pursue:\n\nIncrease the amount committed to a trade to above the value for *w.* This is the easiest and most straightforward way to turn a trade into a Wall Street Bet. Committing 100% of one's capital to any trade where  *p < 1* will safely ensure that the trade is, in fact, a Wall Street Bet. Alternatively, the aspiring Wall Street Gambler can seek to find a trade with a lower probability. Lowering the probability of a win *p* can cause one’s fraction of capital committed *f* to exceed *w.* Finally, one can attempt to lower the expected payoff *b* for a winning trade.\n\nA word of caution: for high probabilities, it may take more extreme measures than you might intuitively suspect to categorically declare your trade a Wall Street Bet. For example, for *p = 0.9* and the odds are a modest 1:1, *b= 1,* the amount of one’s capital that must be committed to the Wall Street Bet is over 99.8%! Any amount less than that is actually profitable in the long run and thus not a Wall Street Bet - it is merely a suboptimal trade.\n\nFinding the value *w* is cumbersome without a solution to the equation (1+wb)**^(p)**(1-w)^(1-p)*=1 and* I hope that someone shares a simplified solution for *w.* Solving the equation would make it far more convenient for Wall Street Gambler to ensure that one's trades have a negative expected growth rate.",
