  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 30, 2021**\n\nUnfortunately, after a brief bounce in the market yesterday, volatility resumed as market participants continue to contemplate the potential impact of the new coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant and new comments by newly re-elected Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Since the new variant was discovered last week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) erased all its November gains and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed its worst month since April 2020, down more than 4%. \n\n**Some Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.87%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%\n* Dow Jones (DIA) -1.77%\n* SPY Bank ETF: -2.24%\n* VIX: +15.51%\n* AAPL: +3.24%\n\nJ. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. \n\nPowell said, ““We tend to use \\[the word transitory\\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”\n\nOriginally, Central Bank officials hoped inflation would begin moderating in the second-half of 2021, something that has not happened. Instead, prices rose 6.2% in October, the fastest annual rise in the Consumer Price Index since 1990. The Personal Consumption Expenditures, which serve as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation came in 5% higher. Powell said the “risk of higher inflation has increased,” but reiterated that his baseline expectation is for inflation to fall closer to the central bank’s 2% target over the course of 2022.\n\nAdding salt to the wound, vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. \n\nHe said, “There is no world, I think, where \\[the effectiveness\\] is the same level we had with \\[the\\] Delta \\[variant\\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.\n\nVivek Paul, BlackRock Investment Institution Chief Investment Strategist said, “Information is coming rapidly, it's evolving in real-time. You can understand why investors \\[last week\\] were taking a little bit of a pause, particularly given the liquidity situation we had going into the U.S. holiday season. We think on balance, it would make sense to be invested in the markets at this moment in time. It's all about understanding whether or not this is a delay, or a derailment, of the restart that we've seen. And it seems most likely at this moment — notwithstanding more information to come— that it looks like a delay.” I agree, it’s important to acknowledge risks present in the markets but it is not time to panic yet, we simply do not have enough information yet. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) introduced two new custom designed computer chips aimed at competing with data center chips from Intel (INTC), NVIDIA (NVDA), and AMD. \n* Goldman Sachs (GS) unveils new Amazon-backed cloud trading service for Wall Street firms. The bank is opening up access to its trove of market data and software tools to hedge funds and asset managers in an offering designed with Amazon’s cloud division.\n* The Omicron variant took crude oil firmly into bear market territory, with WTI crude futures falling to $67 a barrel, a -19.46% decline since recent highs earlier in the month. \n* Consumer Confidence dropped to 109.5 in November, missing estimates of 110.9 and a marked drop from 113.8 in October, according to a closely watched report by the Conference Board. [https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm](https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm)\n* Jack Dorsey announced he will be stepping down as CEO of social media Twitter (TWTR), giving the lead role to Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal. In my opinion, this is good news for Twitter, given they will now have more focused leadership. Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Square (SQ) has a lot on his plate.\n* Meta Platforms (FB) was told to sell animated message company Giphy by UK regulators, citing potential anti-competition concerns. \n* According to a survey of 1000 auto industry executives, KPMG found that execs expect electric vehicles will make up roughly 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030. \n* Stock of Alibaba (BABA) continues its death spiral, reaching its lowest level in over four years, with the stock down more than 60% from its previous all-time high amid an intense regulatory crackdown by the CCP. \n* Tesla (TSLA) announced its latest software update allows in-car purchases and subscriptions for vehicle owners. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AutoZone (AZO) target raised by Wells Fargo from $1825 to $2050 at Overweight.
