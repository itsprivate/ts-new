Analysts were expecting sales growth of 18% for the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n\n“We are not satisfied with the results we are delivering, regardless of the current headwinds,” the company said in the letter.\n\nIt’s the latest chapter in a tough year for Snap, whose stock has lost almost two-thirds of its value in 2022. In May, Snap said it wouldn’t [meet](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/24/snaps-down-32percent-and-its-dragging-other-stocks-down-with-it.html) the second-quarter guidance it set the prior month, leading to a [43% plunge](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/24/snaps-down-32percent-and-its-dragging-other-stocks-down-with-it.html) in the share price. At the time, Snap cited a macroeconomic environment that was deteriorating much faster than expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven with the reduced guidance, Snap still missed estimates. Revenue increased 13% from a year ago, while analysts were expecting growth of 16%.\n\n“The second quarter of 2022 proved more challenging than we expected,” Snap said in the investor letter. The company said it now plans to “substantially slow our rate of hiring, as well as the rate of operating expense growth.”\n\nSnap attributed its disappointing results to slowing demand for its online ad platform. Additionally, a challenging economy, Apple’s 2021 iOS update and increased competition from companies like TikTok have led marketers to pull back on their spending.\n\nSnap said that even some relatively healthy businesses were curbing their commitments because of the “input cost pressure due to inflation.”\n\n“In certain high-growth sectors, businesses are reassessing investment levels amid the rising cost of capital, which is further reflected in campaign budgets and the level of bids per action,” Snap said.\n\nSnap also announced a stock repurchasing program of up to $500 million. And for their new employment contracts, Spiegel and Murphy will receive an annual salary of $1 and no equity compensation.\n\nEarlier this week, Snap [debuted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/18/snapchat-is-coming-to-the-web-after-more-than-a-decade-as-a-mobile-app.html) Snapchat for Web, a desktop version of the mobile Snapchat app that people can use to send messages and make video calls with their Snap contacts.\n\nSnap revealed new desktop app shortly after it [debuted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-plus-subscription-plan-price-release.html) its Snapchat+ paid subscription plan, which costs $3.99 a month and lets people access early features and see who has viewed their Snaps.  \n\nInvestors will soon get a clearer picture of the online ad environment. Twitter is set to report results Friday morning, followed by Alphabet and Meta next week.\n\n[(source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/21/snap-earnings-q2-2022.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
