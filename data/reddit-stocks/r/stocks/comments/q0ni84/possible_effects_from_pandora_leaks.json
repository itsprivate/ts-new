[Their clients include](https://www.alcogal.com/clients/) Credit Suisse, Citi, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, P&G, among others.\n\nI wanted to know how similar leaks affected to market in the past and I'm wondering if a similar trend will happen as a result of the Pandora leak.\n\nThe Panama papers saw [markets diminishing market cap](https://hbr.org/2016/05/the-market-punished-panama-papers-firms-to-the-tune-of-230-billion) of companies associated with these kind of offshoring firms.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n>What it might mean is that [investors believe] corporations may face punishment for too aggressive or even illegal tax avoidance or even tax evasion.\n\nNow in terms of market cap, these were large companies. From the above article:\n\n>We find that firms with exposure to any of these major havens lost roughly $230 billion in market capitalization. The economic magnitude is rather stunning. It’s along the lines of $200 million per firm on average. However, all of these are large firms, so this reflects roughly 0.5% of market capitalization of these firms.\n\nI don't quite remember the political climate in 2016. But I'm interested to hear if people think that this is a bad time for the market to get this kind of news, or if this is really a drop in the bucket with everything going on, or if you don't think it will really impact the market that significantly. It looks like this article was based on a paper released less than a month after the Panama papers were released, so I'm fairly certain investors reacted quickly to the news.\n\nWhat's your take? I'm fairly new to this stuff but my game has been taking geopolitical events and trying to understand their impacts on the markets.\n\nThanks!",
