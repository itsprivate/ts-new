My gut tells me that TSLA is not more valuable than all the world’s other car companies combined.  They have first-mover advantage in EVs but I feel like other car companies will close this gap quickly.  Established manufacturers have the infrastructure in place and after some initial costs and challenges converting to EV I think at least some will emerge as viable contenders.  This leads me to question tsla share price over the next decade, as they no longer are the only really impressive EV.  This is just a gut feeling I would love to hear better insight either way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
