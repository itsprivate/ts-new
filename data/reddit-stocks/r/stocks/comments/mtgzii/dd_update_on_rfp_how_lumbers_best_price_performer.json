  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I posted a DD on RFP a month ago.  Since then this stock has surged almost 60%, including an epic 15% jump last Friday when the housing starts numbers were published and showed massive increase in construction since February; which I said it would a month ago.  </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been getting a lot of messages recently asking if this stock is still worth buying or what’s my PT.  I am not going to suggest a PT or tell anyone whether they should buy this stock or when to sell if they bought it.  Everyone has their own risk tolerance and investing style.  </p>\n\n<p>However, I am willing share the main data points (positive and negative) that I have so far focused on which will explain why I haven’t sold any of my shares yet, nor plan to in the next few weeks.  If you see flaws in the data/analysis, please share.  I am not a financial analyst.  I can’t give you advice.  I am just going to share with you why I am still sticking with this stock.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Brief History Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you want a brief history description on this company, you can go to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m8tj0f/dd_on_rfp_a_lumber_value_play_poised_to_have_its/\">my old DD on it</a></p>\n\n<p>The only thing I will add: here’s a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-04-15/lumber-prices-are-rising-like-i-have-never-seen-before-stinson-dean-video\">very recent interview</a> from a lumber distributor/trader giving a good interview on why lumber is so high, and will continue to be high for a while.  If you look at analyst projections for the major homebuilders, like LEN, DHI, TOL, etc… they all expect the homebuilders to see continuously increasing earnings for this year and 2022.  If they plan on building like crazy for the foreseeable future, that’s great news for companies like RFP.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Present Day Conditions</strong></p>\n\n<p>YTD RFP is up 126% and 812% for the year.  As with any stock, the higher it climbs, the more you should expect resistance (little dips) from profit taking.  There may be a dip on Monday after last Friday’s insane rally.  When I posted in March that this was an undervalued stock, there were many people saying the lumber surge was over and the stock had peaked.  They were wrong :). Now let’s look at what’s changed in the last 30 days now that the stock is up 60% since then.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bear Case Considerations</strong></p>\n\n<p>I want to start with possible downsides to consider.  First, this stock is almost now trading at its 5 year high  (Current price – 14.78; 5-year High was 15.50 in 2018).  The stock hasn’t traded in the 20s and 30s in over a half a decade.  So expect more turbulence and resistance on the way there.</p>\n\n<p>Second, this is a cyclical stock.  Cyclicals do great until they don’t.  This stock will likely start a decline right before the decline in earnings shows up in an earnings statement.  A great analogy for exit strategies on cyclicals is: You want to leave the party while you’re still having fun.  To see a great example this, look at RFP’s stock price trajectory in Fall 2018, right before it’s Q3 earnings announcement on November 2, 2018.  Q3 was its best earnings for the year, but the stock was already declining from its 52WK high because lumber and wood pulp prices were crashing prior to that November announcement.  </p>\n\n<p>Third, the trailing PE is now ~135.  So there is absolutely some futures earning priced in at this point.  However, for reason’s I’ll explain later, this PE is very misleading because of an accounting quirk from Q4 2020. </p>\n\n<p>Four, dimensional lumber already has surged over 300% to ~ $1200-1300 MBF in the cash markets.  While those prices may surge a tiny bit more in the next couple months, it’s highly unlikely that there will be much more growth in price; a very important consideration for a cyclical stock.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth, who the heck knows what Covid still has in store, if anything.  There was a recent lockdown order for Ontario (where some RFP facilities are) due to a spike in Covid cases.  Things like this could cut into RFP’s bottom line.  Hard to say how much if at all.</p>\n\n<p>Sixth, they still have some pension liabilities that need to be paid for and will certainly mute the full impact of earnings (meaning less re-investment or less dividend potential) until these liabilities are fully paid off.  These pension liabilities could be a major factor decreasing the perceived fair value of the stock in the eyes of the institutional investors/HF’s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why The Bear Case Doesn’t Scare Me Yet</strong></p>\n\n<p>1)  I like Peter Lynch’s perspective that past performance doesn’t guarantee future performance.  800% growth doesn’t mean it will stop growing nor does it mean the stock will continue to grow.  What matters is whether the future earnings coming down the road justify further growth.  If they do, stay the course.</p>\n\n<p>2)  While the pattern of cyclicals means there will be a peak and a drop from that peak, what’s different with this particular company is that it was trading at ridiculous lows, and if they finish paying off their debt this year (which I think they will), that combined with the improvements they’ve made in 2020 and 2021, the resting run rate of this stock has a good chance of being higher than it was before this cycle started.  If it does, and you ask me how much higher will than normal run rate be? I have no fucking clue.  Anyone who claims to is talking out of their ass. </p>\n\n<p>3)  The trailing PE is high, and a good portion of Q1 earnings is priced in, but I don’t think it’s fully priced in for two reasons.  First, in Q4 RFP did an $80 Million writeoff for the idling of two newsprint mills—a one-time accounting expense that wasn’t a literal cash expenditure—which put them in the negative for that quarter and a EPS of 10 cents for 2020.  <em>If you remove that write off, their current PE would be in the ballpark of 13-14.</em>  </p>\n\n<p>Second, Q1’s average projected EPS is $1.66.  I think they will beat it, but let’s say they don’t.  Then the trailing EPS will be $1.77 and give you a PE of 8.3 at the current price.  If you go for the adjusted PE that doesn’t include the writeoff, that would make the trailing EPS about ~$2.77 which would give an adjusted TTM PE of 5.33 at current price.  So, either way the company is still undervalued when Q1 earnings gets added in.</p>\n\n<p>4)  Dimensional lumber will probably hit its peak in the next couple months.  That being said, because of what’s driving this massive surge in prices (massive growth in housing construction and remodeling), unlike in 2018, I don’t think the price will drop fast after it hits the peak.  Consistent with that, if you look at <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#\">dimensional lumber futures here</a>, you can see that the futures market right now is expecting lumber to stay 2-3x it’s 2019 price for the rest of year, and possibly into 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Valuation Metrics compared to other Lumber Players</strong></p>\n\n<p>Even with the awesome rally in the last month, here’s RFP valuation ratios</p>\n\n<pre><code>RFP\nP/E             135\nForward P/E     3.86\nPrice/Sales       .42\nPrice/Book      1.19\nPrice/Cash flow 6.57\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let’s compare RFP’s ratios to similar forestry/lumber producers (WFG, WY, LPX, IFSPF and CFPZF) (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/syWoh0F\">Link to screenshot</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Forestry/Lumber Avg\nP/E               15.2\nForward P/E       10.1\nPrice/Sales       2.1\nPrice/Book         4.4\nPrice/Cash flow   11.4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Takeaways: 1) RFP <em>still</em> has the best forward PE, price-to-sales ratio, price-to-book ratio. 2) It has the highest trailing PE, but again, if you remove the newsprint mill write-off, it is actually sitting right below the average, 3) Interfor and Canfor have slightly better price-to-cashflow, but RFP is substantially better than WY, WFG, and LPX.  Overall, RFP still has the best overall ratio picture and best forward-looking position, even after this 60% rally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Bullish Case for 2021</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am not going repeat what I wrote in the last post.  To see the things I listed to support a bull case a month ago, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m8tj0f/dd_on_rfp_a_lumber_value_play_poised_to_have_its/\">here’s the link</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Future Lumber outlook has dramatically improved but analysts haven’t yet accounted for it.</em></p>\n\n<p>Myself and other RFP longs have been banging our heads for months now, because the 4 analysts who cover RFP so far still refuse to acknowledge the complete reality of the surge in lumber prices.  <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/qepFiqC\">Here’s a snapshot of average analyst quarterly EPS projections for 2021</a>.  If you look up the other lumber stocks, they make all the same projections of mediocre Q2 and then Q3/Q4 dropping off hard.  </p>\n\n<p>The issue is that the avg lumber price for Q1 will probably fall in the ballpark of 800-950.  (Remember there is a 9% duty for the lumber produced in Canada).  However, the avg price for Q2 will absolutely be over $1000 MBF.  So profits from lumber should be higher in Q2 than Q1.  And given the volume and price surge for the futures in the Q3 months (July futures currently trading over $1100 MBF), Q3 will almost certainly have a higher EPS than Q1, much less the current analysts’ projections for Q3.</p>\n\n<p>Also, by end of June, RFP’s three US mills they bought in 2020 should be running at full capacity according to the last earnings transcript.  At full capacity they increase the companies lumber production by ~25%.  So this only further adds to the extra sales/profit to be expect after Q2, compared to Q1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But here’s a decent way for you to do your own math for the value of the lumber segment:</strong></p>\n\n<p>For RFP, assume $400 costs USD. There may be a few other costs to factor in, but not that much. May be $50 for longer shipping distances or whatnot. So, at $1000 MBF, you get about $500 cash margins.  At $1200 (which is still lower than the current cash price) you get $700 cash margins.</p>\n\n<p>RFP will probably produce around 2.5 billion feet of lumber, so prices of $1000 per thousand feet let’s you do the math. I’d use a lower realization given the duty and we don’t know yet how Q4 will look.  So let’s call it $900 avg for year. So that roughly gives us margins of $450 USD per thousand feet on 2.5 billion of feet. So that’s <strong>$1.12B in cash earnings — or about $14/share — for 2021.</strong>  Depreciation/Amortization should take a chuck of that away so I don’t think that will be pure GAAP net income.  But still, pretty decent for a stock currently valued at $14.78, or a market cap of 1.2 billion.  <em>And that’s just the lumber segment.</em>  </p>\n\n<p>So for those wondering if the party is over, ask yourself, how many companies are likely to produce their current market cap in EBITDA in the next year from just <em>one</em> of their business segments…? Food for thought on the current valuation. : )</p>\n\n<p><em>But Wait, there’s More!</em></p>\n\n<p>Putting aside all the cash the lumber segment is printing, the Paper and Pulp sectors also appear to be doing well and likely will boost profits in Q2/Q3, at a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the current prices of paper and wood pulp are much more opaque and harder to preemptively track.  However, there are some limited free resources out there and they seem to show upward trajectory starting at the beginning of Q1 and continuing to grow in Q2, which means we should expect higher Paper/Pulp profits in Q2, and Q3 if trend holds.  Since it is harder for me to figure out all the drivers of this surge (beyond economy reopening and China’s ban on non-degradable single-use plastics), I don’t have the confidence to look beyond Q3 for now on these two areas.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of what I use to try and get a feel for these two areas: </p>\n\n<p>1)  The closest thing to a futures market indicator for pulp. (<a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices\">Shanghai Futures Market</a>)  The value is in yuan so you have to convert the currency yourself.  It is a relatively recent and speculative market, but it so far has generally done a decent job of acting as a mirror of the general wood pulp market.  As long as these futures are up, that’s a decent indicator of what’s currently going on in pulp world generally.</p>\n\n<p>2)  There are couple of analysts who give little tidbits when companies, including RFP and its competitors, announce price increases on pulp. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en\">I follow this editor</a>.  I don’t pay for his service.  But if you scroll through his feed (or search twitter for the terms “NBSK price” and “SBSK Price” you’ll see his tweets in the last few months announcing price increases to RFP’s two main types of pulp in the last few months, both by RFP and its competitors. If you do that, you’ll see big price increases being announced, many of which are effective during Q2.  So I expect Q2 and beyond to do better than Q1 in those areas as well.</p>\n\n<p>3)  For Paper, this one is the hardest.  This was a <a href=\"https://www.specialtyprintcomm.com/blog/paper-market-update-paper-prices-continue-increase/\">recent article</a> that talks about the type of paper RFP produces and that indicates prices are going up.  But beyond that, as the economy opens back up, paper profits are expected to increase from 2020 levels.  So I think this will get better over the next few quarters, compared to last year.  </p>\n\n<p>Overall, it’s hard to say for sure what this means for true earnings for the year, but in terms of how I am planning my own exit strategies on this stock, I think there are major upward revisions coming to analyst projections after Q1 Earnings on April 29 and probably again during the summer, largely because lumber’s historically increased price probably isn’t going away any time soon.   </p>\n\n<p><em>RFP has a major additional earnings booster hiding in its financials which aren’t reflected in the valuation metrics but will be in the next few quarters</em></p>\n\n<p>Here’s an awesome nugget I recently realized that isn’t reflected in the valuation ratios, but I think it will help propel the book value/EV of RFP‘s earnings and the ultimate EPS.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/tzwjlhM\">a screenshot of RFP’s 2020 10-K, specifically it’s deferred tax assets</a>.  If you don’t know what a deferred tax asset is, especially loss carryforwards, google it or watch a Youtube video on it.  If you don’t know what valuation allowance, it’s <strong>very important</strong> you look it up to understand this bit.  </p>\n\n<p>Essentially, because of the massive losses RFP sustained over the last decade while it transformed itself, it has over $800 million dollars in loss carryforwards and tax credits which it can use to pay virtually no taxes on the likely 100s of millions of dollars in earnings it will generate in the immediate future.  </p>\n\n<p>Here’s the real critical point, those carryforward losses largely aren’t reflected in the book value/enterprise value of the company because of that 774-million-dollar valuation allowance which was essentially a write off of those deferred tax assets. </p>\n\n<p>Meaning, as RFP starts to generate more earnings, some of that valuation allowance will likely be undone, so that the loss carryforwards can be used, and when it does, the reversal of those valuation allowances will look like extra earnings/EPS on the books. Meaning, if they remove $160 million of VA to account for the use of the same DTA’s to avoid paying taxes on 2021 earnings, that will look like an extra $2 EPS for 2021.  Given that the current enterprise value is only 1.63 billion, if the total valuation allowance was reversed tomorrow that would cause an immediate increase in their enterprise value of  47% and would look like a net income of $9.69 EPS….</p>\n\n<p>RFP probably isn’t going to do it all at once but that gives you a sense of the scale of net income that will be added to RFP’s books in the coming quarters/years as they generate profits and RFP removes the valuation allowance negating the book value of the DTAs they previously wrote-off.</p>\n\n<p><em>If the Canadian Lumber tariff is removed, this would result in an instant windfall for RFP.</em></p>\n\n<p>I’ve been asked how the politics of the tariff could affect RFP.  The answer is, it would be incredible for RFP if the tariff is removed. Right now, pressure is building from the homebuilders associations and from Canada to have the US remove the 9% tariff on Canadian lumber. I have no clue when or if this will happen and won’t speculate on that issue.</p>\n\n<p>BUT, if the tariff is removed, RFP gets all the money it has set aside to pay future duties.  At end of Q4, that was $243 million (<a href=\"https://www.resolutefp.com/uploadedFiles/Investors/Financial_Reports/2020_10-K_Resolute-RFP.pdf?v=1\">See Page 4 of their 2020 10-k</a>). That comes to just over $3 of EPS, which is quite significant given that the average analyst projection for net income for the year is $4 EPS… </p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: This stock has been kicking ass for a reason and I think will continue to do so.  I can’t predict the future, but I haven’t sold a share yet and will continue to keep a majority of my portfolio in this stock for the next 1-2 quarters <em>at a minimum,</em> because of the massive earnings they are/will be generating.  I don’t think the true future earnings of 2021 are priced in yet by analyst PTs or the current stock price.</p>\n\n<p>Note:  I am not a financial advisor/analyst.  Please do your own research and make your own decisions if this company is under or overvalued.  I am sharing my thoughts with you because the mainstream financial media gives dogshit advice on how to invest in lumber.  </p>\n\n<p>I’m long RFP in both shares and long term calls.  Don’t ask me for a PT, I’m not gonna give you one.  Don’t ask me if you should buy it, when you should buy it or when you should sell it.  You have to make those decisions for yourself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
