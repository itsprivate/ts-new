Many people now are panicking cause stocks like MGNI or NIO are plummeting, but if you hold BB do not panic. The company is nothing of its former self and l would be disappointed in anyone that does not take advantage of this dip (sale). It just ticks me that one of the few companies whose valuation is relatively low is being compared to a meme stock. BB is a diamond in the dirt, just waiting to shine. DO your own DD and research but please do not compare MGNI or NIO to BB. That&#39;s just inaccurate.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
