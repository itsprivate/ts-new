Which will put USA GDP in the negative range easily. \n\nI personally sold all of my positions today in pre-market as I do not have high hopes for the 2nd quarter GDP. Let's assume we get a positive GDP by a fringe , I don't think the stock market will rally significantly upwards as things just doesnt look good with inflation and the feds possibly raising the interest rate. However, if the GDP happens to turn out negative I'm pretty sure all hell will break loose. There are just too much downside risks holding on to our position than upsides in the market right now.\n\nSo what are your thoughts? Are you still holding on to your positions doing dca or, have you sold some of your position while awaiting for results.",
