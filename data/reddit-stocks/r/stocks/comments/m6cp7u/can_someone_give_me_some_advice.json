I read alot in there about the stock market and various other things to educate myself but mainly how to make money legally. I got out 2019 with a newfound confidence and began working and investing every penny I had building my credit to &quot;excellent&quot;  and was doing GREAT. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward 2021, I&#39;m married with 3 dependents and ive had to pull all my investing money for emergencies  and had quit investing for a while throughout 2020. Ive been trying to invest again but have had the absolute worst luck in doing so recently...</p>\n\n<p>I work 2 jobs + day labor when I can and it&#39;s barely enough to scrape by. Once the rent/bills are paid I have around $200 left for gas,food, etc. This leaves nothing to invest so I took advantage of these last stimulus and have lost about 30% of it since investing again.  </p>\n\n<p>I had a dream I could turn this 2k into 10k to invest in the SPY and safe growth etfs/stocks and I&#39;m just watching the little money I have dwindle away. I&#39;m just tired of being broke and not being able to provide for my family like I want to. I wanna buy my mom a house 1 day, I wanna own a house for the family I started and the stock market seemed like the only way for a collosal fuck up with no education to have a decent life. </p>\n\n<p>So what should I do? Pull the little money I have left and buy a handful of etfs to check back on in 10 years? Or should i Shut my little bitch ass up and work 4 jobs for the next 30 years?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
