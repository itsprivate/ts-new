  "selftext": "The rally in equities somewhat cooled today, with all three major indexes trading modestly red today but are on track to close out a stellar month, with the S&P 500 (SPY) gaining more than 2.5% in August, its seven straight month of gains. So far, the SPY is up a staggering 20% year-to-date. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech by Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants await a busy week for new economic data, with the August Jobs Report due out on Thursday.\n\nBMO Capital Markets became the latest financial firm to raise its end of the year price target for the SPY. Brian Belski, the company’s Chief Investment Strategist, wrote in a note to clients that he now expects the index to end the year at $480, up from his original estimate of $450. He cites the “blistering rate” of corporate earnings amid a strengthening economic backdrop. \n\nDespite hawkish statements by other Federal Reserve members in the July meeting minutes, in his speech Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, “At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue.”\n\nPowell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would “arrive after the need has passed” and “could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, “The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.”\n\nHere is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It’s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy-maker thinks of the current state of the economy\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)\n\nJames Liu, Founder and CEO of Clearnomics, said of Powell’s speech, “We do think that tapering, in general, will be a non-event, most likely because first, the market has had time to react throughout this year. The Fed has done a great job telegraphing this. Whether it’s September or November for the announcement of taper will really depend on the jobs report coming up and some more economic data. But regardless, the market seems to expect it at this point. This is very different from 2013 when the market had to adjust very abruptly to taper.” In my humble opinion, I totally agree with this sentiment.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* U.S. home prices surged by the most in 30 years at the beginning of this summer as tight inventory levels and elevated demand combined to drag on affordability. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index jumped 18.6% in June over last year, accelerating from a 16.8% rise in May. This also marked the 13th straight month of accelerating price increases.\n* Footwear startup Allbirds, which is known for making shoes with only environmentally safe and sustainable materials, filed to go public via IPO. Its backers include Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Adidas, which has partnered with the company to make a range of sustainable sneakers. \n* The intense regulatory crackdown in China continues. Yesterday, the Chinese Communist Party announced minors were forbidden to play video games for more than three hours a week (only on the weekends). Recently, state media has been rallying against video games, calling them “spiritual opium”. The restrictions apply to any devices including phones and are a massive blow to the global gaming industry that caters to tens of millions of young players in the world's most lucrative market.\n* Shares of Zoom (ZM, the defining work from home stock, slid more than 15% after reporting earnings due to concerns of growth slowing down.\n* Tesla (TSLA) received regulatory approval from the Indian government that certifies all car models as “roadworthy”. This is big as India is the world’s second-most populous country.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Fundamental Research from $144 to $164 at Buy.
