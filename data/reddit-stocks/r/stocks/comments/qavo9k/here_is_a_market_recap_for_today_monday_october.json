  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 18, 2021**\n\nThe market carried on its incredible momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) bouncing for the fourth straight day to add to gains after experiencing the first -5% decline all year. Technology stocks, which have recently been pressured by a rising Treasury yield, came back with a vengeance, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) jumping roughly 6% from October 4 lows. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected uptick in retail sales despite a new report showing inflation rose once again in September amid widespread supply-chain disruptions. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest corporate earnings report, with many notable companies like Tesla (TSLA), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Netflix (NFLX), and Intel (INTC) among many others reporting later this week. \n\nNot to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip and the recent bounce highlights why. While I acknowledge current risk factors that exist in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in “doomsaying” headlines from mass media, doesn’t mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero-margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.\n\nA strong start to earnings season, with big banks handily beating estimates last week, helped fuel optimism that corporate profits held up better than anticipated despite widespread supply-related disruptions. Big banks from Morgan Stanley (MS) to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) handily topped estimates in their third quarter results last week. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. \n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA)\n\nVictoria Fernandez, Chief Market Strategist at Crossmark Global Investments said, “We started off this week really strong. The banks have done great ... That started to relieve a few people's concerns, especially when you had the CEOs of the bank saying the consumer looks strong. And that, I think, is going to be the key for the market going forward. If the consumer is there and they're willing to spend — which we've seen in the month of September \\[when\\] retail sales started to come back a little bit — then I think that gives a little more optimism to the market that as we continue to reopen, as earnings are strong, the consumer will be there, and the equity markets will continue to trend higher.\"\n\nLast week, The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  “The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.” \n\nAs of Friday, the expected earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 was 30%, according to FactSet. That figure — based on both actual earnings from companies that have reported so far and expectations for future results — represented an increase from the prior week, when the anticipated earnings growth rate for the third quarter stood at about 27.6%.\n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_101521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_101521.pdf)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) unveiled new versions of its Macbook Pro laptops that use their proprietary M1 chip, making them more powerful than the predecessors that used Intel (INTC) chips.\n* Optimism among U.S. homebuilders posted a surprise jump in October, with strong demand for homes helping offset ongoing supply chain and labor issues in the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders' October Housing Market Index jumped to 80 in October from 76 in September. This index, which tracks confidence among domestic homebuilders, was expected to fall to 75 in the latest reading, according to Bloomberg consensus data.\n* Alibaba (BABA) is reportedly planning to build its own in-house chip using a 5nm wafer designed using Arm architecture in a bid to strengthen its position in the cloud computing market.\n* Arm, which is the midst of a potential $54 billion take over by NVIDIA (NVDA) announced new tools aim at cutting the development time of connected devices by up to 40%. Arm on Monday released tools that it hopes will let makers of \"internet of things\" devices, from connected traffic control lights to smart home appliances, develop their chips and code at the same time, shaving two years off the typical five-year timeline to create a device. Arm is one of the most important tech companies, I recommend everyone read up on them. \n* Amazon (AMZN) hired 150,000 seasonal workers as the holiday season, the busiest of the year, kicks off.\n* Facebook (FB) plan to hire 10,000 employees in EU to develop the “metaverse”, a virtual, 3-D, collective, integrated space where users can interact online using VR. \n* Ford Motors (F) plans to invest $300 million to build an electric vehicle plant in the UK.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) target raised by JP Morgan from $237 to $276 at Overweight.
