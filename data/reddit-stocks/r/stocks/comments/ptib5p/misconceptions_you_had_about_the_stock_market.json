However, the first character is pronounced exactly as the same as the term for “drum” (“gǔ,” although the written character is different). When I first learned about the market in Chinese, I kept thinking it meant “drum ticket” and used my own wild imaginations to picture what such a thing would look like.\n\n- The first time I heard “Dow Jones,” I thought it was “Down Jones” and immediately jumped to the conclusion that the market must be called “Up Jones” on days when it went up. When “Up Jones” never appeared, I wondered why people would keep calling it “Down Jones” when the price clearly was going up.\n\n- The first time I watched business news covering the market (pre-Internet days), I had no idea what was causing these stock prices to go up or down. I just thought all these companies were scoring points in some kind of game, so I kept waiting for the toy companies to show up just to see their scores.\n\nYours?",
