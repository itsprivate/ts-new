Amazon (AMZN) cost the shorts $5.8 billion, according to S3.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the shorts were forced to admit defeat last year. About two-thirds of the short positions were unwound during 2020, which in itself was a factor that helped drive Tesla shares higher, as the short investors were forced to buy higher-priced shares to exit their positions.</p>\n\n<p>But the year ended with short investors still holding roughly 5.5% of Tesla&#39;s shares, which equates to a $31 billion bet against the company&#39;s future prospects. For comparison, there is $13.3 billion and $10.2 billion currently bet against Apple and Amazon respectively, with shorts controlling less than 1% of each of those companies&#39; stocks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
