The FactSet consensus was for a 16-cent loss on a per-share basis.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Total revenue rose to $285.6 million from $171.5 million. Analysts tracked by FactSet were anticipating $279 million in revenue.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The company said it added a “record” of 523,000 new members during the fourth quarter. It also added 906,000 new products. Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev noted that additions on both metrics were up sequentially.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;SoFi [recently won approval for a national banking charter](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sofi-stock-shoots-toward-best-day-in-nearly-a-year-banking-approval-cheered-as-significant-driver-11642623155?mod=search_headline&amp;mod=article_inline), and the company expects that incremental net interest income from its SoFi Bank will “only contribute nominally” to its results for the first quarter. SoFi expects a greater impact after it begins fully originating loans in its in-house bank, something that’s expected to take place this May. \n\n [SoFi stock soars after fintech company gives upbeat earnings outlook - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sofi-stock-soars-after-fintech-company-gives-upbeat-earnings-outlook-11646171525)",
