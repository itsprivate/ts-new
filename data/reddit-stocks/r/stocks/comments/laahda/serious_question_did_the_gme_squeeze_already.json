Then I found this information a few hours ago, and it has me worried for the people indefinitely holding, with the expectation of a squeeze coming soon. I&#39;m new to the stock market but have learned a bit in the last week. Am I reading this wrong, or have the percentage of shorted shares dropped to 49.21%?</p>\n\n<p>If the squeeze already happened last friday, how is lying about it or hiding this information to keep people buying/holding GME stock, to increase personal profits, ANY different then the bullshit that Hedge Funds do? That is active manipulation and deception for personal gain, not an altruistic attempt to &#39;take down Goliath&#39;, which is why many people (myself included) supported/support the GME/AMC fight.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Even ASKING for people to explain this information to me has resulted in mass downvotes, ZERO direct responses explaining why I am wrong, and a post I made about it on WSB, was deleted within 30 seconds by mods. No explanation was provided for the quick deletion, and after asking why it was deleted, I was ignored. (edit - AND Shadowbanned, as I recently just noticed.)</p>\n\n<p>Is this a &quot;David vs. Goliath&quot; type of fight, or essentially a Ponzi scheme for people who invested early and/or with large funds?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Am I crazy/wrong, or is ignorance and greed now fueling this &#39;movement&#39;? <strong><em>ANY</em></strong> explanation is greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>edit- Shoutout to the mods here for reinstating this post after it was initially removed. The mods over at WSB shadowbanned me after I asked the same question.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
