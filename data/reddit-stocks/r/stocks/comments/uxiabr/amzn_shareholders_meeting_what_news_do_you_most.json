  "selftext": "Amazon stock was one of the first stocks hit by the great sell-off in retail. Pity it’s not really a retailer.\n\nThe stock was due to open May 23 at $2,177, a market capitalization of just $1.09 trillion. You can say “just” in this case because it has lost 35% of its value this year. That's thanks largely to a May wipe-out that took shares from $2,900 to $2,100 in two weeks. It was last at this level in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAmazon's retail sales rate is second only to mighty Walmart , and its stock has fallen alongside other retail names. But retailing, for all its size, is only incidental to the Amazon story. It is, and remains, a tech stock, with the broadest offering of any of the Cloud Czars.\n\nAmazon's next big trick?\n\nThe purpose of Amazon’s store operations is to create cash flow it can invest in cloud data centers and other infrastructure. While Target results can be measured based on sales and store margins, Amazon is much bigger and broader.\n\nAmazon’s cash flow has been hit hard by the retail downturn. It was “only” $39.3 billion for the 12 months ending in March. For the quarter operating cash flow was even negative, by $2.8 billion.\n\nThe stock's fall was not unjustified. But investors buy tomorrow, not yesterday. Cash flow should rise in the next quarters thanks to advertising. Amazon brought in $7.87 billion from ads in the last quarter, up 23% from a year ago. By way of comparison, Paramount Global brought in $5.4 billion in TV ads for all of 2021.\n\nMost Amazon ads are inside the store, text and pictures for third-party sellers using its infrastructure. But Freevee, formerly IMDB TV, can now compete directly with other TV networks. Amazon is creating shows specifically for the channel, along with hosting older network shows such as Mad Men. With its own app, Freevee can also run on any streaming platform.\n\nFreevee takes advantage of the fact that Amazon’s Fire streaming stick has 36% of the U.S. market and 6.4% worldwide. Freevee can also advertise Amazon’s Alexa speakers, which have a 26% share of their market.\n\nThe fact that Amazon has big competitors in all these areas, from Samsung and Roku in streaming, to Alphabet and Apple in speakers, to Apple and Walt Disney in TV, also gives Amazon an argument against a break-up.\n\nAll this goes on top of its ad-free Prime TV streams, second only to Netflix in that market at 19%. Netflix, meanwhile, rents capacity from Amazon Web Services.\n\nAWS powers the whole magilla. The decision in 2005 to rent its cloud infrastructure, as it rents its warehouse and delivery capacity, may be the smartest business move ever made. AWS still has one-third of the cloud services market, as much as Microsoft and Alphabet combined.  \n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amzn-stock-next-big-trick-1031487809](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amzn-stock-next-big-trick-1031487809)\n\nWhat news would you most like to see?\n\nWhat do you think is the big thing today?",
