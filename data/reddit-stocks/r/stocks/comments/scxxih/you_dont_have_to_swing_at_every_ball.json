Noticed many YouTube videos and news articles encouraging people to buy the dip indiscriminately. I thought this quote will remind people that you don't have to FOMO every time a stock's price goes down. While macro events have somewhat screwed up fundamentals, I think the stock market is still overvalued. I\"m sitting on 35% in cash but will only swing when I see a good opportunity otherwise no deal.",
