In this market you can’t predict anything , i am just thinking out loud from what i have seen the last couple months . Based on that opinion i will take short term trades with puts running to the fomc and swapping it to calls mins before . \nMight not be a perfectly fit post for this sub but yolo.\n\nThis is obviously not financial advise.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add , i will trade based on how the Market reacts before FOMC. If the Market keeps being green up to FOMC i will double my puts. I tend to close the trade eod.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
