CVS also said it plans to increase its yearly dividend by 10%.\n\nThe owner of CVS pharmacies and Aetna health insurance said it will work to make health care more convenient, personalized and affordable for consumers. The company last month said it would close 300 stores a year over the next three years and take a charge of as much as $1.2 billion, part of a plan to decrease its store density in some areas.\n\nCompany executives plan to provide further details on its accelerating push into primary care at an investor day on Thursday, CVS pharmacy-benefits executive Alan Lotvin said in an interview. After positive early results in caring for patients with kidney disease, the pharmacy giant is continuing to look for new therapeutic areas enter and ways to grow beyond drugstores that are seeing diminished traffic.\n\n[...]\n\nThe planned buyback will be used to at least offset share count dilution next year, CVS said. It’s the first time it has increased its dividend or repurchased stock since 2017.\n\nShares are up ~4% at time of writing.",
