  "selftext": "Those who've been following the cannabis industry, knows that Tilray's recent trading performance has been underwhelming. In my opinion, the biggest hurdle to the company's trading performance is due to the Canadian adult recreational industry wide challenge along with covid-related retail headwinds. There's been struggles for the Canadian cannabis LPs to generate growth organically within the adult recreational segment. For example, while Tilray, market leader in Canadian adult recreational, generated 26% topline growth from $405 million in 2020 to $513 million in 2021, much of that topline growth is derived from acquisitions. In other words, Tilray's recent revenue growth were \"bought\" instead of generated organically as the market expands. Low growth within the segment along with some structural challenges and covid-related shut-downs further negatively impacted the industry's outlook and profitability, resulting in depressing trading performances.\n\nAs cannabis companies remain illegal in the United States at a federal level and debt capital raising are off the table as a result, Canadian cannabis LPs relies on equity issuance to fund acquisition opportunities to \"grow\" their toplines. Result of both stagnant growth and share dilution, Tilray traded down from $40 in February 2021 to $10 last close. Tilray's TTM EV/Sales declined from 40x to 10x. For a growth company within a quickly expanding market that's only 3 years old, 10x TTM sales EV is a good price in my opinion. What makes it even more attractive is that there's a catalyst that the market has dismissed and forgotten that will completely derail the stagnant market growth narrative for Tilray.\n\nGermany's new coalition government has recently reached a deal that's set to legalize recreational cannabis use. As a result, German pot stocks popped last week on Frankfurt exchange. For example, German cannabis company Synbiotic rose by 33% to $29 Euro, which implies a $100mm market cap.\n\nWhat the market has forgotten however is that Canadian cannabis LP Tilray is actually the market leader in the Germany's cannabis market. But the stock didn't move last week.\n\nHow do I know the market made a mistake instead of \"everything has been priced in\" narrative?\n\nEasy. First, almost every German pot companies moved up last week. The fact that Tilray didn't change at all suggests that whoever was making market genuinely forgot that Tilray is a market leader in the German cannabis market.\n\nSecond, if we assume status quo on Tilray's 10x EV/Sales multiple, which is a very conservative assumption because we're completely dismissing the potential of a new, 3-days old, 83 million population addressable market. And if we proxy $90 million of additional revenue, which is another very conservative assumption as Tilray generated $90 million in revenue after Canada legalized their adult recreational cannabis market in 2018; Conservative because German population doubles of Canadian. With the conservative multiple assumption while holding other variables constant, just by adding the additional $90 million in revenue, we should expect Tilray trade up by at least 30%. The fact that it didn't trade up at the slightest suggests whoever was making market was sleeping in his office after he had his turkey.\n\nThird, Tilray is production and distribution ready. Tilray operates two state-of-art facilities in Portugal and Germany with over 3 million square feet of production capacity. Tilray also owns and operates one of the largest market cap pharmaceutical company, CC Pharma, in Germany. Because of the company's production and distribution capacity, institutional support, larger balance sheet, domestic moms & pops cannabis producers in Germany aren't like to able to compete against Tilray in the immediate 24 months of legalization, allowing Tilray to secure market leadership. Again, this echoes with why assume only $90 million of revenue and 10x EV/Sales is a very conservative estimate.\n\nForth, there has been consistencies showing that the cannabis MTM is very inefficient. Most of you are aware that there were a squeeze with the Canadian cannabis LPs that took place in February. It was driven by Democrats winning the election, investors bet in favour that recreational cannabis use will be legalized in the U.S. It was similar to what's happening today; similar but different. What's similar is that both are political driven catalyst and market has gotten it completely wrong. Different was that last time Tilray were traded up for the wrong reason, Tilray has minimal operations in the United States, while they're already a market leader in the German cannabis market with operations and infrastructures that are unmatched by their competitors.\n\nThanks for reading, let me know if I got it wrong. Thanks.\n\nPosition: 500 shares long TLRY at C$13.32",
