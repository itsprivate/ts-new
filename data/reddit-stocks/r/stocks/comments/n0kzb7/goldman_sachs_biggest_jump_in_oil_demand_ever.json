A spoiler could be what is going on in India with its Covid surge.   If that is indicative of something other than letting their guard down, like the virus variants are truly more contagious, lethal, and vaccine tolerant, then all bets are off. That will be true of all recovery stocks, though.</p>\n\n<p>If oil has sustained prices for a few months of $80/b then companies like Suncor will be absolutely minting money.  I added more Suncor when it hit $20 last week.  I wish I would have bought more.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I hold SU, RDS.B, a commodities ETF, and smaller positions in a number of other stocks that will be affected by increasing oil prices.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
