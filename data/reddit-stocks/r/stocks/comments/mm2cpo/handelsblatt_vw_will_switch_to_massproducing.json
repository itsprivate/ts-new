The new Hyundai Ioniq 5 is equipped with the technology, and Tesla has commented that all future vehicles will be equipped with bidirectional charging capacity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation of Handelsblatt excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The test vehicles are running, we are in the last pulls with the preparations,” confirms VW Development Board Member Thomas Ulbrich in an interview with the Handelsblatt. From 2022 onwards, <strong>every electric car from the Volkswagen Group that is developed on the basis of the MEB</strong> (“modular electrification kit”) electrical platform can not only charge the electricity but also return it to the grid. In addition to VW, the MEB is also used by the sister brands Audi , Skoda and Seat-Cupra.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Commentary elsewhere:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/\">https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Carmakers that dive into the business of smoothing the grid would benefit more than financially, also. By saving unused renewable energy for future use to feed into the power grid, the vehicle industry would also acquire knowledge of how much storage capacity would actually be available at certain times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For the Volkswagen group, it will also set it apart from Tesla, which is more focused on having its cars on the road in service as autonomous taxis.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
