They invested close to $19 BILLION dollars into research and development last year, and will only to continue investing more as we’ve seen in the years prior.\n\nFirstly, I think it’s important to note that Apple won’t have the first product in any of these markets, and that’s a GOOD thing. When you look back at their history, it doesn’t matter if they’re the first. They’ve never been concerned with rushing products to the market. Their focus, and greatest strength as a company, is in having the best product, which oftentimes is simply a more refined and seamless experience achieved through years of research and fine-tuning.\n\nTake for example, the AirPods. There were plenty of wireless earbuds before AirPods, but for Apple it didn’t matter. They went into a product category that already existed, and, like they’ve always done, created a more seamless, unified, and beautiful design, and ultimately ran away with the lead; In 2020 Apple’s AirPods alone brought in around $23 billion, which was nearly as much as Netflix’s overall revenue ($25 billion), and twice as much as AMD and Spotify’s revenue.\n\nI see this same type of thing that happened with the iPod, iPhone, and AirPods either happening within the space of virtual reality, electric vehicles, healthcare, a combination of these two, or all three.\n\n***Augmented and Virtual Reality:*** A good chunk of that RnD budget is said to be going towards Apple Glasses and AR/VR headsets. [This](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/) article suggests Apple is working an advanced headset that has augmented and virtual reality; with 16 high-quality optical cameras, advanced computational ability, and iris recognition which may be able to identify who you are, specifically, just by looking at your iris. There is nothing like this on the market right now, and paired with Apple’s ability to come out with more seamless and refined products than what’s currently on the market at the time, they could very well create something worthy enough of controlling the market share.\n\nAside from Virtual Reality headsets, there are other ‘secret projects’ that this huge RnD budget can pay for.\n\n***The Apple Car:*** We know it exists. Mainly because in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjuwpcEfkSI) with Elon Musk, Elon laughed at the reporter’s question of if Apple’s even taking the Apple Car seriously. He laughed because, as he said in the interview, it’s an open-secret, and in fact it’s very difficult to hide the over 1,000 engineers Apple hired to work on this project. Especially since he’s in direct competition with Apple to hire electric car engineers and experts to come work at Tesla.\n\n***Healthcare:*** Probably the biggest thing Apple is working on. The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook has repeatedly [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHUz63xFyyw) that he want’s Apple biggest contribution to mankind to be through healthcare. In this piece from the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-struggles-in-push-to-make-healthcare-greatest-legacy-11623832200), it’s revealed how much Apple has really envisioned for its future in healthcare. They’ve said they want to offer health-monitoring subscription-based services through products like the Apple Watch, which there seems to be a lot of demand for right now, and they also want to offer their own primary care services with Apple employed doctors at its own clinics. However the WSJ goes through how difficult the latter part has been for Apple to get this off the ground, saying healthcare is an extremely difficult field to try to do improvements and innovations in. [Haven](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html), the joint-venture formed by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan tried disrupting healthcare in the same way Apple wants to, but they disbanded after 3 years.\n\nNonetheless, any one of these ‘secret projects’ Apple has cooking up in the background could be a massive catalyst for Apple’s growth. Whether it be creating the Apple Glasses or a VR headset, an Apple Car that rivals Tesla, or building hospitals and expanding into healthcare subscription services. But even then, I still hold Apple with the assumption that NONE of these products will be successful. They are a great company with one of the strongest balance sheets in the world, with sales that continue to outpace other leading tech companies year-over-year, despite the same story for the last 15 years being that its simply gotten too big to grow anymore. They’re building up more and more sticky, subscription-based revenue that despite being only around 20% of their yearly revenue, is equal to that of the entire annual revenue of companies like McDonald’s and NVIDIA and it continues to steadily [grow](https://www.statista.com/statistics/382136/quarterly-segments-revenue-of-apple/) year-after-year. And they have an ecosystem of devices that will continue to get bigger, keeping customers locked in and making Apple’s competitors have to work with them, not against them.\n\nIn the case of Apple its not the first product that wins, it’s the superior product that wins, and Apple has been very good at coming out with that superior product. So while some people think Apple’s fully saturated the market or that they have no room left to grow, I think they’re an already growing company with many opportunities to supplement that growth in the future.",
