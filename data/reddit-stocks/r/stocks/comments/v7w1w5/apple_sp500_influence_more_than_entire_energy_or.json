This is even more true in the QQQ, but we all know that because its all tech, in the QQQ, Apple is 13% weighting, ,MSFT is 10%, but apple is weighted as much as GOOGL +AMZN combined in there. so even if GOOGL+AMZN does well, it all just comes down to Apple.\n\nThe flip side work too, like if the entire QQQ sector crash which it did, but AAPL somehow doesnt move, then it just doesnt move. how is that even a fair influence or weighting for the whole market?",
