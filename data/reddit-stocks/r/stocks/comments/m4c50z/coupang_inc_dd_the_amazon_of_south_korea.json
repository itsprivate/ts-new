Would love some <strong>constructive</strong> criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don’t know anything about anything. I&#39;m just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can’t tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I’m just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I’m no expectation. I’m bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn’t a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.</p>\n\n<p>With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coupang Inc DD</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ticker - CPNG</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Initial bullish info (for the apes who can&#39;t stand to read more than 100 words)</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Talked about and known as the “Amazon of South Korea”</li>\n<li>Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba</li>\n<li>Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018</li>\n<li>IPO jumped more than 70%</li>\n<li>Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)</li>\n<li>CEO’s a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)</li>\n<li>Coupang has the highest market share of Korea&#39;s E-commerce business</li>\n<li>Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year</li>\n<li>Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow</li>\n<li>Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea</li>\n<li>Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services</li>\n<li>Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)</li>\n<li>Eco friendly packaging</li>\n<li>Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quantitative:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019</li>\n<li>Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020</li>\n<li>Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019</li>\n<li>Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019</li>\n<li>Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018</p>\n\n<p>2018: -1.5B</p>\n\n<p>2019: -698M</p>\n\n<p>2020: -474M</p>\n\n<p>In November 2018 Softbank&#39;s Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use of Proceeds:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.</li>\n<li>Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.</li>\n<li>Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon&#39;s TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.</p>\n\n<p>📷</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Profitability</strong> (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Opportunity:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Korea&#39;s GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea&#39;s 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.</p>\n\n<p>The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)</p>\n\n<p>Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Management:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bom Suk Kim -</strong> Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.</li>\n<li><strong>Gaurav Anand -</strong> Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?</li>\n<li>**Thuan Pham - (**awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Qualitative:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Same day and Dawn delivery</strong> reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it&#39;s Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.</li>\n<li><strong>Effortless returns</strong> by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Eco-friendly Packaging</strong> cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.</li>\n<li><strong>Employees</strong> work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don&#39;t even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren&#39;t the friendliest” “you&#39;re expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits&#39;&#39; etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Orchestration</strong> meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Services:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rocket WOW Membership</strong> is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and <strong>Rocket Fresh</strong> groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.</li>\n<li><strong>Rocket Delivery</strong> is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.</li>\n<li><strong>Coupang Play</strong> is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell&#39;&#39; to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston&#39;s show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying <em>“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”</em></li>\n<li><strong>Coupang Eats</strong> has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Coupangs customer centricity</strong> continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to <em>“pursue operational excellence and innovation”</em> in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: <em>“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Top Risks:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth</li>\n<li>Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)</li>\n<li><strong>Dilution:</strong> The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TDLR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It&#39;s constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it&#39;s my first ever DD so hopefully it&#39;s not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y&#39;all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there&#39;s anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again, Onions.
