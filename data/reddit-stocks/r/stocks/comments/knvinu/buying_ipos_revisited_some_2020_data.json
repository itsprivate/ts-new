  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Not long ago I posted some results from a study I did of IPOs dating back to 2012 to see whether it made sense to buy IPOs on the IPO day or wait.  I focused on &quot;popular&quot; IPOs to capture the FOMO phenomenon with the highly anticipated IPOs.  The result was clear that it almost always makes sense to wait 6-12 months because in a very high % of cases, the stocks dropped to a price below the opening price at some point, and usually reached the lowest price within the first 6 months.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we&#39;re hitting the end of 2020 I decided to look at some of the IPOs from this year.  I went back and recorded every IPO in June through Sept which takes us back 3-6 months.  I then eliminated a bunch of very thinly traded SPACs that have hardly moved since their IPO.  That left me with a sample of 72 IPOs during that time frame.  Here&#39;s what I found:</p>\n\n<p>Number of stocks that opened trading at a higher price than the IPO price: 60/72 (83.3%)</p>\n\n<p>Number of stocks that subsequently dropped to a price below the opening price: <strong>71/72 (98.6%)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Number of stocks that subsequently dropped to a price below the IPO price: 27/72 (37.5%)</p>\n\n<p>Number of stocks currently trading below the opening trade price: 16/72 (22.2%)</p>\n\n<p>I draw a few interesting conclusions from this data:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Like my other studies, this data confirms the &quot;bowl&quot; pattern that is very common with IPOs: the price opens high, subsequently drops to a lower price, and then generally climbs above the opening price.</li>\n<li>Buying an IPO on the day of the IPO is a huge, huge mistake.  In 98.6% of cases, literally all but one, investors could have gotten a lower price.  In some cases that would have been an intraday low on the IPO day, but in most cases the low came in the days/weeks after the IPO.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t know if this is a phenomenon particular to 2020 without doing the same analysis for previous years, but the data clearly demonstrates the FOMO that occurs around IPOs.  In 83% of cases the stock opened trading at a price higher than the IPO price, which means public demand pushed the price above the price set by the company.  And notice that although the price dropped below the opening trade price in 98.6% of cases, it only dropped below the IPO price in 37.5% of cases.  This would suggest that the actual IPO price is a much more accurate representation of the value of the stock, and any stock that opens trading much higher than the IPO price should be avoided until it drops.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
