Browsing it would make some of you think that the market is down 10%.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re looking at your portfolio and it&#39;s really doing a number on your stomach, <strong>you need to reevaluate your positions</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you took more risk than you wanted to. Maybe you put too much in a risky position. Maybe you bought into the hype. Maybe you thought with your heart and said &quot;[insert company] will never go away so it must go up!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Well, you&#39;re here now. What&#39;s your plan?</p>\n\n<p><strong>COME UP WITH A PLAN</strong></p>\n\n<p>Good investors come up with plans. They don&#39;t sell on red days or green days. They sell when something happens that changes their initial reasons for buying.</p>\n\n<p>Are you going to hold forever? Are you selling before earnings? Are you selling if it gets to whatever price? Are you going to keep buying? </p>\n\n<p>You must have a plan. Once you have this plan...</p>\n\n<p><strong>STICK TO THE PLAN</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do not deviate. Don&#39;t say &quot;maybe it will come back up&quot; or &quot;maybe it will come back down&quot;. Sticking to your plan is crucial. This is how you can manage your risk. It doesn&#39;t matter what happens in the next day or week or year. You did what you thought was the best action to take in the moment because you stuck to your plan. In time, you will tweak your plan to maximize your potential and minimize your downside. Don&#39;t look back at a position and feel great or bad. Just evaluate whether you made the right decision based on the information you were working with at the time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TAKE YOUR EMOTIONS OUT OF THE EQUATION</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do you think Warren Buffett panics every time there&#39;s a red day? Absolutely not. Then why should you? If you let your emotions get the best of you, you WILL do something stupid. The stock market does not care, so why should you?</p>\n\n<p>There are going to be many red days ahead. Are you ready for them?</p>\n\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: a word</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
