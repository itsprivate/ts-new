This is before they became a worldwide symbol of sticking it to the man.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming Cohen can only accomplish at GME what he accomplished at chewy and has no new tricks, he can easily get us to a $14-20 billion market cap with $8-10 billion in future revenue. That yeilds a post-turnaround share price of at least $200.</p>\n\n<p>If we go further than this and assume Cohen can permanently increase GME&#39;s gross margins (digital sales of exclusive games), the sky is the limit. GME <a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-exclusive-gamestop-value-worth/\">already sells</a> exclusive games, so this is not a huge stretch.</p>\n\n<p>For those saying the console makers and game studios don&#39;t want GameStop to thrive: Amazon can simply add games to prime and become a real pain in the ass to all those console makers and game studios. They need GameStop more than you think.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
