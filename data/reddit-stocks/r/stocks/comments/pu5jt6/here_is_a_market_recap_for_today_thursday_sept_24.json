As I have said repeatedly, I remain unconcerned by the tapering of quantitative easing.\n\nMarket participants also eyed developments out of China as the Evergrande saga continues to play out. Concerns that the nation’s second-largest real estate company, which has over $300 billion in debt, will default coming to a head. The company faces $84 million in interest payments to bondholders today, just one of the payments owed in a long string of liabilities coming up that will most likely not be paid. The stock briefly rallied yesterday after agreeing to settle interest payments for an onshore note, though the stock quickly lost the gains as the fate of its offshore debt obligations lies in the balance. \n\nI will make no comment as to how the situation will affect China’s economy or its stock, I am in no way an expert on China or its policies. However, on Monday, I saw comparisons being drawn between this situation and the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers that catalyzed the recession and was asked multiple times if I thought this would lead to some sort of global market crash. My answer, of course, was no. Here is what I wrote on Monday with some slight edits for clarity: \n\n“I think those comparisons are not correct for a few reasons, though please note this is just my humble opinion.\n\n1. For starters, it is almost a certainty the CCP will aggressively intervene in the case of a default given Evergrande is designated as an entity of “systemic importance” in China and President Xi has proven to have no problem wielding a heavy hand when it’s forced. This is China’s “too big to fail moment” and the CCP will likely have to intervene in some way to protect the more than 1.6 million homeowners and bagholders affected\n2. As I said above, the relationship between Chinese and US lenders is limited at best and unlike Lehman Brothers, which existed in the balance sheets of financial institutions worldwide. This means any damage caused within China has is likely to be contained within its own economy. Compared to the US, China’s financial sector remains very insular/regional. \n3. Unlike Lehman Brothers, Evergrande still has tangible assets that will be sold off to help settle financial obligations. While their assets aren’t great and creditors know the company is in trouble, the sale of physical assets will help some. On the other, Lehman Brothers never had hard assets it could sell off, what they had was literally worthless.\n\nSince the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has been absorbing about $120 billion a month in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. Yesterday, Fed officials said that by the end of the year, the economy will have likely hit the “substantial further progress” milestone indicated last December needed for the central bank to begin slowing the pace of those purchases.\n\nThe Fed signaled, “Participants generally view that as long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate”. \n\nHere is the full transcript: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf)\n\nRick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income said,  \"Though markets have been nervously eyeing the start to tapering for months, it is ultimately \"...likely to have minimal market impact at this stage. This is partly because the Fed has done a decent job of telegraphing when tapering is likely to begin (most market participants believe the announcement will come this year),\" Rieder said in a note Wednesday evening. \"But more importantly it’s because the asset purchase reductions are likely to be trivial when seen in the context of how large the fixed income markets are today, and how overwhelming the demand for income has become.\" \n\nIn other news, during remarks following the release of the meeting, Powell promised to make changes to the central bank’s rules on members trading securities. e added that he was not aware of the controversial trades made by Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in 2020 prior to media reports over the past month.\n\n“We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that’s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials,” he said.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n\n* The Biden Administration has submitted a request for information, which is voluntary, from companies affected by the global shortage in semiconductors. The government said the objective is to get more information about supply-side issues and identify ways it could help ease those issues.\n* According to consulting firm AlixPartners, global automakers could lose up to $210 billion in revenue this year due to the chip shortage, double estimates from earlier this year. Really goes to show how supply-side disruption caused by the virtual shutdown of the global economy last year continue to persist",
