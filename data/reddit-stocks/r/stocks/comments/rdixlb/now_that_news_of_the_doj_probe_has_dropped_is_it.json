For a publicly-traded company, this is a  very small amount of shares.\n\nAbout 14 million of these are owned by company insiders.\n\nAbout 6.5 million are in ETFs.\n\nAbout  22 million are owned by institutions (the three largest institutional owners alone — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — own 12.2 million shares).\n\nMillions of other shares are also likely held by non-reporting, non-individual entities, like family funds and small hedge funds.\n\nAll told, this might account for 45-55 million shares, leaving approximately 22-32 million shares in the hands of retail investors.\n\n**As of October 30, and according to GameStop's 10-Q, approximately 500K-700K retail investors from a few small Reddit communities, registering only a portion of their shares,   have locked up 5.2 million $GME shares through direct registration with  GameStop's transfer agent, Computershare LLC.**\n\nBy now (December 10), this number is likely exceeds **10 million shares**,  and perhaps many more, with a wave of shares currently in transit but not yet registered (the process can take as long as 6 weeks).\n\nBear in mind, many foreign investors (and there are a lot) are prevented from direct registering any shares at all, and there are millions of shares in retirement accounts that also can't be registered. And, all this said, there remain many millions of unregistered shares in the cash accounts (as well as the margin accounts) of individuals in these small  Reddit communities, some of whom have decided not to direct register any shares at all.\n\nIn addition to these Reddit investors, there are also many, many other $GME retail investors out there in the world, perhaps millions. Many know nothing of  Reddit or of Computershare/direct registration. They also hold many millions of shares.\n\nIn other words, it's clear as day that retail investors own far more than the official float of GameStop shares. The 5.2 million registered shares documented in GameStop's recent 10-Q makes it abundantly and entirely clear there are millions and millions of fake GME shares in the market.\n\nIt's time for the investing public to wake up.\n\n\\----------\n\n**To punctuate the point made about foreign investors ... eToro, a popular trading app in Europe, has 20 million+ users. eToro users are not allowed to direct register any of their GameStop shares. Furthermore,  it's been shown that more than 4% of eToro users hold GameStop shares.  Even if they hold only an average of 10 shares each (and it's likely higher, in fact), that's at least 8 million GameStop shares. And this is just one of many, many trading apps used throughout the world.**\n\n[**https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/help/1742497142/why-cant-i-use-the-direct-registration-system-drs-to-transfer-my-stocks/**](https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/help/1742497142/why-cant-i-use-the-direct-registration-system-drs-to-transfer-my-stocks/)",
