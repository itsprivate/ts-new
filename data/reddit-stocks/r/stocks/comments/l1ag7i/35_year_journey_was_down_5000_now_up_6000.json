I was proud of myself after going from $5000 to $6000 then I started taking huge risks on penny stocks, adding more money to my account, and soon found myself down huge. I walked away when I was down $5000. I came back a year ago with a new outlook. I recognized I had been making the same mistakes over and over and there were the big lessons I had to learn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>be skeptical of a company you’ve never heard of; stay away completely until doing lots of research.</li>\n<li>hold good-performing stocks for a long time</li>\n<li>gains are gains; it doesn’t have to be sexy. As the adage goes, some of the most boring investments are the best investments.</li>\n<li>read the news (world news, national news, etc.)</li>\n<li>make a plan and stick to it unless you learn information that gives you evidence that your plan is worth changing.</li>\n<li>take advantage of the worst stock market crash ever (LOL)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I’m not an expert, I just wanted to share my story and offer hope to people who are newer investors who are losing lots of money...take a break, refocus, and come back when the time is right for you.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/616Fm5D\">Pics of my 1-year performance and my overall performance</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
