In US equities, industrial stocks, pharmaceuticals, materials and other real economy sectors have had a run of 5 days of gains in a row. Tech/growth stocks may pause in their correction and catch a lift from the consolidation in these other sectors, or they may not. But there has also appeared a new bout of so-called \"dip buying\" that appears to be favoring global assets, including foreign stocks &amp; bonds after analysts cut ratings on \"developed markets\" as the EU &amp; emerging markets have developed into deep value plays since being dragged into the US selloff. \n\nWith that context, \n\n[**Dip Buyers Storm Back to Stocks After Selloff** Investors add about $20 billion to global equity funds in week; Summer rally ‘bandwagon’ is growing, say BofA strategists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-27/stock-funds-see-biggest-inflows-in-10-weeks-as-dip-buyers-return)\n\n&gt; Global equity funds saw their biggest inflows in 10 weeks, led by US stocks, as cheaper valuations lured buyers after a steep selloff on recession fears.\n\n&gt; Investors added about $20 billion to global stocks in the week to May 25, led by inflows into the US, according to Bank of America Corp.’s note citing EPFR Global data.
