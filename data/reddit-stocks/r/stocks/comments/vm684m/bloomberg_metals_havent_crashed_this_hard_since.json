I'll only post the important parts. This post complements the other one on precious metals, with a focus on industrial ones.\n\n&gt; Industrial metals are on track for the worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis as prices are pummeled by recession worries. Copper, the great economic bellwether, has ricocheted into a bear market from a record four months ago, while tin just tumbled 21% in its worst week since a 1980s crisis froze London trading for four years. [...] \n\n&gt; Copper hit a 16-month low of $8,122.50 a ton on the London Metal Exchange on Friday, with an 11% drop so far in June putting it on course for one of the biggest monthly losses of the past 30 years. Metals from aluminum to zinc have also plunged and the Bloomberg Industrial Metals Spot Subindex is down 26% this quarter, headed for the biggest drop since the end of 2008. Tin has more than halved from its March peak. \n\n[Here is a pie chart](https://i.imgur.com/MEB8Z5a.png) of where copper is used. \n\n[Here is a raw metals index](https://i.imgur.com/vXq64Gn.png) compared to gasoline.\n\nChina won't reverse this: \n\n&gt; Chinese manufacturing activity is already shrinking, and S&amp;P Global gauges on Thursday showed European manufacturing output contracting for the first time in two years, while US output hit a 23-month low. Even so, the magnitude of the accelerating selloff in copper and other industrial metals suggests that investors are betting on much steeper declines in demand in the coming weeks.\n\n\nEnergy / agriculture less affected:\n\n&gt; The Bloomberg Energy Spot Subindex is up 10% since the end of March, while a corresponding agriculture index fell 9.7%.\n\nMeasures of 'open-interest' in Chinese copper markets indicate rising short positions: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/8e6u2LX.png).\n\nThis is not because of supply:\n\n&gt; Yet copper and several other metal markets are still facing some of the tightest supply conditions ever. With inventories dwindling globally and little sign of significant new supply, even staunch copper bulls like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. had warned that demand destruction may be necessary to help ease the strain.\n\n**Takeaways**:\n\nInflation will come down fast, and commodities are a very risky trade. Even with supply shortages still present with copper and other metals, the prices are plunging. Once that supply corrects itself, there is even less of a reason to see prices remain where they are.",
