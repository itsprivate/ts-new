Id be happy to buy discounted shares however. \n\nAlbertsons: ACI\n\nfinancials seem terrible, no room for real growth with pretty robust competition. Avoid.\n\nModivcare Inc: MODV\n\nStock price running real hot and enjoying a covid high, will probably correct hard. Medical transportation and logistics has been huge with covid but will soon be back to normal and they cant maintain the growth, with a PE of 66 im scared plus so much revenue is based on government contracts  I'm avoiding.\n\nWalMart: WMT\n\nNot going to outperform, never going away. Would buy at discount, wont buy open market.\n\nDick's:  DKS\n\ntheir financials seem really good. I dont know how but they are crushing it. The ones local to me dont seem to do much business. But revenue, profits, doing great. Buying back shares to increase stock value and even paying a dividend for icing on the cake. Im contemplating buying some open market after some more DD as this one confuses me and will jump on a discounted share in a heartbeat, which almost pains me to say since that was my least favorite place to work ever.\n\nMy current employer is the federal government so their stock is pretty much a bond and those arte pretty lame. Where have you worked you would hold stock in? Do you currently work somewhere where you would be confortable buying stock in the company?",
