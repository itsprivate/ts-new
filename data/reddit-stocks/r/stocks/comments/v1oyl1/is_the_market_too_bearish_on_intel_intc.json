However they have a new CEO with an engineering background who to me seems to be taking the company in the right direction over the long term.

Intel Alder lake is very competitive with AMD's latest offerings and Intel Arc could eventually capture a large part of the GPU market.\n\nThe market cap of Intel is currently \\~182 billion, with a P/E Ratio of 7.41, and a dividend yield of 3.28%. The stock has been relatively flat since 2018.\n\nBy comparison, TSMC who only fabs chips has a market cap of \\~468 billion, a P/E ratio of 20.59 and a dividend yield of 1.62.\n\nAMD which designs chips but owns no fabs has a market cap of \\~165 billion, a P/E Ratio of 38.14, and no dividend.\n\nIntel has both fabs and designs their own chips yet is only valued slightly higher than AMD? Intel has the dominant market share in Servers, Desktop, and Mobile (laptop) processors, although AMD has been gaining ground. Intel will soon be competing directly with TSMC by fabricating third party chips in Intel's fabs. My question, does the market's bearish sentiment on Intel make any sense? Provided Intel doesn't delay their roadmaps I am finding it very difficult to believe that Intel should be valued at only 182 billion.\n\nThank you for your insights ahead of time!",
