Lucid went public via a different method that does not require vetting by any investment bank and this method is only used by less respected companies (I'd use the word for the method but it is banned by automods in this sub and using it would make this post disappear).  Companies using this method can say anything they want during the pre-merger period, and as a consequence they frequently miss their projections by a large margin as Lucid has done in recent weeks\n\n\\- During its most recent earnings call, Rivian kept its future vehicle production guidance the same for the remainder of this year. During its most recent earnings call, Lucid reduced its vehicle production guidance for the remainder of this year by 50%!\n\n\\- Rivian has Amazon as its customer;\n\n\\- Rivian has a 2.5x greater vehicle backlog in units versus Lucid, with an initial deposit requirement 6x as as high relative the vehicle invoice price.  Lucid's deposit for a $160,000 reservation is only $300!   Not much commitment required on the customer's part to reserve a car.  Almost throw away money.\n\n\\- I have seen 30+ Rivian trucks on the road here in Sonoma County. I have never seen a Lucid Air on the road.  Ever.\n\nThe Lucid Group has roughly the same valuation in terms enterprise value as Rivian.\n\nPlease explain or upvote if you think Rivian should have a higher enterprise value.",
