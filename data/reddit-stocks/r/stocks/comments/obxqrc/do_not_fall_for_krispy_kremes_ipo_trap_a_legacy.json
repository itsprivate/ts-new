A company riddled with a history of fraud, misleading investors, and deceitful accounting tactics is being dumped to the public by a large private equity firm.\n\nMy god, this is one of the most blatant cash outs I’ve ever seen. CNBC was pumping this name all morning and interviewed their CEO who touted its new “omni-channel” strategy that will lead to better margins. My BS meter started going off so I decided to read their S-1 and see what was going on under the hood.\n\nKrispy Kreme used to be public in the 2000’s and was acquired by JAB Holdings in 2016 for $1.35 billion following numerous scandals of channel stuffing and overstating revenues. Execs would pretty much order shipments of donuts to be sent to franchises and claim sales to meet quarterly estimates. Wild. There are other irregular accounting techniques used throughout the years along with bullying tactics used against franchise owners but you get the picture, won’t go into detail.\n\nSo now after a few years of being private sprinkled with an acquisition (Insomnia Cookies), execs/JAB decided it was time to cash out.\n\nIn the presentation, Krispy Kreme emphasizes its strong revenue growth. This is a trap. Their organic growth is flat +1% at most when you strip out revenues from their debt heavy acquisition which is why their margins are just awful now and will not improve. It also excludes new shops that were recently opened because it does not matter if you are growing as a company if you can’t achieve economies of scale. You see this a lot with companies who know they can’t be profitable - emphasize revenue growth! \n\nKrispy Kreme shouldn’t trade at more than 1x its revenue until it proves it can be profitable through some miraculous turnaround. At a $3 billion market cap currently, I forecast it is nearly 40% overvalued. This should be a $10 stock. Whoever the lead underwriter was for this IPO deserves a raise after pulling such a ridiculous multiple. I guess that’s why companies go public when the market is at all-time highs.",
