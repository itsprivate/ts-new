The vast majority believe that if so, it will be a stock split announcement. I believe it will be a merger. Or it could be both. You can read about the clues [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/550702/tesla-12-9-stock-split/amp/). Considering the amount and timeline of hints, I believe it would be bigger than a split. \n\nDecember of last year Musk replied to a tweet saying it would be a “good idea” to merge all 4 companies into a holding company called “X” with a business plan/description of “ensure human survival and progress”. The name of “X” would be in tribute to the first company he started, which became PayPal. With this, combining all the companies would give musk more time for other business ventures, as he’s stated he wants to get into planes as well but doesn’t currently have the time to. Around 4-5 years ago musk entertained the idea in an interview. [source here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-combining-spacex-tesla-boring-a-good-idea-2020-12%3famp)\n\nPreviously, when Tesla wasn’t doing as well, musk said that a merger with SpaceX was possible to prop up Tesla. With the recent announcement that SpaceX could go bankrupt, it seems like the reverse would happen. \n\nAnother speculative hint I came up with this is that X is the Roman numerical of 10. If a merger was announced on the 9th and implemented on the 10th. \n\n**Of course, it’s all just speculation but those are my thoughts. I am also not currently invested in Tesla at the time of this post for those wondering my intentions on this. Not financial advice**\n\nEdit: something else I thought of which is odd is Musk selling 10% of his shares now to pay taxes on his contracts which don’t expire until next year. This may be to screw over the penny pinchers/day traders into selling and also shorts before he makes a big announcement as he has a strong dislike towards them.",
