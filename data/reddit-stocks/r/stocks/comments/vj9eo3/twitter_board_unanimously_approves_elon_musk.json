Notably, the company’s market cap has dropped below $30 billion. So a $44 billion deal is really beneficial for all existing shareholders.\n\n&gt;The deal is still hanging in balance over the issue of the number of bots on the platform. Earlier this month, Twitter gave Musk access to its full “firehose” — a stream of Tweets without any restriction — to check for the percentage of bots on the social network.\n\n&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk said that there are still “unresolved matters” over the deal.\n\n&gt;“There is the question of, will the debt portion of the round come together and then will the shareholders vote in favor,” he noted.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2022/06/21/twitter-asks-shareholders-to-approve-the-44-billion-elon-musk-takeover/",
