  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 27, 2021**\n\nStocks declined following a record-setting session yesterday as concerns over the coronavirus delta came to a head, with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reversing their indoor mask policy, recommending that fully vaccinated people begin wearing masks indoors again in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, “In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools”. As I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. In my humble opinion, as it usually does, the market is overreacting to the news, personally I remain bullish moving forward, though one always has to acknowledge the risks present in the market.\n\nIn other news, Chinese stocks kept plummeting as the regulatory crackdown by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intensified. For context, Alibaba (BABA) is down 10% this week, roughly 50% from its previous all-time high and is trading at roughly the same price as in March 2020. In the US, eyes are on earnings, with mega-caps Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Apple (AAPL) all reporting. Chip-maker AMD is also reporting. Combined, these companies have a market cap greater than $6.5 trillion.\n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 51,939 on July 25, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. \n\nHowever, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nDavid Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “We \\[Goldman Sachs\\] think the Delta variant should pose a minimal risk to the US equity market. From an economic perspective, widespread vaccinations and strategies focused on containment suggest limited medical and economic downside even if infections continue to rise. From a flows perspective, robust household cash balances and corporate buyback authorizations should continue to support inflows for equities, increasing the likelihood that market participants perceive a pullback as a buying opportunity”. I agree, given the transmission is largely concentrated in certain areas, I do not expect the re-introduction of lockdown measures that could hamper the current pace of recovery. Of course, that's just my opinion.\n\nNow onto earnings, Microsoft beat earnings estimates but it seems market participants were hoping for a larger beat of the estimates, with the stock falling 3% after-hours. Here are the numbers. \n\n* **Revenue:** $46.15 billion versus $44.25 billion expected\n* **Earnings per share:** $2.17 versus $1.92 expected\n* **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.69 billion versus $13.9 billion expected\n* **Intelligent Cloud:** $17.38 billion versus $16.4 billion expected\n* **More Personal Computing:** $14.09 billion versus $13.8 billion expected\n\nImportantly, Microsoft saw revenues from Azure, its cloud computing platform, rise 51% year-on-year. In total, revenues were up 21% compared to the same quarter last year, great growth for the second largest publicly traded company. \n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) smashed earnings estimates and the stock jumped roughly 2.5% before cooling down somewhat. Here are the numbers\n\n* **Earnings per share (EPS):** $27.26 vs $19.34 per share\n* **Revenue:** $61.88 billion vs $56.16 billion\n* **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.00 billion vs $6.37 billion expected\n* **Google Cloud revenue:** $4.63 billion vs $4.40 billion expected, \n* **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $10.93 billion vs $9.74 billion expected\n\nImportantly, Alphabet saw Google ad revenue ballooned to $50.44 billion, a roughly 69% increase year-on-year. Just to put into context how massive Alphabet is, revenue from Youtube was $7 billion, an 83% increase year-on-year and roughly the entire revenue of Netflix ($7.34 billion). \n\nApple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, absolutely demolished earnings with some of the most impressive earnings beats I’ve seen. The stock reaction is largely muted. Here are the numbers\n\n* **EPS**: $1.30 vs. $1.01 estimated \n* **Revenue**: $81.41 billion vs. $73.30 billion estimated, up 36% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue**: $39.57 billion vs. $34.01 billion estimated, up 49.78% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue**: $17.48 billion vs. $16.33 billion estimated, up 33% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue**: $8.76 billion vs. $7.80 billion estimated, up 40% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue**:$8.24 billion vs. $8.07 billion estimated, up 16% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue**: $7.37 billion vs. $7.15 billion estimated, up 12% year-over-year \n* **Gross margin**: 43.3% vs. 41.9% estimated \n\nApple also had a strong quarter in its Greater China region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong in addition to the mainland. Apple reported $14.76 billion in sales in the region, up 58% year-on-year/. Sales in America were up nearly 33% year-over-year to $39.57 billion. \n\nIn other news, later this week, investors will hear from Federal Reserve officials over the path forward for monetary policy, which will likely be informed by the increased concerns over the Delta variant and peaking economic growth rates. Analysts are predicting that the downside risks still present in the economy will continue to overshadow potential worries over inflation, which means members of the Fed are very unlikely to make any changes in the upcoming meeting. What I am most interested in from these meetings is hearing about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing (QE). I expect the Fed will make some kind of announcement regarding this before the year ends. The real test for equities is coming in 2023, when the interest rate is expected to begin rising.\n\n\"Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.\" - Winston Churchill",
