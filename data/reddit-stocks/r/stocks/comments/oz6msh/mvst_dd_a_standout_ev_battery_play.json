Not financial advice.*\n\n**The Company**\n\nFounded in 2006, Microvast is an American leader in the development and manufacturing of Lithium-ion batteries for EVs and energy storage applications. They are headquartered in Texas, United States. The company is vertically integrated with the ability to manufacture their own battery components, cells, modules and packs. They currently have over 1200 employees globally and over 550 patents on their array of battery chemistries.\n\nMicrovast recently went public via reverse merger on July 21st, 2021 with Tuscan Holdings Corp. Unlike many other recent companies in the industry, Microvast already has real products, manufacturing and revenue. Microvast batteries have already powered more than 30,000 electric vehicles that have traveled over 3 billion miles in countries around the world. They specifically focus on powering industrial and commercial vehicles like buses and trucks.\n\nMicrovast products include a range of different battery chemistries including HpTO, MpCO, HpCO, HnCO and MpFO batteries. These cells and modules allow Microvast to provide products for a variety of markets offering competitive price points, best in class charging speeds and an impressive life cycle. Their current batteries have an ultra long life cycle of 2500-8000+ charges and have had zero safety incidents.\n\nIn terms of finances, Microvast raised over $800 Million by going public at a valuation of $3 Billion at $10 per share. In a recent interview, COO Shane Smith explained that Microvast has won more business than they currently have a capacity for and will use the capital raised to scale up manufacturing to meet demand. Microvast reported a revenue of $107 Million for last year 2020. They project a revenue of $230 million for this year 2021 and expect to grow at a CAGR of 55% from 2020 to 2025. They project a revenue of over $2.3 billion by 2025 making valuation at $10 less than than 1.5x projected 2025 sales. Microvast's current customers include Dana, ZF, Porsche Motorsport, Gaussin and Oshkosh. Oshkosh also notably invested $25 million into the Microvast PIPE.\n\n**What’s Next for MVST?**\n\nTheir expansion into the United States with their new plant in Clarksville, Tennessee caused speculation when they also announced their partnership with an investment from Oshkosh around the same time. This caused Microvast shares to spike to over $20 when Oshkosh announced they won the $6 Billion contract for next gen USPS vehicles. It is still unclear how many of the estimated 165,000 vehicles will be EVs or contain Microvast batteries. Regardless, if confirmed, this would be massive news for Microvast's growth into the US market.\n\nEarlier this year, Microvast announced they were in talks with two still unnamed “marquee” customers for contracts worth billions of dollars. It is unknown if Oshkosh would be considered one of the two since they have not announced any official contracts. Other rumors include Daimler/Mercedes due to their new electric trucks and close proximity to Microvast’s Germany plant but this is only speculation at this point.\n\nFinally, Microvast has a large R&D division of over 500 employees working on future products. They aim to find ways to increase energy density, charging speed etc. Earlier this year, Microvast confirmed that they are working on several key technologies including Solid-State batteries. While their progress on Solid-State is currently unknown, just look at Quantumscape's current $9 Billion valuation to see how massive an announcement on Solid-State would be.\n\nThe Electric Vehicle revolution is here and the demand for battery manufacturing and technology seems almost certain to rapidly increase. Microvast presents a very promising EV battery play at an attractive valuation. They are years ahead of other emerging battery companies as they already have real manufacturing, products and revenue. While the company is still clearly scaling up to meet demand, Microvast has the potential for several huge announcements in the future.",
