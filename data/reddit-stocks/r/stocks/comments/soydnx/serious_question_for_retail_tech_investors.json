And they are okay buying those growth stocks at very high valuations. But as a blue collar guy I have never bought heavily into any of those tech stocks with what I thought were nose bleed valuations. And I've always bought stocks that I can understand.

And I am not against tech as I am fine buying &amp; holding stocks like Intel that are used in everything that have cheap valuations.\n\nBut my question is, do we all have bias based on the bubble we live in?
