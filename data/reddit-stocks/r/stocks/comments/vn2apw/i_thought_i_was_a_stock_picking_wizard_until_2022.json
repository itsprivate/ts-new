Well, I shifted a good chunk of portfolio into GOOGL/AMZN from growth last year, about 20% allocation, but that didn't help much. Biotech in particular has been in BRUTAL bear marker ever.

If you bought something on borrowed conviction, then most likely you are shaken out by this time. \n\nHang in there folks, better times will come, unless of course you bought oversized position in Teladoc or Carvana on top 😬\nBear markets are unavoidable. We just need to be mentally prepared for those. Macro bros / FCF \"experts\" / perma bears think we are going way lower. The thing is that *nobody* knows. I continue DCAing at this point. I won't catch a bottom and I don't need to honestly. Also all sectors do NOT decline equally as well. If SPY corrects other 20% from here that does not necessarily mean that XBI for instance will follow. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk. \n\nTop 3 holdings: GOOGL, NET, AMZN (praying for the rest).\n\nEDIT: it's pretty amazing how I'm getting blamed in the comments for giving people \"advices\" 🙄Are you kidding me?
