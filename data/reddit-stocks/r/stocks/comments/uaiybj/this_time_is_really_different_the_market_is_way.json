The Wall Street traders are selling everything, but they will not stay in cash very long with Inflation not peaking.  I will be buying more shares of $INTC, $HAL, $MOS, $T, and $GOLD Monday.  I am betting that dividend stocks &amp; commodity stocks will outperform Us Bonds and Cash with 8% inflation.  I am also betting that Wall Street will be buying back in this week. Because TINA still applies until the US 10 year gets closer to 6% and gets within 2% plus/minus current inflation. \n\n Good Luck Everyone.",
