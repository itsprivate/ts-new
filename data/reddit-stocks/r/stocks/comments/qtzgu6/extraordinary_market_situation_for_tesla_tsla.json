We know exactly how much he sells each day since he needs to file those numbers to the SEC. You can find them here: [click](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings)\n\nThis is the proof he is really selling as announced.\n\nYou may check this article to see its legit:\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389)\n\n# How it is going:\n\nI found this graphic on Twitter which visualizes his sales in relation to the performance of the Tesla share price: [here](https://twitter.com/RawBooty2/status/1459121681549733893)\n\nThis shows that Elons sales continously move the price downwards. Please note that the graphic wasnt updated for fridays sales yet. I will update it as soon as its available.\n\n# Now the interesting part We know how many shares he still has to sell !\n\nIt is 17,3m shares (10% of 172,6m) minus what has been sold already.\n\n**So that is 11,4m shares left for sale** since we know from SEC files he sold 4,9m shares until friday.\n\nI copied all the SEC files in one Excel document and calculated the sales volumes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we assume he will continue to sell 500 - 639k shares a day as he did the last three days that means **he will be selling for another 18-23 trading days**. Which would be 8th dec - 15th dec\n\nSo how do we use this knowledge ?\n\nWell I assume and the chart proves it that the buyers will not be willing to jump in front of the bus while Elon dumps his shares. So there is a really good chance we see lower prices until he is done.\n\nUnfortunately i cant include pictures in this post. I will give you guys a link to a post with pictures in the comments.\n\nThere was a rise in SP on Wednesday but he filed his first SEC report on Wednesday evening.\n\nSo ever since it is public knowledge that he **really** started selling and how much he sells it was going down.\n\n# How to play it:\n\nI see several possibilities to take profit from this knowledge\n\n1. Hold puts until Elon is almost done\n2. Sell a part of holding now and buy it back later at lower prices (some say thats what EMusk might intend to do)\n3. Hold puts until Elon is done and reinvest your gains in calls\n4. Look at the daily patterns, caused by Elons broker dumping shares\n\nAgain, i cant post pictures here. I will include the link to the pictured post in the comments.\n\nYou might notice that each day from Wednesday to Friday starts with a dip and then a mini rally which peaks between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM. Followed by descending prices through the day.\n\nCurrently i am holding puts which i bought last monday and wednesday.\n\nI am no financial advisor and please dont regard this as any form of advice or recommendation.\n\nPlease do your own due dilligence!",
