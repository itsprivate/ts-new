These practices have been around for decades and  have  resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American  public  by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been  put  out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this   problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short   sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants;   the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust   Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of   the small American investor continues unabated.</p>\n\n<p>Why  is This Important? This problem affects  the investing public. Whether  invested directly in the stock market or  in mutual funds, IRAs,  retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it  touches the majority  of Americans.</p>\n\n<p>The participants in  this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make  Enron look like  child&#39;s play, have been very successful in maintaining a  veil of  secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have  unknowingly (?)  helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely  knows when its  pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock  price get chalked  up to “market forces” when they are often market  manipulations.</p>\n\n<p>The  stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who   went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business   brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market   and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is   estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into   bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short   sellers.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to  understand that selling a stock short is not an  investment in American  enterprise. A short seller makes money when the  stock price goes down  and that money comes solely from investors who  have purchased the  company&#39;s stock. A successful short manipulation  takes money from  investment in American enterprise and diverts it to  feed Wall Street&#39;s  insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is  worse off and the  investing public has lost money. Frequently this  profit is diverted to  off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This  national disgrace is a  parasite on the greatest capital market in the  world.</p>\n\n<p>A  Glossary of Illogical Terms — The securities  industry has its own  jargon, laws and practices that may require  explaining. Most of these  concepts are the creation of the industry,  and, while they are promoted  as practices that ensure an orderly market,  they are also exploited as  manipulative tools. This glossary is limited  to naked short abuse, or  counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly  referred to.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Broker Dealer or Prime Broker</strong>  — The big stockbrokers who  clear their own transactions, which is to  say they move transacted  shares between their customers directly, or  with the DTC. Small brokers  will clear through a clearing house — also  known as a broker&#39;s broker.</li>\n<li><strong>Hedge Funds</strong>  — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment  pools for rich  investors. They have grown exponentially in the past  decade and now  number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars.  They don&#39;t  register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and  frequently foreign  domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers  with access to all  of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they  operate secretively  and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the  hedge funds and  allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually  in fees and  charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.</li>\n<li><strong>Market Maker</strong>  — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who  makes a market in a stock.  In order to be a market maker, they must  always have shares available  to buy and sell. Market makers get certain  sweeping exemptions from SEC  rules involving naked shorting.</li>\n<li><strong>Short Seller</strong>  — An individual, hedge fund, broker or  institution who sells stock  short. The group of short sellers is  referred to as “the shorts.”</li>\n<li><strong>The Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>  — The SEC is the  federal enforcement agency that oversees the  securities markets. The  top–level management is a five–person Board of  Governors who are  Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are  usually from the  securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC  adopted Regulation  SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked  short abuse.</li>\n<li><strong>Depository Trust Clearing Corp</strong>  — Usually known as the DTCC,  this privately held company is owned by  the prime brokers and it clears,  transacts and holds most stock in this  country. It has four  subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS.  The operation of this  company is described in detail later.</li>\n<li><strong>Short Sale</strong>  — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit  while the stock  price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to  sell short, he  borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S  immediately  sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has  the cash  from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the  share  from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes  some of  the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”,  which  he returns to investor L&#39;s account. Investor S books a profit and   investor L has his share back. This relatively simple process is  perfectly legal—so far. The  investor lending the share most likely  doesn&#39;t even know the share left  his account, since it is all  electronic and occurs at the prime broker  or DTC level. If shares are  in a margin account, they may be loaned to a  short without the consent  or knowledge of the account owner. If the  shares are in a cash account,  IRA account or are restricted shares they  are not supposed to be  borrowed unless there is express consent by the  account owner.</li>\n<li><strong>Disclosed Short</strong>  — When the share has been borrowed or a  suitable share has been  located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed  short. Shorts are  either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some  disclosed shorts are  really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock  borrowing.</li>\n<li><strong>Naked Short</strong>  — This is an invention of the securities industry  that is a license to  create counterfeit shares. In the context of this  document, a share  created that has the effect of increasing the number  of shares that are  in the market place beyond the number issued by the  company, is  considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion,  since some  shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today&#39;s  rules. The  alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an  orderly and  smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a  virtually  unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to  widespread stock  manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud.   Returning to our  example, everything is the same except the part about  borrowing the  share from someone else&#39;s account: There is no borrowed  share — instead  a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the  DTC. Without a  borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is  really a  counterfeit share.</li>\n<li><strong>Fails–to–Deliver</strong>  — The process of creating shares via naked  shorting creates an obvious  imbalance in the market as the sell side is  artificially increased  with naked short shares or more accurately,  counterfeit shares. Time  limits are imposed that dictate how long the  sold share can be naked.  For a stock market investor or trader, that  time limit is three days.  According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer  has not located a share to  borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the  short account and  purchase a share in the open market. This is called a  “buy–in,” and it  is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in  the market place  equal to the number of shares the company has issued.  Market makers  have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed  to carry a  naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they  have to  borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted  time and  a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short  becomes a  fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).</li>\n<li><strong>Options</strong>  — The stock market also has separate, but related  markets that sell  options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to  sell shares (a  “put”). Options are an integral part of short  manipulations, the result  of SEC promulgated loopholes in Reg SHO. A  call works as follows:  Assume investor L has a share in his account that  is worth $25. He may  sell an option to purchase that share to a third  party. That option  will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a  specific future  date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this  option. If at the  expiration date, the market value of the stock is  below $30 (the  “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and  investor L keeps  the option payment. This is called “out of the money.”  If the market  value of the stock is above the strike price, then the  buyer of the  option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to  $40. The option  buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of  the share,  which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.</li>\n<li><strong>Naked call</strong>  — The same as above except that investor L, who  sells the call, has no  shares in his account. In other words, he is  selling an option on  something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC  rules also allow  the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a  naked call as a  borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off  the SEC&#39;s  fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call  as its  borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold,  even  though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The story continues <a href=\"http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html\">HERE</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
