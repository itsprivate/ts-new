I first invested in it at $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.</p>\n\n<p>They have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. <a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/\">Stockinvest.us</a> has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it hit $150 next week. I tend to be a bit bullish on TSM and I see this chip shortage being the catalyst that can give us a strong first quarter. With the chip shortage being fueled by the high demand in the auto industry among all the new smart technology devices.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe investing in TSM or into any position for just 1 reason or even for somebody else&#39;s reasons is wise. It&#39;s easy to pull up the graph and see the upward trend but I am trying to focus on need for TSM products and the ways they plan on increasing production.</p>\n\n<p>How and if you choose to invest in TSM is up to you. I am long TSM and I am interested in the following as well.</p>\n\n<p>ON,MU,ASML,AMAT,LRCX</p>\n\n<p>I hope this was helpful to someone. I think it would be a good idea to at least give it a second look for those looking for Semiconductor exposure.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
