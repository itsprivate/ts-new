Basically, someone said they started buying stocks six months ago and have been in the red since until finally breaking even this week. As a beginner, it’s so difficult, because you’re excited and you understand the market returns 7-10% per year vs. nothing as cash. So six months later, when your carefully selected stocks stink, it feels bad, man.\n\nI am here to tell you to HOLD your ridiculous stock, and to wrap your head around the idea that a LOT of people have been at this for a very long time. Your stocks are doing badly because people years before you thought the same thing you did: this is a great company! And they doubled, tripled, whatevered their money, and are now selling. This results in you having an unrealized loss or reduced unrealized gain that only becomes real IF YOU SELL. But you don’t have to realize it. Because you haven’t lost money. Your stock has simply lost its SHORT-TERM momentum. \n\nOne of my recent stinkers has been TSM which I bought at the literal top in February. There are lots of stocks like this in tech, renewables, anything ARK. Same with crypto. And all for the same reason – people are cashing out! An analogy would be sitting at a slot machine right after somebody else just hit the jackpot. Bummer in the short term, but it’s still a good machine! Back to TSM, here’s a scenario: Imagine someone buys at the literal top in January 2018 @ $46. Then the stock drops and is stuck below that for 20 months straight until October 2019 when it finally breaks above $46. From there, it hangs out around the low 50s for several months until July 2020 when it nearly TRIPLES in value peaking above $140 in Feb 21. Sure, the pattern mimics what happened in the broader market, but that’s the point. A TSM holder would be up over 250% today. That's sure better than 7-10%.\n\nRight now, my human emotion is thinking “boo-hoo, I am still down now while others are doing well.” But that’s not what matters. For most people, buying individual stocks isn’t a game of making a quick buck. It’s a game of being capable, consciously and financially, to wait it out – sometime for years – for these kinds of gains. This concept was never explained to me, but I think it’s an important lesson for beginners so they don’t sell a good thing and get taken advantage of when they miss the rocket emoji.",
