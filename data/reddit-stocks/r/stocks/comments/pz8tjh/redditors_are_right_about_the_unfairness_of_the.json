Recent events suggest their suspicion that the decks are stacked against them is justified – which is a terrible look for capitalism.\n\nDaniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School, has amassed evidence of widespread insider trading by company executives, Bloomberg Businessweek reported this week. An investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that more than 130 U.S. federal judges failed to recuse themselves from 685 court cases involving companies in which they or their families had investments. And at the Federal Reserve, two policymakers have resigned amid a probe into their personal trading activity.  \n\nWharton professor Taylor’s research has shown that corporate insiders consistently dumped holdings before official legal probes hurt their company’s shares, Businessweek reported. They also increased their buying and selling in the gaps between audit reports being produced for company boards and being made publicly available, and exploited rules governing scheduled trading schedules for profit.\n\nHis analysis suggests the existing regulations governing insider trading are inadequate. It also implies that the Securities and Exchange Commission is asleep at the wheel: The watchdog instigated only 33 insider trading cases last year and just 32 in 2019, the fewest in more than two decades, according to Businessweek.\n\nSince 1974, federal law has explicitly prohibited U.S. judges from overseeing cases in which they or their immediate family have a “legal or equitable interest, however small,” the Journal reported earlier this week. But the newspaper found that in two-thirds of the cases in which judiciary members had a stake, the rulings would have benefited their finances.  \n\nAt the U.S. central bank, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan both resigned within hours of each other on Monday. Both had revealed questionable investing activity in their annual financial disclosures. And while they said the trades were within the central bank’s rules, both are being scrutinized further. “We’re looking carefully at the trading that was done to make sure that it’s in compliance with our rules and with the law,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nIn light of those embarrassing events in the U.S., you’d hope that every central bank in the world is currently getting busy reviewing the protocols governing what policy makers are allowed to do with their personal portfolios while in office. You’d also hope that every central banker in the world is examining their investment activities and tappity-tapping a resignation letter if their pursuit of personal profit is at odds with the probity of their position.\n\nCapitalism is still tarnished by the aftershocks of the global financial crisis, when the risks taken by private capital had to be bailed out by public funds. And the growing prevalence of the fastest-growing companies staying off public markets and funding their expansion instead with private capital keeps them out of the portfolios of retail buyers, further stoking suspicion that the covenant between capitalism and society is asymmetrical and biased against individual investors.\n\nWhen corporate executives, judges and policy makers line their own pockets by either bending or breaking rules designed to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, they do a disservice to society as a whole. “Most Americans today believe the stock market is rigged, and they’re right,” Wharton’s Taylor told Businessweek.\n\nSure, public officials have the same right to set aside income for their retirement or to pay school fees or even to buy sport cars or boats. But they can achieve those goals by putting their money into blind trusts or index funds or other financial products that don’t involve them selecting specific individual stocks of companies.
