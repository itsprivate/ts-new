That has been resolved now and people are grabbing profits and piling up cash.\n\nSo once this correction is finished what are they gonna do? Put their money in 10-year treasuries at less than 2% a pop? Come on. They’re gonna buy back into the market. There’s still no alternative. Cash will erode to inflation.\n\nIf we accept the notion that inflation wasn’t transitory after all and will keep on going, then where are you gonna place your money? Gold? You want to be in the stock market, because the fed would have to raise rates by 5% to hit their 2% inflation target assuming 7% consistent YOY inflation as a new norm. They can’t raise rates by that much without bankrupting the US, crashing the housing market etc etc.\n\nThey *might* raise them by 0.75%. That’s not going to make a dent in inflation. It does not behoove the government to fight inflation with their current enormous debt. Taxation through inflation is clearly the plan, and the most sensible way out.\n\nSo here we are selling off to get into cash because things are overvalued. Overvalued? Some assets absolutely, but true inflation was well over 15% last year. The SP500 rose high 20%s, a lot thanks to the mega caps who by the way haven’t really caught up to inflation with their prices yet, but are making money hand over fist.\nEither way if 15% of those 28% gains were inflation/money expansion, and we already dipped 10%, that leaves another 5% on the table.\n\nI think the sell off will overshoot by 5-10% and then rebound. In other words I’d expect another 10% drop before we go back up, albeit at a slower pace as the tapering begins and rates increase.\n\nThe economy is in good shape. Low employment numbers, end of the pandemic, wages increasing. A new era of tech / AR coming.",
