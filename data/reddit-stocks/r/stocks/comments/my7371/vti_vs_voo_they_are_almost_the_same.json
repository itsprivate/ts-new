However both these indices are market weighted. Which means that the larger the company the more allocation it has in the index. Because of that, and because how giant S&amp;P 500 companies are in comparison to the other 3,000 smaller companies, 95% of VTI is S&amp;P 500. So 95% of VTI is VOO.  Check out their historical performance - very close. I wish I could paste a graph here. </p>\n\n<p>So their performance is almost identical. VOO has a slightly higher dividend yield. Fee is the same - 3bps. </p>\n\n<p>Funny thing is that although VTI is more diversified, it has slightly higher historical volatility.</p>\n\n<p>At the end - either fund is fine. However if you truly want to have non-S&amp;P exposure, you should add VXF (or maybe VO) as a complement to VOO. </p>\n\n<p>Also, VTI is total US market. No international exposure. So VXUS might be a good companion as well if you want some outside of US exposure.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
