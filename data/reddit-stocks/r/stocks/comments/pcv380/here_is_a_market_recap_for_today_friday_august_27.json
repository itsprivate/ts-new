  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 27, 2021**\n\nStocks shook off yesterday’s jitteriness and powered higher, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recording fresh intraday highs while the treasury yield fell as market participants considered a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, vastly outperformed on the day, rising roughly 3% at the time of writing. The Dow Jones (DIA) remains slightly below record-levels. \n\nToday, Powell gave his annual Jackson Hole speech, which provided a fuller picture on what his thinking is regarding the pace of economic recovery and inflation in light of the recent threats by the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant. Despite some comments by more hawkish Fed members that favor tapering the pace of quantitative easing (QE) sooner-rather-than-later, Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, “At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions.”\n\nPowell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would “arrive after the need has passed” and “could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, “The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.”\n\nRegarding inflation, Powell once again reiterated his view that current inflationary pressures are transitory and broadly due to pandemic-induced factors but suggested he was prepared to act if incoming data deems it appropriate. He said, “Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time. At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply–demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic. We also expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant's effects.”\n\nHere is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It’s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy maker thinks of the current state of the economy\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Suppport.com (SPRT) have been on absolute fire recently, with the stock opening 100% up today.

This is getting short-squeezed hard\n* ESPN, which is owned by Disney (DIS), is reportedly seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billions over several years, according to sources familiar with the matter as reported by the Wall Street Journal. On offer is the right for a suitor to use the ESPN name for branding purposes and potentially rename its sportsbook after ESPN. The sports-media giant has held talks with players that own major sportsbooks, including casino operator Caesars Entertainment (CZR)[ ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CZR?mod=chiclets)and DraftKings (DKNG) the sources said. ESPN has existing marketing partnerships with both companies already. This is huge for the sports-betting industry, will be closely following this story.\n* The Chinese city of Tianjin, which has a population of roughly 14 million people, reportedly asked all municipal governments and government-controlled firms to migrate their data from private sector operators like Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) into a state-controlled cloud database. This comes as regulatory pressure in China intensifies against tech companies.\n* Amazon-backed (AMZN) electric vehicle maker Rivian is reportedly seeking a $70-$80 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO. The company has an agreement to produce electric vans for Amazon and a pickup truck for consumers. In my humble opinion, even being backed by Amazon, this valuation is insane.\n* Apple (AAPL) announced changes to its App Store regulations that will allow software developers to tell customers how to pay for services outside of Apple’s ecosystem, part of a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit. The shift will make it easier for some apps to steer customers toward other forms of payment, rather than using the App Store, where Apple charges a commission of up to 30%.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.\\*\\***\n* Burlington Stores (BURL) with three target raises.
