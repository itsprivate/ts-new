Right now I have a decent amount of money saved up which I am looking to invest in stocks (I already have quite a bit invested in index funds in order to get more spread). Currently my thoughts are:\n\nAAPL due to how much we people use our phones (and probably will continue to).\n\nGOOGL due to their monopoly and rising use.\n\nNVDA/AMD because microchips are going to be used alot in the future.\n\nMSFT\n\nThese are just arguments based on what I have researched on Google/Youtube etc..\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
