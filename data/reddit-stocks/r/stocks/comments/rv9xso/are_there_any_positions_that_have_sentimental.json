He’d explain in basic terms by telling me a pretty good company usually has a lot of customers. Yes that’s not always the case but mind you I was like 6 years old, it was a simple way of getting the basic concepts down.\n\nOne day on my way to my grandparents house, we passed by a McDonalds that had a packed line. As someone who loved McDonalds, along with this new knowledge in mind, I told my grandpa that I wanted to invest in McDonalds since their lines are always long (killer DD). Every year on my birthday he’d put some money into my account, and so he used some of this money and put it into McDonalds as 6 year old me asked.\n\nWell, I’m in college now and have taken complete control of the account, but he still gets the trade confirmations emailed to him. I decided to sell MCD since it didn’t make sense for my strategy and also because I wanted to rebalance my portfolio. However, I had a hard time coming to that conclusion. Ever since I was a kid I’ve been proud to have a part in McDonalds, and it was the first stock I ever picked out on my own. Today my grandpa called and said it was a sad day…he had seen the trade confirmation. \n\nI find it funny how we can become so sentimental over numbers on a screen and insignificant money in a $200 billion company. Do you have any similar stories or positions you’ve become sentimental about?",
