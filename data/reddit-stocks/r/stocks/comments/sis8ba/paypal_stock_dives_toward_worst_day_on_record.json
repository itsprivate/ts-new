  "selftext": "PayPal Holdings Inc.’s rough stretch continued Wednesday after the payment-technology company delivered an outlook that highlighted spending pressures and brought a strategic change in the way the company will approach user growth.\n\nShares PYPL, were off 24.6% in morning trading Wednesday and on track to log their largest single-day percentage decline on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nThe stock has come down 57% from its 52-week intraday high established in July 2021, and is headed for the lowest close since May 2020.\n\nLate Tuesday, PayPal lowered its full-year revenue outlook from the initial target it gave three months back and delivered a full-year earnings forecast that was below the consensus view. The company noted that factors such as inflation, supply pressures, and softer consumer confidence were weighing on spending patterns.\n\nBut “the biggest negative surprise was an abrupt change in strategy to focus more on user engagement (&amp; quality) vs. user growth to drive revenue growth,” wrote Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat.\n\nPayPal executives said they no longer planned to focus on “incentive campaigns” meant to reengage less active users because these didn’t drive sustained spending activity beyond the initial “incentive.” Chief Financial Officer John Rainey called the move a “choice” as PayPal seeks to give priority to financial results over user growth that might not meaningfully impact revenue.\n\n“The new approach sounds sensible to us as many of the new accounts proved less productive,” wrote Susquehanna’s James Friedman, who has a positive rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $220 from $310.\n\nStill, the change came as a shock to analysts. The company “abandoned” its target for 750 million users by 2025, a goal it provided about a year ago and “reiterated throughout the year,” Bernstein’s Rawat said.\n\n“There is a lot to unpack, but we believe this quarter may signal the beginning of the next phase of PYPL’s journey – slow transition to a mature company &amp; [it] may likely bring some aging pains (&amp; multiple compression) in the coming years,” Rawat wrote in her note to clients. She has a market-perform rating on the stock and cut her price target to $140 from $180.\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-stock-dives-toward-worst-day-on-record-after-ugly-earnings-report-11643815782?mod=mw_quote_news",
