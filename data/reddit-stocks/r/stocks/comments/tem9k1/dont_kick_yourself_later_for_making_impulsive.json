Just remember that markets tend to move in cycles. So growth had a huge movement but then cooled. It doesn’t mean they are done forever or will underperform in the future. It’s a return of equilibrium. Same thing with oil prices, value stocks etc. things come into favor with the market and then go out and come back in again. One of the biggest pitfalls is trying to always move your money into whatever is favorable at the moment and selling out of what’s unfavorable. It’s often better to just sit and wait. Growth names will grow again. The S&amp;P will outperform BRK at some point. Commodities will continue to go in and out of favor. Be careful making rash moves or judgements to try and keep up with the market. Diversify, research and don’t make changes to your portfolio unless something has really and truly changed with the business.\n\nGood luck out there everyone",
