  "selftext": "**AvePoint (ticker: AVPT), the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider was just listed publicly on Nasdaq last week.**\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\nCompany's Footprint\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company’s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally. Regarding Microsoft, the company “Bridges the Gap Between What Microsoft Cloud Offers and What the Enterprise Requires”\n\nBlue-Chip Client Base\n\n* Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n\nStrong Financials\n\n* Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fueled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n\nCurrent and Future Potential\n\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\nAbout Apex Tech that merged with Avepoint:\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn’t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs, Served on 20 boards and advisory boards and saw mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Ebay,, Dell, Yahoo! and Twilio\n* Apex’s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex and the private investment owners. Implied enterprise value of 9.0x 2021E revenue with very attractive valuation multiples compared to peers\n\nTransaction Details\n\n**// Advisors**\n\nEvercore Group L.L.C., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Evercore and Cowen In\n\n**// TL;DR - Bottom line**\n\n* AvePoint is a Market leading SaaS company, with powerful tailwinds for Microsoft Cloud, a high quality and diversified customer base and compelling historical & expected financial results, business model and valuation\n* Compared to competitors like JAMF, FASTLY, CLOUDFLARE, etc AVPT is trading at 2-3X discount based on earnings to market cap valuation. Avepoint's earnings are coming up in August which should be followed by price targets from key analysts that will push the price up. \n\n*Disclaimer: This does not constitute and has not to be intended as a financial advice or solicitation of any kind. I hold a long position in AVPT (130,000 shares)*\n\nUPDATE 7/17/21: [Evercore ISI covers AVPT PT at $15](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/evercore-initiates-coverage-on-avepoint-with-outperform-rating-sees-53-upside-1030615884)\n\nUpdate 7/22/21: Goldman Sach's covers AVPT PT at $17\n\nUpcoming Catalysts:  \n\\- 5+ analysts are expected to cover AVPT (PTs).
