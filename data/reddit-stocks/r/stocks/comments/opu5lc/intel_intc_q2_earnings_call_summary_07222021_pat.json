AI market to grow at 20% a year\n- Chip shortage to bottom out in second half but scars will remain for 1-2 years\n- Internal manufacturing efforts for (part of) substrate are already online and helping ship more processors\n- Increased investment in EUV technology\n- Fab construction is progressing well in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland, and Israel\n- Intel Foundry Services - 100 potential customers, signed a major cloud customer for packaging solutions, more news on Monday (07/26/2021)\n- $20B investment in AZ, $3.5B in NM\n- Met with EU leaders, more investment plans in U.S. and EU will be announced before the end of the year\n- We're now manufacturing more 10nm than 14nm overall. Cost dynamics for 10nm are also improving along with higher volume (cost per wafer down 45% YoY with more to come)\n- **Intel accelerated** event on Monday (07/26/2021)\n- Customers continue to choose Intel\n- Record notebook sales, record Q2 revenue, 50M+ Tiger Lake units shipped, launched 12 new processors\n- Expect to ship several million Alder Lake units in the second half, Meteor lake production in 2023\n- Q1 was the low point for data center, improved in Q2, expecting double-digit YoY growth in the second half (for data center group)\n- Mobileye 10 design wins for 60M total cars, deal with Toyota, launched AV testing in NYC, Detroit, Paris, Tokyo\n- Intel Innovation even in October 2021\n- Investor Day - November 18th, 2021\n\n## During Q&A\n- No comments on global foundries M&A rumor. Doesn't rule out acquisition to accelerate foundry business\n- Datacenter margin and revenue hit was due to a mix of competition and process tech ramp\n- Intel targeting a wide range of chip designers for Intel Foundry Services\n- Demand for 5G edge workloads increasing among services providers and Intel is well-positioned to capture the demand\n- Intel pulling some of the finishing/final substrate manufacturing tasks in-house to help ease supply constraints and ship more chips. Still a constrained environment out there\n- Expects stable market share in the second half. The bottom was Q1 for the data center\n\n# George (CFO):\n- **Raising full-year guidance by $1B**\n- **Q2 2021 rev - $18.5B** (up 2% YoY and $0.7B above guidance) vs $17.8B expected by street\n- **EPS - $1.28** (up 12% YoY and $0.23 above guidance) vs $1.06 expected by street\n- **Gross Margin - 59.2%** (2.2% above the guidance)\n- **Free Cash Flow - $5.1B**\n- **Dividend - $1.4B**\n- Data Center revenue challenged by the competitive environment, increased R&D, 10nm prod. ramp and 7nm start-up costs\n- IOTG (Internet of Things Group) revenue up 47% YoY, operating income up 310% YoY\n- Mobileye up 124% YoY\n\n- **Q3 2021 Outlook**\n     - Revenue - $18.2B (up 5% YoY)\n     - Gross Margin - 55% (down 1.5% YoY)\n     - EPS - $1.10 (up 2% YoY)\n\n- **FY 2021 Outlook**\n     - Revenue - $73.5 (up 1% YoY)\n     - Gross Margin - 56.5% (down 2.9% YoY)\n     - EPS - $4.80 (down 6% YoY)\n     - CapEx - $19-20B\n     - Free Cash Flow - $11B\n\n## During Q&A\n- No depreciation left in NAND business from an accounting standpoint\n- As the investment cycle ramps up, more depreciation to account for in the future, more on that during investor/analyst day\n- Intel will be the first customer of their own expanded capacity before opening up to other customers\n- 7nm start-up cost will (negatively) impact margins in the second half\n- No reason to believe that 40-50% data center margins are not achievable in the long term",
