  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>1, blackberry qnx RTOS had been installed on over 175 million cars globally, but this is not the recurring revenue and it is sold by licensing fee by piece. Among those 175 million legacy cars, about 5 dollars per licensing fee, that is the reason why BB stock price was so low in the past years.  </p>\n\n<p>2, But with the blackberry gene of safety, security and mobility, of course with the Iso 26262 and safety highest level, link is following <a href=\"https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications\">https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications</a>,  qnx is embedded in Qualcomm and NVIDIA with long time partnership. So blackberry consolidate ability of the communication and computing, and control the first hand data generated inside the cars.</p>\n\n<p>Some guys don&#39;t believe qnx as OS is working on  nvidia, please Google It. It is official declaration in 2018.  Link is this <a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform\">https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform</a></p>\n\n<p>3,  with those first hand data, blackberry is a emerging big data company, so the exclusive partnership with Amazon lead to the blackberry Ivy platform which will be provided to the carmakers based on a subscription monthly fee, and which would be 55 split between blackberry and Amazon. </p>\n\n<p>4,  why carmaker would need this blackberry Ivy platform? In coming future all carmakers will be a fleet of cars, all cars would be sold at costs and carmakers will survive from the subscription fee from the carowners. Link is here from the boss of the NVIDIA, <a href=\"https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nvidia-ceo-says-software-will-soon-define-car-drive-profit\">https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nvidia-ceo-says-software-will-soon-define-car-drive-profit</a></p>\n\n<p>5, the recurring subscription fee from carmakers will be only a part of the recurring revenue for  blackberry, there is another recurring revenue from the cyber security section which is now wp. 29 (link follows <a href=\"https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/regulations/wp-29-vehicle-cybersecurity/\">https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/regulations/wp-29-vehicle-cybersecurity/</a>),  and beyond that is  ISO/SAE 21434 which is a totally new still under draft, and cross standards of the connected cars. </p>\n\n<p>If someday Tesla declare that they will cooperate with blackberry, that is the necessary step from my view. </p>\n\n<p>Think further and look forward, all the automotive industry will be inspired and reinvented by Tesla, such as  by creating new business mode. </p>\n\n<p>But for the specific function of the car especially for the passenger use, it replys on the safety and security heavily which is a policy and regulation oriented, HUGE MOAT. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
