So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them\nSo with fundsmith equity it&#39;s ran by Terry Smith who&#39;s a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he&#39;s averaged around 15% returns and what&#39;s even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the &quot;lost decade&quot; he averaged 14% return every year.\nHe also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn&#39;t run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet.\nWith the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.\nFinally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure</p>\n\n<p>Some honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe and Microsoft. I like them but won&#39;t buy them because of their valuations</p>\n\n<p>So what are your highest conviction stocks and why ?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
