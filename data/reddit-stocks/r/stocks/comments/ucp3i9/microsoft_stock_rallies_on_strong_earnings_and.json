It’s being boosted by a strong outlook for the June quarter, despite Microsoft expressing some concerns about Covid shutdowns in Chinese factories affecting hardware.\n\nFor the March quarter, Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) posted revenue of $49.4 billion, up 18% from a year ago, and well above the Wall Street consensus forecast of $47.5 billion. The company earned $2.22 a share in the quarter, beating the Wall Street consensus by three cents a share.\n\nMicrosoft noted that results were reduced by about three cents a share by unfavorable exchange rates, while the recent acquisition of Nuance Communications trimmed profits by about a penny a share. Neither of those factors was reflected in previous company guidance. Microsoft has suspended new sales in Russia, but the company previously said that sales in the country are well under 1% of total company revenue. \n\nMicrosoft said commercial bookings in the quarter were better-than-expected, up 28% from a year ago, or 35% adjusted for currency. The company’s commercial cloud business, which includes Azure, Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn’s commercial business and Dynamics 365, had combined revenue of $23.4 billion, up 32%.\n\nMicrosoft had solid results in all three of its business segments.\n\nRevenue in the Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office and other applications, was $15.8 billion, up 17%, toward the top of the company’s guidance range of $15.6 billion to $15.85 billion, and just ahead of the Wall Street consensus for $15.75 billion.\n\nFor the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes the company’s Azure cloud business, revenues were $19.1 billion, up 26%, ahead of both the company’s guidance range of $18.75 billion and $19 billion, and the Wall Street consensus at $18.89 billion. The company’s Azure cloud computing business grew 46% in the quarter, or 49% in constant currency.\n\nFor the More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, Surface and Xbox, revenue was $14.5, likewise ahead of both the company’s guidance range of $14.15 billion to $14.45 billion, and the Wall Street forecast of $14.3 billion.\n\nRevenue was up 34% at LinkedIn, while search and new ad revenue ex-traffic acquisition costs was up 23%. Microsoft doesn’t routinely disclose the size of its overall ad business; last quarter the company noted that on a trailing 12 months basis, the combined ad business had topped $10 billion.\n\nSurface hardware revenue was up 13%, while Xbox hardware revenue was up 14%. Windows Commercial products revenue was up 14%, while Windows OEM revenue, from sales to PCs sold at retail was up 11%. Office commercial products were up 12%, while Office consumer revenue was up 11%.\n\nOn a conference call with investors, CFO Amy Hood projected better-than-expected results for the June quarter.\n\nShe sees revenue for the company’s Productivity and Business Processes segment of between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion, at the midpoint of the range ahead of the Street consensus at $16.68 billion. For Intelligent Cloud, she projects revenue of between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion, ahead of consensus at $20.9 billion.\n\nFor the More Personal Computing segment, she’s projecting a range of $14.65 billion to $14.95 billion, a little below the Street consensus at $14.96 billion, reflecting current Covid-related manufacturing shutdowns in China, which affects both Surface and Xbox hardware, and software sales to PC manufacturers.\n\nOverall, the segment guidance implies a total revenue range of $52.4 billion to $53.2 billion, at the midpoint about in line with Street estimates.\n\nHood said that currency headwinds would reduce revenue in the quarter by about 2 percentage points. She also noted that the June results will include a full quarter of Nuance results. Hood added that results would be reduced by about $110 million from suspending sales in Russia.\n\nMicrosoft said it repurchased $7.8 billion of its common stock in the quarter.\n\nIn volatile after hours trading, Microsoft shares were up 6%, after they fell 3.7% in Tuesday’s regular session.\n\nHeading into the earnings report tonight, Microsoft shares had been down about 20% year to date.",
