But I think the market is still underestimating its potential. \n\nLet's start with the basics. They have consistently blown up earnings.

Their P/E is around 30, which is high, but consistent with other tech stocks. \n\nIt should be noted that a large chunk of their income is invested into high-risk/high-reward research. This inflates the P/E because it cuts down earnings even though the investments improve the potential for larger returns in the future.\n\nThey have what I believe to be the largest moat in the tech sector due to their sheer size, their collection of patents, and their reputation that attracts elite tech workers and researchers. \n\nThat all makes a bull case from their bread-and-butter profit-making, but all of that is arguably priced in and somewhat similar to other large tech companies. So, why do I think that GOOG is not just a bull, but a \\*raging\\* bull? Their research divisions. They have their hand in just about every potentially explosive area of research. \n\nAI/machine learning? I'm a researcher in a field that is tangent to machine learning. Google, DeepMind, GoogleBrain (all under Alphabet=GOOGL/GOOG) are all considered among the most elite places to work in the field. For example, AlphaFold recently created a breakthrough algorithm to simulate protein folding, with a potential to revolutionize drug design. There are lots of good machine learning startups out there, and most of their leaders dream of being bought by GOOG. \n\nQuantum Computing? Google's QuantumAI is breaking new ground so fast that public, government-backed projects can't keep up. No other large company has their hand in this, potentially high-reward, field right now.\n\nMicrochips? Google designed their own TPUs, which are better than GPUs for machine learning, etc. How many software companies design their own chips?\n\nMaybe none of those ever take off for Alphabet, but they'll keep acquiring researchers and companies on the cutting edge of technology and some of them will eventually blast off.\n\nBasically, whatever new tech-related industry blasts off next, you can be sure that Alphabet will have their finger in the pie, if they don't have the whole pie to themselves.\n\nDisclosure: I own two tickers, VTI (88%) and GOOG (12%). \n\nGOOG is down 5% in the last month and I have cash, so I'll probably buy a bunch more.
