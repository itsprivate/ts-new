  "selftext": "Reasons Why I Remain Bullish\n\nHey Psychos!\n\nYou may know me as the guy that writes a the Daily Market Recap. Recently, I've been getting tons of questions asking me why I remain bullish even now. While I never discount market risks or volatility, I believe in the long-run the market (S&P 500) still room to go higher. While the recap broadly covers these points, I want this post to more explicitly cover my reasons. As always, this is simply my humble opinion. This is not meant to be an in-depth post, just my top-line thoughts on the market. This is simply my humble opinion and I would love to hear yours.\n\n**(1) People Overreact to QE Tapering**\n\nUnfortunately, here on Reddit, there is a trove of misinformation spreading around regarding quantitative easing and the effects this has on the economy. To use a crude analogy, QE is like training wheels for a bike, they support you while you are learning, but are not needed once you learn to ride. In the same vein, during the height of the pandemic last year, when people were forced to quarantine and businesses were forced to close their doors, the regular flow of capital was severely disrupted. Therefore, the Fed passed QE measures to bolster, stimulate, and support the economy. Now, we are seeing consumer demand vastly outstrip supply and record growth in corporate earnings. While disruptions still exists stemming from the pandemic and now the surge in the Delta variant, the economy no longer needs its training wheels.\n\nA very similar dynamic played out in 2013. During the 2008 housing collapse and recession, the Fed once again passed QE measures in order to support the economy. Fast forward to 2013 and the Fed decides it is time to taper QE given the economy had broadly recovered and the market absolutely lost its mind for a month or so. This just seems like history repeating itself, people put way too much emphasis on QE, the real test for equities IMO will be when the Fed discusses interest rate hikes.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)\n\n**(2) Pace of Corporate Earnings**\n\nIn Q2, 87% of companies in the S&P 500 beat consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “In an earnings season with many surprises – including the highest frequency of EPS \\[earnings per share\\] beats in our 22-year data history – one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470”.\n\n**(3) Consumer Spending Yet to be Fully Unleashed**\n\nDue to a variety of factors, including the surge in Delta variant and supply-side disruptions, consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP has yet to be unleashed. Due to the multiple stimulus packages passed last year, many Americans have high levels of savings and are cash-rich but have not been able to exercise buying power due to pandemic-related factors. Once the Delta variant begins to recede (there are hopeful signs we have already crested the peak of the wave), I expect supply-side disruptions (which I will discuss more below) to ease up and allow consumer spending, which has been pent up for more than 18 months, to finally unleash.\n\nJust today, the Commerce Department reported a 0.7% climb in sales last month came after a 1.8 percent decline in July and gains earlier in the summer. The gains in August, which were better than what economists expected, were prompted by a rise in spending on clothing, electronics, and furniture, and home goods.\n\n**(4) Supply-Side Disruptions Mean Demand is Higher than Supply**\n\nNowadays, in order to physically produce goods to sell, companies rely on a truly global supply chain with many different links in vastly different geographical areas of the world. When the pandemic hit last year, essentially global supply chains were forced to suddenly stops, throwing a big wrench into the system. As the economy continued recovering and consumer demand starts picking up, restarting a global supply chain takes a lot of time and effort and continues to be disrupted by pandemic-related factors.\n\nSizeable gaps have emerged between factory orders and output. Transportation costs from China to Europe and the US have risen seven to 10 times in the past year. More companies in more sectors are supply-constrained. One particular facet you may be familiar with is the global semiconductor shortage, which has led auto-makers and electronic manufacturers across the world to raise prices and slash production capacity.\n\nMoreover, the labor market remains deeply imbalanced, something that has only intesified during the recent surge in Delta variant cases.  Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, August employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month’s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, “While I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we’ve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.”\n\nMoreover, according to a report released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of job openings in August was 10.9 million, higher than estimates of 9.9 million and 10.18 million last month. The rate of job openings measured against the total labor force swelled to 6.9% in July, up from 6.5% the previous month and 4.6% a year ago. From an industry standpoint, the rate jumped to 10.7% from 10.2% in the critical leisure and hospitality field, which has suffered the most during the Covid-19 pandemic. Openings rose to 1.82 million, a total gain of 134,000 last month. There are enough job openings to cover the roughly 8.4 million unemployed Americans. I see no reason why the slack in the labor market won't start to quickly tighten once Delta variant concerns begin to dissipate, which again would serve to boost consumer spending.",
