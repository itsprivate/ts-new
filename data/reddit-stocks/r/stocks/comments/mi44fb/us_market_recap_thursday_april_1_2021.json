Major indices all posted gains in the holiday-shortened week as S&amp;P 500 and Dow finished at record closes. Energy led the market on stronger crude. Tech, communication services beat the tape (FANMAG complex broadly higher). Consumer staples, healthcare, utilities the only sectors lower. Treasuries mostly firmer with some notable strength at the long end of the curve. Dollar weaker on the major crosses. Gold finished up 0.7%. WTI crude settled up 3.9% despite OPEC and its allies agreeing increase output by ~2M bpd through July.</li>\n<li><strong>Infrastructure continued to dominate the headlines with a lot of moving pieces</strong> after White House detailed plans to spend $2.25T+ over next eight years. Fiscal stimulus still a key piece of the bullish narrative for stocks though plans for another big spending also fit with pickup in concerns about inflation/economic overheating. Higher taxes another potential headwind for risk sentiment. Also some focus on how difficult it will be to get infrastructure stimulus passed given the lack of Republican support, competing preferences among Democrats and their razor-thin majorities in both the House and Senate.</li>\n<li>Busy on the data front ahead of nonfarm payrolls tomorrow. <strong>ISM manufacturing gauge surged in March</strong> with new orders strong, though growing backlogs and supplier delivery times reinforcing broader themes of supply chain pressures and rising input costs. Press has been picking up this theme, noting some consumer-products firms raising prices. Elsewhere, weekly <strong>US initial jobless claims missed</strong>, seeing a larger-than-expected uptick. On the global front, <strong>US-China tensions</strong> another area of focus with more concerns about Chinese incursions into Taiwan.</li>\n<li><strong>TSM</strong> to spend $100B on capex over next three years. <strong>MU</strong> beat and guided above with focus on favorable DRAM dynamics. Company and <strong>WDC</strong> both exploring an acquisition of Japan&#39;s Kioxia for approx. $30B. <strong>KMX</strong> comp sales weaker than expected, though March sales commentary upbeat. <strong>F</strong> announced more shutdowns due to semi shortages. <strong>QS</strong> up big after meeting technical milestone for additional $100M investment from Volkswagen. <strong>CCK</strong> in talks to sell its cans unit for more than $2B. <strong>ANGI</strong> acquired additional 20% interest in its MyBuilder business. <strong>WING</strong> comps better. <strong>EBS</strong> lab errors resulted in 15M ruined <strong>JNJ</strong> vaccine doses (but not expected to impact US supply targets). <strong>PLAY</strong> beat and guidance ahead on better reopening pace but stock already a big ytd gainer. <strong>GES</strong> EPS well ahead of consensus and guidance better with digital a bright spot.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Digest</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Most sectors higher with growth ahead of value:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Growth generally led cyclical/value on first day of Q2. <strong>Energy</strong> the standout, following WTI higher with E&amp;Ps particularly strong. <strong>Tech</strong> a big gainer with help from semis and software (MSFT also had a good day). Internets and entertainment the leaders in <strong>communication services</strong>. <strong>Financials</strong> ahead on upside across credit cards and insurance, while banks mostly brushed off Treasury yields move lower down today. <strong>Consumer discretionary</strong> trailed with some weakness among retailers offsetting support from AMZN and homebuilders. <strong>Materials</strong> saw some drag from industrial metals, with steel the weak spot. <strong>Industrials</strong> a bit of an underperformer with select machinery and multis down. <strong>Healthcare</strong> mixed with some weakness in managed care, distributors, and large-cap pharma (JNJ). <strong>Consumer staples</strong> worst performer with HPCs, tobacco, and grocers some of the weights.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>ISM Manufacturing highest in over 37 years, initial jobless claims and continuing claims miss:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>March ISM Manufacturing</strong> PMI up 3.9 points m/m to 64.7, ahead of 61.5 estimate, for highest print since Dec-1983. New Orders, production indexes highest since Jan-04, employment index highest since Feb-18. Supplier deliveries continued to slow, up to highest reading since Apr-1974. Prices also elevated, holding near highest since Jul-08. <strong>Initial jobless claims</strong> of 719K were up 61K w/w, and missed consensus estimates for 690K. However, prior week revised down 26K to 658K from 684K, which was lowest since the pandemic surge in claims began in Mar-20. <strong>Continuing claims</strong> fell to 3.794M from 3.870M, though also missed estimates for 3.775M. While this week&#39;s claims will not flow through to tomorrow&#39;s March jobs report (2-Apr, 8:30 ET), labor market data in focus given reopening and vaccine-driven economic momentum. <strong>March nonfarm payrolls</strong> expected to increase by 285K m/m to 614K, which would be the highest since Oct-20.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>OPEC+ agrees to gradual output increases of 1M bpd over the coming months:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/opec-agrees-to-gradually-increase-oil-output-in-coming-months?srnd=premium&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B\">Bloomberg</a> reported that OPEC and its allies agreed to gradually boost oil output from May to July. The group will add more than 1M bpd over the coming months, incluidng a 350K bpd increase from Saudi Arabia and Russia in May, and an additional 450K bpd in July. Saudi Arabia may also roll back some of its voluntary 1M bpd cuts. While market had expected group to roll over existing limits, article cited analysts who say product demand is expected rise by 3M bpd over the next three months, so increase isn&#39;t bearish. Comes against a lot of recent talk of caution from the group, with OPEC Secretary General Barkindo yesterday saying the oil market faces many uncertainties, particularly regarding a Covid upsurge in Europe and elsewhere (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/opec-focuses-on-fragile-demand-before-talks-on-keeping-oil-cuts?sref=J9GPLx1B\">Bloomberg</a>), while OPEC+ technical committee this week cut 2021 global demand forecast by 300K bpd.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Afternoon headlines:</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Markets:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Some troubling signals from first IPOs of Q2 include poor trading, postponements, reduced deal sizes (<a href=\"https://bloom.bg/3fzYiUG\">Bloomberg</a>)</li>\n<li>Strategists see more junk-rated bond outperformance with rising yields (<a href=\"https://bloom.bg/31CqjCP\">Bloomberg</a>)</li>\n<li>Turkey sees biggest outflows in 15 years after replacement of hawkish central bank leader (<a href=\"https://bloom.bg/3mjvHnJ\">Bloomberg</a>)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Coronavirus:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine remains highly effective for six months after second dose, indicating protection could last even longer (<a href=\"https://on.wsj.com/3fvB41O\">WSJ</a>)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Corporate:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>United says it will hire hundreds of pilots to prepare for travel recovery (<a href=\"https://cnb.cx/3u927Uw\">CNBC</a>)</li>\n<li>AMC Entertainment looking for approval to issue as many as 500M shares after shares jumped 350% YTD (<a href=\"https://bloom.bg/2PqG4tY\">Bloomberg</a>)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Notable Gainers:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>+15% <strong>UTHR</strong> (United Therapeutics): Announced FDA has approved Tyvaso for pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease; noted this is the second FDA-approved indication for Tyvaso.</li>\n<li>+10.2% <strong>QS</strong> (QuantumScape): Announced it had successfully tested its latest solid-state lithium metal cells in a German lab, meeting a technical milestone unlocks an investment of an additional $100M by Volkswagen of America (VOW3.GR).</li>\n<li>+6.9% <strong>WDC</strong> (Western Digital): Cited in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-western-digital-looking-at-possible-deal-for-chip-maker-kioxia-11617229660?mod=hp_lead_pos3\">WSJ</a> article as exploring a deal for Japan&#39;s Kioxia which specializes in NAND chips where the industry has been consolidating; firms currently have a joint R&amp;D venture through 2027; a deal would likely be valued near $30B though MU also mentioned as a suitor; Toshiba (6502.JP) spun off the company in 2018 but still owns 40% and stated it is considering further investment; <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/japan-s-kioxia-is-said-to-focus-on-ipo-in-next-few-months\">Bloomberg</a> reported Kioxia is more interested in an IPO.</li>\n<li>+6.8% <strong>WING</strong> (Wingstop): Preliminary Q1 sales figures better than expected with analysts positive on comp momentum and unit sales growth; takes optimistic given digital strength and solid unit economics though some concerns about tough comps ahead.</li>\n<li>+4.8% <strong>MU</strong> (Micron Technology): FQ2 earnings and revenue beat with guidance well ahead; analysts noted a tight DRAM market and expense cuts brought gross margin gains; company is among potential suitors (WDC, 6502.JP) for Japan&#39;s Kioxia with value expected to be around $30B; semiconductor company specializes in NAND for smartphones and computer servers.</li>\n<li>+4.7% <strong>VSAT</strong> (ViaSat): Upgraded to strong buy from outperform at Raymond James; expects significant growth potential from launch of ViaSat-3 constellation; positive on recovery in In-Flight Connectivity and said competitive concerns overblown.</li>\n<li>+4.5% <strong>GES</strong> (Guess?): Q4 revenue missed, but EPS beat; Americas comp decline better than feared; GM; management said it plans to achieve by FY 25 10% OMs and net revenues of $2.9B, a 2% CAGR from FY20; analysts positive on Q1 guidance of revenues down HSD vs Q1-20, highlighting ecomm tailwinds offsetting some brick-and-mortar weakness.</li>\n<li>+2.2% <strong>GRA</strong> (W.R.
