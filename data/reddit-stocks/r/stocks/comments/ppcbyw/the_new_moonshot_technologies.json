  "selftext": "BofA Global Research released a 152-page research report identifying  14 “*radical technologies that could change our lives and accelerate the  impact of global megatrends.*” The technologies have a $330B market size  today that could grow to $6.4T by the 2030s, strategists led by Haim  Israel say. “*These moonshots could transform and disrupt multiple  industries, contributing to the next big cycle of technology-driven  growth.*” Israel says. The 14 are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **6G**:  “The next generation of telecom networks will be needed in less than a  decade as data continues to grow exponentially and 5G reaches its upper  limit capacity.”\n* **Brain Computer Interfaces**:  “As we reach a point where humans are unable to keep up with computers  and AI, brain computer interfaces could help ‘level up’ humans with  computers. Shorter term, brain computer interfaces hold solutions for  paralyzed individuals and promise a new wave of innovation in gaming.”\n* **Emotional Artificial Intelligence**:  Also “known as 'Affective Computing' and 'Cognitive Computing' (it) is  designed to capture, analyze and respond to human emotions and simulate  human thoughts. EAI can potentially collect, analyze and respond to  completely new varieties of data and situations and predict or simulate  human thought, leading people to take action.”\n* **Synthetic Biology**:  “At its core, 'synbio', as the field is commonly referred to, takes  advantage of the vast diversity of nature to make biomolecules that  traditional chemistry cannot.”\n* **Immortality**:  “Traditionally, aging has not been viewed as a disease that can be  treated but this is changing. Actors in this space are increasingly  looking to tackle the hallmark of aging via pathways such as genomic  instability, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular  senescence among others.”\n* **Bionic humans**:  “This could be invasive (e.g. implants) or non-invasive (e.g.  exoskeleton). Biohacking is also an associated field which is  essentially applying DIY biology to boost oneself e.g. RFID chip in hand  for contactless payments.”\n* **eVTOL**:  “Electrical vertical take-off and landing vehicles that could provide an  alternative mobility transportation solution to outdated infrastructure  and overly stressed roads in urban settings.”\n* **Wireless Electricity**:  “As the IoT takes off, automating and creating near continuous charging  solutions could provide convenience for consumers, while solving  charging problems for the rollout of EVs and secure electricity supplies  for remote communities.”\n* **Holograms**: “A  technology capable of creating a simulated environment through light  imagery projections that will allow everyone to come together in one  virtual room, without having to leave their physical location.”\n* **Metaverse**:  “A future iteration of the Internet, made up of persistent, shared,  3D-shared spaces linked into a virtual universe. It could comprise  countless persistent virtual worlds that interoperate with one another,  as well as the physical world and transforming markets such as gaming,  retail, entertainment etc.”\n* **Nextgen Batteries**:  “Whilst lithium batteries are the major EV technology, this does not  necessarily need to stay true with alternatives such as solid state,  vanadium flow, sodium ion etc provide promising additional attributes.”\n* **OceanTech**:  “It seeks to answer: ‘How do we increase sustainability of the ocean  economy while harnessing its benefits?’ Solutions could include ocean  energy, land based aquaculture, and precision fishing using AI.”\n* **Green Mining**:  “Transitioning away from a carbon-intensive economy will mean moving to  a metal-intensive one. Green mining solutions like deep-sea mining,  agromining, mining of wastewater and asteroid mining could provide less  polluting and destructive solutions as the green economy’s thirst for  metals grows.”\n* **Carbon Capture and Storage**:  “All current zero-carbon pathways require some form of CO2 removal. CCS,  alongside other geoengineering solutions, could act as part of the  solution with long-term permanent removal of CO2 vs afforestation.”\n\n[https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izsrvpss9WiY/v0/-1x-1.png](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izsrvpss9WiY/v0/-1x-1.png)\n\n**Lower lifespan**: The lifespan of S&P 500 incumbents is shortening and by 2027 components could last just 12  years before being replaced, BofA says. For Next Tech to succeed, first  the innovation must have the potential to be economical, then it must  solve a key problem or improve quality of life, and finally, there must  be government support in some way. Risks to the 14 ideas include the  tech not being commercially scalable, prohibitive costs outweighing the  benefits and regulation limiting applicability.",
