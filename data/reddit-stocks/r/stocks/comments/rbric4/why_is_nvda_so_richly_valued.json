I primarily invest by DCA into ETFs like SPY, QQQ and DIA. I've also decided to branch out by nibbling on individual stocks within the QQQ. I find NVDA interesting and hold a small position from when it was $226/share, I think it has a good business model, a good history of profitability and it has an edge over other chipmakers in the sense that they're the best at graphics technology.\n\nHowever, I can't understand why people continue buying into NVDA stock at current values where the PE is 95+ NVDA has the potential to grow no doubt, but does it really have the potential to grow at a rate that justifies such a rich valuation today? Or is it just that traders/WSB types are playing games with the stock?\n\nWouldn't a better investment be to look elsewhere in the semiconductor industry for better deals? I like MU (PE: 17) because RAM and storage is needed universally for pretty much anything that needs a chip, AMAT (PE: 26) because they make equipment for foundries which means if NVDA wins, AMAT wins. Investing in TSM (PE: 31) might be good for similar reasons as AMAT.\n\nI acknowledge that I don't know too much about investing (obviously) and don't even know necessarily much about reading up on fundamentals. I mainly look at PE, PEG and look at the historical gains of the stock and company. I'd just like to have a better understanding.\n\nCheers everyone.",
