The FDA will decide the approval of a drug created by AUPH called Voclosporin on January 22nd (This Friday), a drug that only has one other competitor in the market now.</p>\n\n<p>- Voclospoin has a near-guaranteed chance of being approved with its stage three trials performed over a year ago basically meeting the FDA approval requirements.</p>\n\n<p>- Once FDA approval arrives, estimates of AUPH revenues generated from this drug will be $1.5B to $3B a year</p>\n\n<p>- The company has great financials including over $400M in cash</p>\n\n<p>- Insiders of AUPH have huge holdings in AUPH stock, with the chairman George M. Milne buying 20,000 shares (over a quarter of a million) of AUPH in December, which increases his stake to more than half a million. </p>\n\n<p>I believe the stock will go up to around $23 once FDA approval arrives. This prediction is based on what happened back in 2019 when stage 3 clinical trials were released and the stock went to $21. All analysts currently have a &quot;Buy Rating&quot; on the stock and the average PT is well over $20, with many saying it can be $30.   </p>\n\n<p>Do your own DD, but I have 30% of my life savings in this stock right now.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395615-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-offers-good-entry-opportunity-next-pdufa-for-voclosporin\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395615-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-offers-good-entry-opportunity-next-pdufa-for-voclosporin</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
