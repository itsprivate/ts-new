Tesla is a 1 trillion dollar company, trading at a P/E of 330, a similar multiple for FCF, a P/S of around 30 for an automaker, and many more insane multiples while growing 50% on the extremely high side and about 35-40% for just a few more years in my opninion. Okay, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK WE ARE IN A GIANT FUCKING BUBBLE, let that sink in, THEY ARE WORTH A TRILLION FUCKING DOLLARS, WITH ONLY 46 BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND ONLY 3.4 BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT, THEY WERE LITERALLY UNPROFITABLE ONLY 3 YEARS AGO, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. I DONT GIVE A SHIT IF THEY ARE GROWING, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY JUST GO UP FOREVER BECAUSE THIS IS SO FUCKING RIDICULOUS.\n\nTESLA IS NOT A FUCKING CAR COMPANY, GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THIK FUCKING HEAD, THEY HAVE MARGINS WORSE THAN A CAR COMPANY YET FOR SOME INSANE REASON THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS ONE, ALSO, EVEN WITH 50% GROWTH THEY ARE STILL AT A PEG OF OVER 6 AND PUT INTO A DCF ASSUMING THE MOST BULLISH OF GROWTH ESTIMATES THEY ARE RIDICULOUSLY FUCKING OVERVALUED TO AN EXTENT NEVER SEEN BEFORE.\n\nOk, I don't know what the actual fuck to say, it's so obvious that they're overvalued, and there are no reasons for why it should have reached this point, and maybe I just don't get it, but idk, maybe I'm doing something wrong, your thoughts?
