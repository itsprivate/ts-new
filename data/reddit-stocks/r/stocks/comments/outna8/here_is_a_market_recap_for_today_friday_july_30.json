  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 30, 2021**\n\nStocks fell Friday, reversing after yesterday’s gains to cap off one of the choppier weeks we’ve had in the market all year. The choppiness largely seems to stem from very erratic movements after-hours after companies report earnings. In my humble opinion, a lot of these movements seem like overreactions to me and represent nice opportunities. Moreover, this week market participants digested a weaker-than-expected print in GDP growth and the Federal Reserve’s July Monetary Policy Report. \n\nDespite the volatility, all three major indexes closed the month higher, capping the six consecutive month of gains. As of today’s close, the S&P 500 (SPY) is up 18.04% year-to-date. Absolutely insane. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued it’s streak of underperformance, closing the month 3.77% lower. \n\nCore personal consumption expenditures (PCE) grew at a faster year-on-year rate in June than in May, reflecting ongoing upward price pressures as demand surges during the recovery. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that core PCE grew 3.5% in June over last year, topping May's 3.4% rate. Still, however, this was less hot than the 3.7% pace consensus economists expected.\n\nYesterday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1\n* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1\n\nThe July Monetary Policy Report was largely reiterated the same thing it has been for the last 3-4 months, but did include did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The statement read, “Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.”\n\nMoreover, the Fed athe report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nThis week, the five largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) all reported earnings. Despite all of them handily beating top-line estimates, a lot of them actually pulled back.

Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?” - Li Lu",
