Please correct me if I&#39;m spewing shit, I&#39;m just trying to make sense of this thing.</p>\n\n<p>Jan.25: News breaks out that Citadel and Point72 are investing $2.75 billions In Melvin (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340\">link to wsj article</a>). The article says that Melvin started the year with $12.5 billions in assets, and lost ~30% through Friday, according to <em>people familiar with the firm</em>. The deal was put together on Monday, <em>i.e.</em> the same day the news came (fast writing!). Friday $GME closed at $65.</p>\n\n<p>Following the math in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5jwnj/melvin_is_down_another_25_on_gme/\">this other post</a>, Melvin loses ~$1bn for each $12 increase in $GME price, which pans out to Melvin being under the water when GME hits ~$200.</p>\n\n<p>Tuesday (26th), The price went from ~$88 at open to ~$148 at close. It opened the day after (the 27th) at ~$355, closing at ~$348.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I have no idea how a hedge fund as big as Melvin handles their trades, but I assume they have a bank, brokerage, or whatever, that margin calls them when they fuck up. Following the maths above, they should have been margin called at some point between Tuesday the 26th and Wednesday the 27th. Thursday the 28th, the price reached almost $500 a share (I believed it reached it in premarket). Again following the calculations above, that pans out to <strong><em>two Melvins and a half worth of GME that had to be paid back</em></strong>. That&#39;s like <strong><em>$38 billions</em></strong>. And that&#39;s just with the price as it was at some point on Thursday. With the ultra low liquidity and all the people holding like their lives depend on it, you <em>know</em> covering would have cost <strong><em>way</em></strong> more than that (this is just Melvin. The total amount of money needed to cover all shorted shares is <em>way</em> higher, but that would be distributed among who knows how many people, and we don&#39;t know their entry points, so that&#39;s impossible to estimate).</p>\n\n<p>Question: <strong><em>who the fuck was going to pay for it</em></strong>? Because Melvin sure wasn&#39;t. Would their broker be able to? To we know what kind of broker a hedge fun like Melvin uses, and the type of funds they have at their disposal?</p>\n\n<p>Another question: I can imagine a margin call and full liquidation of a huge hedge fund like Melvin is not something that happens in the span of a few hours (correct me if I&#39;m wrong). This makes me wonder: <strong>what if the margin call</strong> <strong><em>did</em></strong> <strong>come for Melvin, but by the time it was processed, the debt  was so big that</strong> <strong><em>no chance in hell</em></strong> <strong>their broker/bank/whatever would have been able/willing to cover the rest?</strong></p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, RH and many other brokers suddenly decided to stop allowing people to buy GME. Webull&#39;s CEO, in an interview on ZingerNation, pretty much said that they were forced to stop allowing buying of GME by their clearinghouse, because they risked otherwise not having the money to give people when they wanted to sell it in the future (it seems I can&#39;t link the youtube video of the interview, sorry). He even mentioned (as &quot;an example&quot;), that if Melvin is not able to cover their debt, then it was their broker&#39;s job to cover it for them, and if the broker couldn&#39;t the clearing house had to pay. Now if all these institutions don&#39;t have enough money to pay for the debt, <strong><em>you get a total market meltdown</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So, with all this in mind, I wonder, <strong><em>if people hold and the price doesn&#39;t budge, who is going to shill out the many billions to cover for Melvin&#39;s and co. recklessness?</em></strong> Like seriously, how do they get out of this situation? Who is going to suck up such an amount of losses at this stage? Do these guys have insurance for this sort of situation? And what kind of money would these company have?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
