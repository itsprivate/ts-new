I learned about NIO over two years ago when they were featured on 60 Minutes and was one of the first active users on <a href=\"/r/Nio\">r/Nio</a>. Back then, the stock was 10$, and I bought 500 shares. But after their IPO, they had a rough year with declining sales. Despite that, I kept buying in to eventually accumulate 3,200 shares at an average price of 3.12$.</p>\n\n<p>But then came more bad news and worse sales. People were talking about the company running out of cash and the stock going to 0$, and they did eventually hit 1.00$. I sold at 1.78$ before that happened and took my 57% loss.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve only been investing for two years, but it&#39;s my biggest regret so far. I should have never listened to some asshole at Bloomberg getting paid to write negative articles and trusted my gut. NIO is a solid company and is going to be one the leaders in the Chinese and global EV market. They completely restructured after those losses (Nio Places vs. Nio Houses, fired staff, etc.), and those 3,200 shares are worth over 150,000$ today. They&#39;ll be worth even more in the future.</p>\n\n<p>All I can do now is take this as a learning experience, but I feel like I&#39;ll never find another stock like them. Sigh ...</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Someone here contacted the Reddit Care Team. Thank you for the laugh ...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
