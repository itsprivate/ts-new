I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 28th, 2022.\n\n# **With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.\n*****\n&gt; Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; “Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; “I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”\n*****\n&gt; # Market reversal\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.\n*****\n&gt; “Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”\n*****\n&gt; Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.\n*****\n&gt; “The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.\n*****\n&gt; “In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed rate hikes\n&gt; Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.\n*****\n&gt; “We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”\n*****\n&gt; Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.\n*****\n&gt; A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.\n*****\n&gt; “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.\n*****\n&gt; However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.\n*****\n&gt; Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.\n*****\n&gt; Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs\n&gt; In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.\n*****\n&gt; “We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.\n*****\n&gt; # Boiling oil\n&gt; Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.\n*****\n&gt; “That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.\n*****\n&gt; # Bullish bet?\n&gt; Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.\n*****\n&gt; “We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&amp;P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&amp;P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.\n*****\n&gt; The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&amp;P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.\n*****\n&gt; Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; “It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&amp;P futures.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Tdz8Nil.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mfR9dau.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0AraPN3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/9m8Ciws.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/CPUwSmv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cb627tv.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JeFb9DW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C5k6EBO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4ExqQH1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gDEhF7g.jpg))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0ykzTd9.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/d6zIsZR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xFOFiUh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/L1tLUp6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/rf0orxc.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/PfGSbay.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #6!](https://i.imgur.com/BcYpguI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Cold War 2.0 – Midterm Bottom Nears\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/feb25bd4cdbe0ffd38abe3b85d7ef57c/ec436ef0b8793cc1-b0/s500x750/1a889a3555ac7f2bd39bd75e8f97cd37e16a7d3c.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.\n\n&gt; It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.\n\n&gt; However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&amp;P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84c65c4f2a7683437c93d7531b76b56f/ec436ef0b8793cc1-94/s500x750/4586e8dda39e162b561432165f5c7d395914187c.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Move Into A Correction\n\n&gt; For the first time since March 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?\n\n&gt; “Let’s remember the S&amp;P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png))**\n\n&gt; What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-2.png))**\n\n&gt; With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&amp;P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2.23.22-3.png))**\n\n***** \n\n&gt; # March Almanac: Stronger in Midterm Years\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cad7fd5b775831b161f6fc6bae6c0cf3/60038cec3dd948c5-b9/s500x750/59653b47e7587257652fa17d91ae4d0d0b6297c3.jpg))**\n\n&gt; As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&amp;P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81721f651699b34d9ab5f80019ec5ecb/60038cec3dd948c5-ce/s500x750/d3957fc5a070554b930922fc7884d8a14ca1b420.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Normally a solid performing market month, March improves in midterm-election years. In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been up for five of the last six midterm Marchs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ad29b5b2f1d6f8eeac6454bea2916b95/60038cec3dd948c5-16/s400x600/0b720fdeeb653c97820c99eafd7589e1f8df765b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine\n\n&gt; Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”\n\n&gt; Here we list 11 things you need to know.\n&gt; * While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\n&gt; * Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**\n\n&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n&gt; * Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.\n&gt; * Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**\n\n&gt; * We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.\n&gt; * As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**\n\n&gt; * Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.\n&gt; * European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.\n&gt; * There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.\n&gt; * Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**\n\n&gt; * From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.\n\n&gt; This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.16.22-Blog-Chart-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?\n\n&gt; Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.\n\n&gt; “The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”\n\n&gt; The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&amp;P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**\n\n&gt; As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.\n\n&gt; Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&amp;P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**\n\n&gt; The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**\n\n&gt; After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gDEhF7g.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/tBCvUvy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE NOTABLE EARNINGS BEFORE THE OPEN ON MONDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/aombRIJ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.28.22 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n3GzQiG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.28.22 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK# 1!](https://i.imgur.com/yuxliBQ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK# 2!](https://i.imgur.com/TSRbDEE.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK# 3!](https://i.imgur.com/PiXNJXC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.1.22 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/v98nAdr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ky3f6rg.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.1.22 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wuvQ16Z.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jPlXXqd.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.2.22 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/99QCULy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.2.22 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZHqLCGC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8edC0FX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.3.22 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NWypw84.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.3.22 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/pruNvAy.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wJYLgWK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.4.22 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/rAZwJwg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.4.22 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # SoFi $10.67\n**SoFi (SOFI)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:10 PM ET on Tuesday, March 1, 2022.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 28th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html\"&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Market reversal&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Fed rate hikes&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Jobs, jobs, jobs&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Boiling oil&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Bullish bet?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&amp;amp;P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&amp;amp;P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&amp;amp;P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&amp;amp;P futures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Tdz8Nil.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P Sectors for this past week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mfR9dau.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices for this past week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0AraPN3.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Futures Markets as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/9m8Ciws.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/CPUwSmv.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Cb627tv.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JeFb9DW.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/C5k6EBO.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&amp;#39;s close:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4ExqQH1.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gDEhF7g.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the upcoming IPO&amp;#39;s for this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0ykzTd9.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&amp;#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp;amp; Downgrades:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/d6zIsZR.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/xFOFiUh.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/L1tLUp6.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/rf0orxc.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/PfGSbay.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/BcYpguI.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #6!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Cold War 2.0 – Midterm Bottom Nears&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/feb25bd4cdbe0ffd38abe3b85d7ef57c/ec436ef0b8793cc1-b0/s500x750/1a889a3555ac7f2bd39bd75e8f97cd37e16a7d3c.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/84c65c4f2a7683437c93d7531b76b56f/ec436ef0b8793cc1-94/s500x750/4586e8dda39e162b561432165f5c7d395914187c.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Stocks Move Into A Correction&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time since March 2020, the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s remember the S&amp;amp;P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&amp;amp;P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&amp;amp;P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-2.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&amp;amp;P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2.23.22-3.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;March Almanac: Stronger in Midterm Years&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/cad7fd5b775831b161f6fc6bae6c0cf3/60038cec3dd948c5-b9/s500x750/59653b47e7587257652fa17d91ae4d0d0b6297c3.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp;amp; 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&amp;amp;P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/81721f651699b34d9ab5f80019ec5ecb/60038cec3dd948c5-ce/s500x750/d3957fc5a070554b930922fc7884d8a14ca1b420.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally a solid performing market month, March improves in midterm-election years. In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&amp;amp;P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best. DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been up for five of the last six midterm Marchs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/ad29b5b2f1d6f8eeac6454bea2916b95/60038cec3dd948c5-16/s400x600/0b720fdeeb653c97820c99eafd7589e1f8df765b.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we list 11 things you need to know.\n* While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\n* Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-3.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-4.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.16.22-Blog-Chart-5.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&amp;amp;P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&amp;amp;P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gDEhF7g.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&amp;#39;S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/tBCvUvy.png\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&amp;#39;S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/aombRIJ.jpg\"&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE NOTABLE EARNINGS BEFORE THE OPEN ON MONDAY!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp;amp;
