Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, March 2nd, 2021-</h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-2-2021.html\">5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday</a></h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>1. Stocks set to drop after S&amp;P 500′s best day since June</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. stock futures dipped Tuesday after starting March with a broad rally. Shaking off the late February rough patch, the S&amp;P 500 on Monday gained 2.4% for its biggest one-day advance since June. Covid vaccine optimism and the 10-year Treasury yield off its one-year high spurred stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 603 points, or 2%. The Nasdaq, which shed 4.9% in last week’s tech sell-off, popped 3%. The Dow and Nasdaq had their best sessions since November.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>2. Target, Kohl’s quarterly results beat estimates</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Target on Tuesday exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, thanks to a strong holiday season and stimulus checks. Still, Target declined to provide a forecast for the year ahead, saying the pandemic has made it too difficult to predict consumer patterns. Target reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.67 per share on revenue of $28.34 billion, which jumped 21% year over year. Shares were little changed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shares of Kohl’s rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the department store chain Tuesday delivered adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.22 per share, more than double estimates. Revenue of $5.88 billion, which fell 10% year over year, was slightly better than expectations. Kohl’s said it sees sales growth in 2021.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>3. Zoom Video shares surge after earnings, sales skyrocket</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of Zoom Video Communications rose 8% in Tuesday’s premarket, the morning after the company reported adjusted fourth-quarter profit of $1.22 per share, crushing estimates by 43 cents. Revenue surged 369% year-over-year to $882.5 million, also beating forecasts. Zoom, which became all the rage during Covid, issued an upbeat current quarter forecast in anticipation of millions of people and businesses continuing to use its video-calling platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>4. Senate Democrats work on their version of Covid relief bill</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Democrats’ hopes of including a federal minimum wage increase in their $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill seemed all but dead, four days after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian said the chamber’s rules prohibited its inclusion. Senate Democrats hope to unveil their version of the House-passed package and begin debate as early as Wednesday. Congressional leaders want to send President Joe Biden the measure by March 14, when a federal jobless benefits boost, approved in December’s aid measure, is set to expire.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>5. Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduces a wealth tax</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sen. Elizabeth Warren revived the idea of a wealth tax, which was central to her failed bid to become the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who also ran unsuccessfully for president last year advocating a wealth tax, is among the co-sponsors for the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act. The bill, unveiled Monday, proposes a 2% annual tax on wealth ranging from $50 million to $1 billion and a 3% annual tax on wealth over $1 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://finviz.com/futures.ashx\">CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>YESTERDAY&#39;S MARKET MAP:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/DvyW1w5.png\">CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY&#39;S MARKET MAP!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>TODAY&#39;S MARKET MAP:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://finviz.com/map.ashx\">CLICK HERE FOR TODAY&#39;S MARKET MAP!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>YESTERDAY&#39;S S&amp;P SECTORS:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/lsFuLQ9.png\">CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY&#39;S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>TODAY&#39;S S&amp;P SECTORS:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://finviz.com/groups.ashx\">CLICK HERE FOR TODAY&#39;S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>TODAY&#39;S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/6lz8dbc.png\">CLICK HERE FOR TODAY&#39;S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>THIS WEEK&#39;S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/zRvHdP7.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK&#39;S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>THIS WEEK&#39;S UPCOMING IPO&#39;S:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/PbURZ3R.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK&#39;S UPCOMING IPO&#39;S!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>THIS WEEK&#39;S EARNINGS CALENDAR:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oqzviWR.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK&#39;S EARNINGS CALENDAR!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>THIS MORNING&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eifOGQ4.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING&#39;S EARNINGS CALENDAR!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0gNg2zN.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING&#39;S EARNINGS RELEASES!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/KtBFbfB.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON&#39;S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>YESTERDAY&#39;S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/1uB1gET.png\">CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY&#39;S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/R1PMgTX.png\">CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY&#39;S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/9xDq1mF.png\">CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY&#39;S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>YESTERDAY&#39;S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZWtp2wv.png\">CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY&#39;S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fNaHXMS.png\">CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY&#39;S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>TODAY&#39;S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong><a href=\"https://i.postimg.cc/J0Ysm2SN/divical2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR TODAY&#39;S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>THIS MORNING&#39;S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:</h1>\n\n<h6>(<strong>source: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-zoom-video-novavax-nio-more.html\">cnbc.com</a></strong>)</h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Zoom Video (ZM)</strong> – Zoom reported quarterly profit of $1.22 per share, beating the consensus estimate of 79 cents a share.
