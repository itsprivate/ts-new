  "selftext": "**PscyhoMarket Recap - Friday, January 28, 2022**\n\nAfter an extremely volatile week, the stock market surged on the back of Apple’s (AAPL) monster earnings report, with market participants hoping positive earnings in the largest companies in the market will bring some relief from recent volatility. Moreover, new economic data showed the US economy continues to progress despite rising prices and surging Omicron infections.\n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +2.48%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +3.14%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.63%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.95%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -9.28%\n* 10-year Treasury Yield: 1.778%\n* Apple (AAPL): +6.98%\n* Amazon (AMZN): +3.11%\n* Alphabet (GOOG): +3.23%\n* Shopify (SHOP): 6.92%\n* Affirm (AFRM): +17.06%\n* Yoshitsu (TKLF): +33.33%\n* Robinhood (HOOD): from -14.04% to +9.65%\n\nConsidering ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain and the persistent semiconductor shortage that has deeply affected all electronic manufacturers, Apple (AAPL) posted one of the most impressive quarters ever considering the circumstances, buoying the entire market during a period of exceptional volatility. Here are the numbers: \n\n* **EPS**: $2.10 vs. $1.89 estimated, up 25% year-over-year\n* **Revenue**: $123.9 billion vs. $118.66 billion estimated, up 11% year-over-year\n* **Quarterly Profit**: $34.6 billion \n* **iPhone revenue**: $71.63 billion vs. $68.34 billion estimated, up 9% year-over-year\n* **Services revenue**: $19.52 billion vs. $18.61 billion estimated, up 24% year-over-year\n* **Other Products revenue**: $14.70 billion vs. $14.59 billion estimated, up 13% year-over-year\n* **Mac revenue**: $10.85 billion vs. $9.52 billion estimated, up 25% year-over-year\n* **iPad revenue**: $7.25 billion vs. $8.18 billion estimated, down 14% year-over-year\n* **Gross margin**: 43.8% vs. 41.7% estimated\n\nDuring a call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said the company, “experienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter”, but he declined to give a specific number. For context, in Q3, Apple said supply-chain constraint cost the company more than $6 billion in revenue. \n\nCook continues, “We pride ourselves in getting products to customers who really want them, and we try to do that on a fast basis, and so it’s frustrating that we can’t always do that at the speed we would like. However, March is better than December, and so there are some encouraging signs there. I think our supply chain actually does very good considering the shortages because it’s a fast-moving supply chain.” \n\nThis morning, the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation rose 4.9% compared from a year ago, the largest YoY rise since September 1983. The Department of Commerce released personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which tracks the value of goods and services purchased in the US, rose 5.8%. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and serves as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, rose 4.9% year-over-year.\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/news/2022/personal-income-and-outlays-december-2021](https://www.bea.gov/news/2022/personal-income-and-outlays-december-2021)\n\nDespite elevated inflation, The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released its first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. For the full-year 2021, GDP grew at a 5.7% rate, marking the fastest since 1984. And this marked a sharp reversal from the contraction seen in the economy in 2020 when GDP shrank by 3.4%. Here were the main metrics from the print, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\n\n* **GDP quarter-over-quarter, annualized:** 6.9% vs. 5.5% expected, 2.3% in Q3\n* **Personal consumption:** 3.3% vs. 3.4% expected, 2.0% in Q3\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter**: 4.9% vs. 4.9% expected, 4.6% in Q3\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed released their monthly monetary policy decision and Chair Jerome Powell gave his press conference, which contributed to the volatility we are experiencing. The Fed held rates at near-zero and reaffirmed plans to finish tapering by March, at which point we will likely see the first interest rate hike of the year. Higher rates could address inflation by raising borrowing costs and dampening demand — particularly for goods.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said, “With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March”. It is likely the first interest hike will come either in March or April, after the Fed completes tapering.\n\nHere is the entire statement: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf)\n\nIn his press conference following the meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said, “I would say that the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming conditions are appropriate for doing so.” \n\nBut the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee unanimously agreed that “it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,” and Powell’s commentary suggests the first increase will happen on March 16.\n\nKathy Entwistle, Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, said “Everything the Fed is doing at this point we think has just been priced in over the last few weeks. And that's where a lot of the slide in the market has come from. And the big question is, will we slide a little bit more? What's happening? We're looking at companies and their earnings ... to determine whether or not we're going to have a little bit more of a pullback in the market or not. And that's based on what they can do going forward, where their opportunities are. And we've been hearing a lot about inflation. If you think about a 7% inflation rate, that's quite significant.\" \n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Robinhood (HOOD) stock was extremely volatile today, dropping more than -14% in the morning after a disappointing earnings result before surging and closing the day almost +10% higher. Similar story happened with Affirm (AFRM).\n* In a new note, Bank of America economists said that they are expecting the Fed to [raise interest rates by 25 basis points seven times this year](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bank-america-says-it-expects-seven-fed-rate-hikes-this-year-2022-01-28/), representing one of the most hawkish predictions so far for the path forward for the central bank.\n* The University of Michigan's final January consumer sentiment index fell to 67.2, dipping from the preliminary estimate of 68.8 earlier in the month. This represented the lowest reading since November 2011. Subindices tracking both consumers' expectations for future conditions and assessments of present economic conditions each deteriorated during the month. \n* Personal income rose at a 0.3% month-on-month rate in December, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday, missing estimates for a 0.5% rise, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Income had risen 0.5% in November. Personal spending fell 0.6% during the month\n* Earlier in the week, Bill Ackman announced his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, now owns more than 3.1 million shares of Netflix (NFLX), worth roughly $1 billion. In the letter to investors Ackman praised the company's \"best-in-class management team\" and on Twitter the manager said he has long admired Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and the \"remarkable company he and his team have built.\"\n* Apple (AAPL) will reportedly allow iPhones to accept contactless payments, a moved that pressured stock in Block (SQ). \n* Oracle (ORCL) director Charles Moorman picked up $1.3 million worth of ORCL shares at an average price of $83.76.\n* Next week, Congress will hold a hearing to discuss self-driving vehicles. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will hold a hearing on Feb. 2 titled “The Road Ahead for Autonomous Vehicles”. \n\n\"Life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it.\" -*Charles Swindoll*",
