I came down with Covid on Thursday night,” Cramer said on “Squawk on the Street.” He added he’s been triple vaccinated: two shots of Moderna and a Moderna booster.\n\n&gt; “I know exactly how I got it,” he said. “I was at an event where you had to have PCR [tests].”\n&gt; \n&gt; “I got it that night from someone who was tested that day,” he said. “The problem is it works so fast. You can’t stop it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cramer said his wife is sicker than he is. “She had J&amp;J and Moderna,” he revealed, referring to the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine and a Moderna booster shot.\n\nHis investing advice?\n\n&gt;Shortly after making these comments, Cramer told his “CNBC Investing Club” that he’s buying more shares of Chevron on weakness for this charitable trust. “I am more sanguine than people who are selling,” he said on TV. “There are people who are panicking. I don’t like to sell panic. I like to buy panic.”\n\nCramer's experience is relevant to the market because like it or not, a lot of people follow his recommendations. If he comes through Omicron relatively unscathed, I think he's going to be very bullish and his audience will follow his lead. But if Cramer has a tough time with Omicron, then his audience is going to be more negative on the market. How do you think Cramer's infection may affect the market?\n\nI know he's not Reddit's favorite, but I wish him and his family a speedy recovery.",
