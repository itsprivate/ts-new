My total loss is 9.49% right now, but at least I'm selling some covered calls to make some premium. It's currently trading around $231 and I was thinking of maybe buying some more here to bring down my cost basis even further. If I didn't own PYPL at all right now, I'd be buying like crazy right now. But since I've already bought three times already averaging down, I'm not sure I should buy more again now. I'm only down about 4.4% from my last buy. If it got to -10% from my last buy, I would definitely buy more at that point. What are your thoughts on PYPL here and going forward over the next few months?",
