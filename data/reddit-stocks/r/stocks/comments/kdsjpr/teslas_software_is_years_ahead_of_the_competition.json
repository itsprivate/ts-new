He estimates  Tesla is three years ahead of other carmakers when it comes to advanced driver-assistance features. </p>\n\n<p>Loup Ventures estimates that Tesla will recognize $1.1 billion in deferred software revenue in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2022 from OTA updates, access to its Supercharger network, and, mainly, the adoption of &quot;full self driving.&quot; Customers have purchased the feature, but Tesla has not fully released it, so it hasn&#39;t yet recognized that revenue on its balance sheet.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
