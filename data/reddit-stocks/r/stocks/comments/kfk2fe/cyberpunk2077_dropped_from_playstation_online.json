Just take a look at their ticker today: WSE:CDR (Warsaw Stock Exchange)</p>\n\n<p>And for more insight on why the release was so disastrous:\n<a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-16-cyberpunk-2077-developers-were-updating-the-last-gen-version-until-the-very-last-minute\">https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-16-cyberpunk-2077-developers-were-updating-the-last-gen-version-until-the-very-last-minute</a></p>\n\n<p>IMO, the CEO is totally wrong to say that it&#39;s &quot;unfair&quot; to criticise the game as &quot;unplayable&quot;. Whilst yes, the game does indeed load at start up, having quest-giving necessary NPC&#39;s disappearing from the game is totally and utterly gamebreaking, potentially forcing players to (at worst) hard-reset their save files. And anyway, it&#39;s a given that consumers expect a working, functioning product from an established dev at $60-80+ a pop. No wonder they are demanding refunds!</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps CD Projekt Red would have been a great one to short :P</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
