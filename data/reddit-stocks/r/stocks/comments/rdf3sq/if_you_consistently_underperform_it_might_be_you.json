But I see so many posts on Reddit of people losing money--significant fractions of their net worth--and blaming everyone but themselves; I feel there are some young folks here who need to hear this. \n\nThe S&amp;P500 is up about 25% YTD--that's extremely rare. It's up 115% since the March 2020 low. Look yourself in a mirror, and ask yourself if you're going better than the market. \n\nThis is not addressed to Bogleheads--you guys are doing fine. It's not addressed to traders who've been around since the dot com era. This is not addressed to retirees who've been through all this many times before. This is addressed to the novice investors of Reddit who entered the market after Covid and whose performance is negative, during an amazing bull run. \n\nFinance is one of the most cut-throat fields in existence. You are competing with people who are vastly most experienced, wealthier, and more influential than you. Some of the smartest people in the world. It's certainly possible for someone with a small portfolio to outperform--but it's not a game. You need to take it seriously. It requires work, study, temperament. Just because you're young doesn't mean you can afford to set your finances back years. \n\nDo you know how to determine the fair value of a company? Do you know how risk-free yields influence that calculation? Do you actually do that calculation before deploying your capital? \n\nDo you try to predict the short-term direction of the market? Try to predict when the next crash will be? How's that been working for you? \n\nDon't blame others. The market is not rigged against you--that's no excuse when it has been so easy to make money. No one forced you to buy stock in a company that had negative earnings; it's up to you to consider a margin of safety. Some people have genuinely been dealt a rotten hand---but you can't blame others for wealth inequality if it was **your own bad decisions** that caused you to lose money. Learn from it. \n\nThe market won't always be like this. Since Covid the overall market has been on 'easy' mode. I don't pretend to be an expert investor, but I've been in the market since about 2005 and it's almost never this easy. As interest rates return to their historical levels and the effects of Covid become normalized, it will only get harder. Don't let your pride and arrogance get the better of you. \n\n**TL;DR:** Git gud, scrub.",
