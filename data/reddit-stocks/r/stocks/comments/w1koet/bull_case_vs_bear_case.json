Their balance sheet is also healthy.\n* No recession this year. A slowdown in growth appears certain, but not a recession. Given the recent decline, the market has more or less priced in the current situation.\n\n**Bear Case**\n\n* While there has been a good amount of damage done, markets are only \"fairly valued\" on forward EPS estimates that have not been revised down. \n* Commodities are still higher than pre-covid levels by a significant amount. Peak inflation doesn't mean we instantly go back to 2%. Inflation is sticky, and higher than 2% will have the Fed continue to raise rates. Inflation may slow to 4 or 5% which is still way too high. If they raise and pause rates like the 1970's bear market, it will be a volatile mess.\n* Jobs are a lagging indicator, and things can change quickly.\n* A strong consumer contributes to inflation, forcing the Fed to continue rate hikes until inflation is below 3% at the very least.\n* Until we know what earnings look like, we can't estimate how deep the growth decline will be. It's safer to wait until earnings + forward guidance at the very least.",
