More likely one year puts, tbh, as they have capped downside.\n\nNow I know that some of you EV fanboys out there think that there's something wrong with me in the head. But, as stupid as I am sometimes, I do think that nobody can ever justify the ridiculously bad fundamentals of RIVN. Sure, the company has enormous potential and might be a great supplier of EV pickup trucks around the globe, but that's all in the future 5+ years. However, I want to focus on 2022 right now.\n\nFundamentally speaking, the company is garbage right now. No earnings, so no P/E ratio. One million in total revenue with a $78 billion market cap; that's a 78,000 P/S ratio, which is absolutely ridiculous. Return on equity and assets are non-existent, so is cash flow. Rivian does have more assets than liabilities, but that's not saying much. I can't believe the company IPO'ed at $106 a share and people still bought in. Gambling mindset at its best.\n\nTechnically speaking, RIVN is down more than half (\\~50%) from ATH as of now, but I strongly believe it will halve again, and maybe again. There might be a few dead cat bounces along the way, but those cannot prevent the big picture of RIVN stock this year. The Fed's monetary tightening policies are not helping either.\n\n(FYI, TSLA IPO'ed with 93 million total revenue and a valuation of $1.7 billion. Now I know that the EV craze wasn't there yet when TSLA IPO'ed, but that still doesn't justify RIVN's fundamentals. 2020 and 2021 were the years when fundamentals didn't matter, but 2022 will be different.)\n\nThanks for hearing me out. Cheers.",
