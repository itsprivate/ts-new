Great for traders (I hope), but for new investors, maybe it was confusing, emotional, stressful, all of the above.  Volatility is going to happen... maybe not quite the way this week played out, but it happens.  A few weeks ago I made a post about factors to consider when buying a stock from an investor&#39;s perspective.  I thought it would be helpful to talk about some of the intangible qualities that we should strive towards as well.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Humility</strong>:  Being an investor requires humility.  It&#39;s hard not to compare yourselves to others, especially if you are on forums like reddit and you see people posting about gains.  <strong>Do not compare yourself to others</strong>.  Everyone&#39;s journey as an investor is different.  Everyone&#39;s perspectives are different, and we all have a different tolerance for risk.  We all have different life circumstances.  Some devote their day-to-day looking at stocks.  Others have to work consistent hours and days that prevent them from doing the same.  All that matters is that you are making decisions that you feel good about and that you are taking advantage of the markets in your own way.  Success in the markets should not be determined by those around you.  It&#39;s determined by the goals you set out for yourself.</li>\n<li><strong>Discipline</strong>: Emotions, emotions, emotions.  Every investor will tell you to take the emotions out of investing.  But it&#39;s so much easier said than done.  For newer investors, some of your earlier mistakes (like mine) will occur because of emotions.  When we see a stock shooting up, it&#39;s hard to fight the urge to join the hype.  Your emotions are telling you that you can easily double your money!  But, if you take the emotions out of the equation, would you have invested in the stock when considering your objective investing thesis?  It&#39;s important to create a plan and stick with it.  Your plan should be created based on industries you are familiar with or are willing to follow/learn more about.  <strong>Stay away from buying stocks that do not fall under your realm of competence.  This includes your knowledge of the industry as well as your lack of understanding of why/how a stock is moving.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Patience</strong>:  <strong>Your journey as an investor is a marathon, not a sprint</strong>.  Part of the beauty of investing is growing as a person.  You will see yourself becoming more well-rounded.  You will see yourself learning more about how the world works.  Don&#39;t worry about the day-to-day volatility, unless you see an incredible buying opportunity.  Always think big picture, both in terms of your outlook on the market as well as your personal growth.  In your 20, 30, 40+ years to go of investing, you will be encountered with thousands and thousands of opportunities. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Good luck everyone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
