Earnings are reported and they are great. This indicates the economy is heating up still and will probably result in JPOW raising rates faster. Stocks crash.\n3. Regardless of earnings, inflation hits 10% in 2022 and JPOW's hand is forced to pull a Paul Volcker and pump rates through the roof. Stocks crash.\n\nIt's clear that we only have bear catalysts for the next 1-3 months. So sell now, sure, feel like a genius. The only problem is when do you get back in? Is the bear market gonna last 10 years like the dot com bubble crash, or multi-decades like the Great Depression? Or will the bear market last 6 months and by the end of the year we will be back at ATH's due to retail now being smarter than they were in 1929. Retail has the internet now, they understand buy the dip mentality. They know the stock market always goes up overtime.\n\nMy bet? Don't do shit because I'm not going to stick glued to Bloomberg for 3 more months trying to keep up to date as to whats happening in the market. But that's cuz I'm only 26 and plan to hold my SPY and VTI for 30 more years (probably forever since I'll just live off of dividends and covered call income when I retire early).\n\nAm I stupid for remaining bullish? Idk, but you all are probably gonna get f'ed trying to time the market.\n\nJust think of the guy who sold everything at the start of the Covid crash and ppl thought he was a genius, but then he missed out on 50% - 80% profits from where he was before the crash just cuz he thought it was a dead cat bounce and couldn't time his re-entry.",
