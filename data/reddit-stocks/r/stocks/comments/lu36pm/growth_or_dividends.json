I&#39;ve been building mainly a portfolio based on high yields stocks and ETFs. However, I recently read that the market tends to grow 10% per year in average. Would that mean that for me to build a dividends portfolio that keeps up with the Market I&#39;d have to have an average 10% yield across the whole thing? Should I start getting more into Index ETFs or are dividend stocks a good way to play the game?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
