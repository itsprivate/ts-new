Amwell has positioned itself as a leading performer in the healthcare industry, having quickly become one of the biggest players in telehealth. It connects healthcare providers, including mental health practitioners, to patients over secure video - giving people access to healthcare from virtually anywhere. For obvious reasons, this has been especially necessary in 2020. Despite a recent IPO, the company already has a market cap of about $6.53 billion.</p>\n\n<p>AMWL was founded in 2006 and has grown exponentially over the last 15 years. Though the pandemic definitely gave it a large boost, it’s not going anywhere once it&#39;s over. It seems like the pandemic was the final push for healthcare providers who were holding out on telehealth to finally get it on the action; it was no longer an option for them. Widespread vaccination won&#39;t eliminate the necessity for telehealth as a service--much less the demand. Many people are now treating telemedicine as their first choice care option. In fact, in a recent survey, 62% of telehealth patients said they’d continue to have virtual visits with their mental health providers once the pandemic ends. The company is expanding at a significant rate since the start of the pandemic and is quickly expanding its services, growing its network of doctors and working with more insurance companies. </p>\n\n<p>For the more technical folks who like to see hard numbers: AMWL has a YoY revenue growth of 80% to $62.6 million and had total doctor visits of more than 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 450% compared to the same time in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Google invested $100 million into AMWL. To me this is not only a strong indicator of viability, it&#39;s a virtual guarantee that they will have the resources necessary to execute on their growth strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to last year, the total number of providers increased 930% percent from just 6,000 to 62,000 - allowing more patients to receive care while increasing specialties provided; as the network expands, the value of the network grows.</p>\n\n<p>$AMWL reported revenue of $114 million in 2018 and $149 million in 2019, an increase of about 31%. The company projects revenue to be between $235 million and $239 million for 2020 (I will try to remember to update this once these numbers are announced). </p>\n\n<p>In addition to a major partnership with Cleveland Clinic, AMWL recently announced the introduction of 3 brand new products designed to reach a bigger audience: Amwell Now, Touchpoint Tablet software and C500.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s clear that AMWL is growing at an incredible pace as evident by the YoY revenue, network size, and patient growth in the past 1-2 years and will continue to grow into the foreseeable future. As the company’s provider network and insurance company network continues to grow, so does its efficiency at attracting new patients in a broader range.</p>\n\n<p>TDLR; AMWL: Good company to invest in, great future prospects, incredible revenue, patient, and healthcare provider network growth, as well as substantial new product offerings and joint ventures. As always, do your own DD but in my opinion, with AMWL still trading below $35, it&#39;s not one to miss out on.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
