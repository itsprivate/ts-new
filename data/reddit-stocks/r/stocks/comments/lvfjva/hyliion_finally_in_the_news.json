I needed this.</p>\n\n<p>To anyone interested, they&#39;re providing a fully EV semi and it&#39;s recharged onboard via renewable sourced natural gas.  It&#39;s got a longer range, better cost efficiency, and higher payload tolerance than diesel and all other EVs currently on the market.  The battery charges in less than 8 mins.  Production starts this year for early adopters and full production next year.  Unit is cost competitive with current diesel models.</p>\n\n<p>Look into it, let me know what you think.  Always love feedback, DD.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been holding for a while now, been pretty flat for me but I had the company valued at $220 in 10 years with a EV of 30B in the same time with a market share of 20% and a EBITDA multiplier of 15x (common in this market).  Conservative estimates in my opinion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
