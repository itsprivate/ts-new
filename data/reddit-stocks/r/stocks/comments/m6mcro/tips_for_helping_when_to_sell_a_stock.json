So far my portfolio is up about 5 percent, however recently there have been 2 opportunities where I could have sold a stock at a much higher price after it went up insane amounts in 1 day. </p>\n\n<p>These particular instances were $RKT (owned shares at 20.90) which went up to 43$ and $CHEK (owned shares at 1.70) which went up 180 percent in 1 day from 1.53$ to 4.30$. I didn&#39;t sell my shares in either of these instances (let&#39;s be honest I got greedy) and both have significantly dropped since (still up on both positions). </p>\n\n<p>My question is how do you guys deal with situations like this? When do you take profits? If I had sold off my shares in both instances I could have been up about 20 percent in total. I am aware thinking why didn&#39;t I get out at the top in hindsight is a toxic mindset but I am looking to improve my abilities as an investor so therefore I am here asking you kind people for advice. Thanks in advance :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
