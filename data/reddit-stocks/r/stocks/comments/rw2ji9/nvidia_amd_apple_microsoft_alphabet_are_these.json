From what I read on the internet, market sentiment is largely positive towards those companies.\n\nI am not adding Tesla to this list because I'm not really confident that their growth last year was organic. Maybe I should add Facebook at least?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nForgot to mention that I want to put 50% of that amount into ***leveraged shares*** (3x) of the said companies. I do understand that if the underlying stock goes down by 33.3% in one day,  I'm basically done. But 33.3% down for companies of such caliber in a SINGLE day would be probably happening alongside a total market crash, no?",
