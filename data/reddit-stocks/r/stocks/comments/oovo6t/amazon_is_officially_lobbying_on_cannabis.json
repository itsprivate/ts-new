Early Wednesday morning, ​Amazon.com Services LLC [registered](https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/532894c6-bc65-4e48-b7e9-8c2747fa5426/print/) to lobby, among other topics, on: “Issues related to the Equality Act (H.R. 5 / S. 393), the Justice in Policing Act (H.R. 1280), and marijuana reform, including the MORE Act of 2021 (H.R. 3617).”\n\nThe MORE Act was reintroduced in Congress in May, as [*Cannabis Wire* recently reported](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/05/28/more-act-bill-to-end-the-federal-criminalization-of-cannabis-reintroduced-in-congress/). The House passed the previous version of the Act in late 2020, as [*Cannabis Wire* reported at the time](https://cannabiswire.com/2020/12/04/in-historic-vote-us-house-passes-more-act-to-end-the-federal-criminalization-of-cannabis/).  \n\nCannabis reform advocates have largely shifted their energy toward the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA), announced this month by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden. While both MORE and CAOA would end the federal criminalization of cannabis by removing it from the federal Controlled Substances Act, MORE offers little else in the way of regulation. Conversely, as *Cannabis Wire* [recently reported](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/07/14/sens-schumer-wyden-and-booker-release-most-comprehensive-cannabis-reform-proposal-yet-here-are-the-details/), CAOA is the most comprehensive cannabis reform proposal to-date in Congress. The Senators have also taken the unprecedented approach of releasing a discussion draft of their bill, which provides specific regulatory details, ahead of drafting the final legislation.\n\n*Cannabis Wire* has reached out to Amazon to learn more about its lobbying priorities related to cannabis, and will update the story accordingly.\n\n[https://cannabiswire.com/2021/07/21/amazon-is-officially-lobbying-on-cannabis/](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/07/21/amazon-is-officially-lobbying-on-cannabis/)",
