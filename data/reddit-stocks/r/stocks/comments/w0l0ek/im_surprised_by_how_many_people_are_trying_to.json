Yes you can wait, and maybe it'll go lower, but will you buy then? How exactly have you defined an acceptable \"bottom\" to start buying in at? Waiting for the \"vibe\" to feel right feels risky to me, because once those signs are clear I'd anticipate stocks to rise relatively rapidly. Yeah you can buy in on an upswing, but you're just as likely to sit there and think \"nah this isn't it\", or come in late and miss out on a 5-10% gain (which is substantial when you're sitting on like 50-100k)\n\nI feel like if you have a large cash position right now you already won. You didn't buy into the peak, the markets down substantially, why wait? How do you see this going for yourself? I'd take the win",
