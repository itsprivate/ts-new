Apologies*\n\nAfter being negative through most of the day, the three major indexes reversed in the last hour of the market in order to snap a five-day consecutive losing streak, the longest since February. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.25% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed even while the Dow Jones (DIA) broke its recent streak of relative underperformance to close 0.74% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 0.58% higher. \n\nLast week, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. \n\nMike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, “Anyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this won’t be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind we’re still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.”\n\nIn positive news, there are signs that the wave of coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US may be cresting. The seven-day average of daily Covid cases is about 144,300 as of Sept. 12, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That figure is down 12% over the past week and 14% from the most recent peak in case counts on Sept. 1, when the country was reporting an average of roughly 167,600 cases per day. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University said, This is good news. It could represent that we have reached a peak and we are now on the way down.”  As of Sept 12, 54.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 63.8% have received at least one dose of either Pfizer (PFE) or Moderna (MRNA). \n\nShares of Chinese companies were broadly lower again as the regulatory crackdown by the CCP continues. According to a report by the Financial Times, the CCP intends to break up Alipay, the financial super-app owned by Jack Ma’s Ant Group that has more than $1 billion users, and force the creation of a new entity for the company’s lending unit. The plan will also see Ant turn over user data that underpins its data decision to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned.[ https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79](https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79)\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are closely eyeing new reports on inflation and consumer spending set to be released next week. The former will be monitored to signal whether upward price pressures during the recovery have extended further and whether the Federal Reserve may need to step in sooner rather than later to stave off a lasting jump in inflation. Consensus economists expect Tuesday's consumer price index (CPI) to rise by 5.3% in August over last year, pulling back from July's more than a decade-high annual rise of 5.4%. \n\nThe new data on August retail sales out from the Commerce Department later this week will also offer a look at how consumer spending has held up amid concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices. Overall retail sales are expected to drop by 0.8% in August in Thursday's report, extending July's 1.1% decline. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* House Democrats released details of a plan that intends to help pay for the $3.5 trillion 2021 spending bill currently in consideration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., on Monday released details of plan that includes increasing the top corporate tax rate to 26.5%, up from the current rate of 21%, and restoring the top rate to 39.6% for individuals earning over $400,000 and married couples earning over $450,000. In order for the bill to pass and avoid the filibuster, Democrats are using special budget rules but need all 50 Democratic Senators and virtually all other House Democrats to agree. \n* In more news coming out of China, regulators ordered the largest internet companies to stop blocking links from rivals on their apps, another step designed to increase competition among tech companies. Authorities have made the move against blocking external links a key focus of a campaign that started in July, after receiving multiple complaints from users, an official with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said.\n* Last week, a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apple’s 15-30% commission. This is massive for companies that make a lot of their revenue through the app store.\n* A cyber surveillance company based in Israel has developed a tool than can break into Apple iPhones with a never-before-seen technique for at least six months, internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday. The discovery is important because of the critical nature of the vulnerability, which affects all versions of Apple's iOS, OSX, and watchOS. Apple confirmed the vulnerability and said the issue has been fixed in today’s software update. \n* ViacomCBS (VIAC) will be restructuring Paramount Pictures amid a broader management shake-up, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. The realignment will see Paramount focus primarily on making content for sister cable and streaming networks. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Affirm (AFRM) target raised by Barclays from $115 to $140 at Overweight. Stock currently around $109\n* Albemarle (ALB) with a host of target raises. Average price target $280 at Buy. Stock currently around $229\n* Asana (ASAN) target raised by Jefferies from $90 to $115 at Buy. Stock currently around $101\n* AutoZone (AZO) target raised by Wells Fargo from $1700 to $1750 at Overweight. Stock currently around $1554\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Goldman Sachs from $515 to $535 at Buy. Stock currently around $476\n* Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) target raised by Stephens from $600 to $700 at Overweight. Stock currently around $580\n\n“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” - Aristotle",
