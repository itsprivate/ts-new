I have no position in this ticker what so ever, including short.\n\nI saw the Tweet from the official  PSWW Twitter account on July 1st in regards to the eTruck acquisition  and was pretty excited, until my deep dive occurred. There is a lot of  mystery behind this company that started fundraising for a facility in  2013 but does not currently have one on file. Russel Knudsen is the  listed President of eTruck but who is he and why did PSWW block me on  Twitter for asking about this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\neTruck  tried to fundraise $500,000 in 2013 for a facility and patent fees.  What happened? Where is the facility and the patents for this \"ground  breaking\" technology?\n\nThey stated they their Chief Engineer is one of the top in the world but, who is it?\n\nPSWW listed office address is... a Wealth Management Company? Phone number straight to voicemail and it's full?\n\nWhat does Russell Knudsen REALLY do as a job, it's actually surprising.\n\nExecutive Assistant to the CEO of $PSWW posts on... StockTwits?!\n\nSee bullet proof evidence and sources below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImage  to the facility in the video PSWW is implying will be the location of  the facility, beautiful. As it was announced as a \"New Manufacturing  Facility\" it made me think there must be a preexisting one? Not that I  could find.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn  fact, during my deep dive over this facility I found some disturbing  revelations. I first found the eTruck registered address on the  OpenCorporates website. Also note the Agent Name/Directors/Officers at  the bottom.\n\n[https://opencorporates.com/companies/us\\_ne/10162308](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ne/10162308)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis address as shown on Google maps in the image below. 810 Skyline Drive, Elkhorn. 68022, a residential property.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think to myself, maybe I just need to look at the Agent Name to find the address.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n20680 Roundup Circle, Elkhorn, another residential property.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting  enough, Judith once lived here but has not lived here since 2019  meanwhile Russell has not been associated with this address since 2011,  pre eTruck launch.\n\n[https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/find/person/plu40lru2600692r4n69](https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/find/person/plu40lru2600692r4n69)\n\n[https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/find/person/px62un84l0n0l624n2ll6](https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/find/person/px62un84l0n0l624n2ll6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis  brings the question of, does eTruck actually exist?! Where is the  website? Where is the facility? Where are the patents? The only thing on  file I could find was a trademark for their logo in 2013. In the  presentation they note their Chief Engineer is one of the top in the  world but I cannot find them. They have raised funds since 2013 but do  not have patents, a facility nor even a website.\n\nAlso  claimed to have 2,000 orders with a $25,000 margin in 2013, what  happened? $50 million dollars that just never happened? But the Tweet by  PSWW stated they have capicity for 6 trucks in the preexisting  facility?\n\nLink, also lists Russell Knudsen as President:\n\n[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/etruck](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/etruck)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe  most damning piece of evidence in my opinion is Russel Knudsens  ownership of Knudsen Automotive Inc, a body repair and paint shop. You  heard that right, he is not even an automotive mechanic but instead is a  BODY REPAIR AND PAINT professional.\n\nLink: [https://nebraska.repair-auto.org/273696-knudsen\\_automotive\\_inc.htm](https://nebraska.repair-auto.org/273696-knudsen_automotive_inc.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother  crazy part, the truepeoplesearch link I shared for Russell Knudsen  earlier does not even have an actual address listed as his current  address but instead a P.O. Box which is also the same P.O. Box that is  listed as the mailing address for Knudsen Automotive Inc.\n\nP.O.  Box is also registered to another business Russell Knudsen used to run,  a financial consulting business that seemed to have issue with paying  taxes.\n\n[https://www.nebraska.gov/sos/corp/corpsearch.cgi](https://www.nebraska.gov/sos/corp/corpsearch.cgi)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPO Box linked to Knudson Automotive Inc and Russell Knudsen current address\n\n[http://www.siclists.com/nebraska/omaha/Knudsen-Automotive-Inc\\_1m9xX.html](http://www.siclists.com/nebraska/omaha/Knudsen-Automotive-Inc_1m9xX.html)\n\nBonus DD on $PSWW themselves.\n\nThe  address for the company according to Google and SEC filings, is a firm  called \"Constant Wealth Management\", no known office. Listed phone  number in SEC filings and Google go straight to voicemail and the  mailbox is full. See for yourselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCEO  has many aliases, Kenrick Toussaint, Bryce Toussaint, Rick Toussaint,  K. Bryce Toussaint, Kenrick Bryce Toussaint and I'm sure more I could  not find.\n\nCEO also seems to have a  past history with a lot of OTC companies, MDVL, Myos Rens Technology  Inc , Principal Solar Inc, China Xiangtai Food Co Ltd, Swordfish  Financial Inc (OTCMKTS:SWRF), GWHP, TRIG etc... Hard to find them all  with so many aliases\n\nSeems to be a  trend of the CEO to join a company board/take over as CEO, gets shares,  stays listed on the board for about 2 years, cashes out and on to the  next one. Walks like a duck, looks like a duck and acts like a duck...\n\nHis  assistant, Lindsey Harastas \"Executive Assistant to the CEO and CFO at  Principal Solar, INC\" also has a entry on their LinkedIn stating they  have been a professional options trader for the past 9 years and is also  active on StockTwits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLindsey  actively posts on StockTwits acknowledging comments praising the  company and positive news articles, unethical at best and illegal at  worst. Especially if she holds shares in the company that are not  reported to the SEC properly.\n\nShe  also has not posted often but made a personal post and liked about 5-6  others on the $PSWW board on 7/20/21, the day they released news but did  not see a price increase as I was bearish on that board the last two  weeks while collecting DD. Her last post was February 21, 2021. Had no  idea she posted on there or liked tweets relevant to me towards the end  of my DD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry  the bashers are not educated with the same level of insider information  as you, Lindsey. Why so emotional though? Hopefully you don't own  shares of the company you have inside information to that are not  reported to the SEC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nI asked PSWW about Russel Knudsen on Twitter in which they promptly blocked me, so I chose to investigate further.\n\n2nd one down\n\n&#x200B;\n\neTruck has \"existed\" for 13 years with no website, facility or patents although they attempted to fundraise $500,000 8 years ago\n\nRussell Knudsen, President of eTruck is a 77 year old who appears to be a retired autobody and paint specialist.\n\nHe is the listed President of eTruck but it is not listed he is actual associated businesses in any officials businesses\n\nListed addresses found for eTruck are resdential properties\n\nRussell Knudsen is also tied to Knudsen & Associates and according to the company files they had issue with paying taxes\n\nCEO of $PSWW has at least 5 aliases and has been involved with at least 8 OTC tickers throughout his career\n\nHis executive assistant is also a professional options trader and praises the company on StockTwits\n\nCOO  is also listed as a professional trader on LinkedIn, only 3 relevant  employees I can seem to find. The board of executives is soley made up  of Kenrick Toussaint and Anthony Lerner. You would think the 3rd person  with the most insider information would be the CEOs personal assistant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFact:  One of two scenarios is true, $PSWW leadership did not do any DD on  this acquisition OR, they did their DD and did not care because the  acquisition would be great for pumping the ticker price.\n\nPersonal  Opinion: To me it appears that CEO Kenrick works with a lot of OTC  companies for a short period for shares and leaves. In the case of  $PSWW, it almost seems like they are going for any flashy licensing deal  that is potentially relevant to todays market climate to increase the  stock price before cashing out. EV deal after EV deal, a VR deal. Bold  claims such as 8xing their oil well count from 15 to over 100 in the  next year. Quantity over quality.\n\nBe careful what you invest in, do your own DD and BE CAREFUL of OTC pump and dumps, especially on social medias like Twitter.",
