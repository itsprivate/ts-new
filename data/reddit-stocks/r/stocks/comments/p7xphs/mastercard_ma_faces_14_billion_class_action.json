The fees in question are paid by retailers to card-issuing companies when consumers use their cards to shop. The class action suit has been brought on behalf of all individuals over 16 years of age who bought goods and services from UK businesses via Mastercard in the specified period.\n\nThe CAT has not, however, included Merrick’s claim for compound interest and claims from the estates of consumers who died between 1992 and 2008 in the case. According to Mastercard, this reduced the claim’s size to around £10 billion from the initial £15 billion. The company is hopeful that further proceedings will cut the overall claim even more.\n\n“*The decision reduces the value of this spurious claim by more than 35%. Mastercard is confident that over the coming months a review of key facts will further significantly reduce the size and viability of the claim,*” the company said in a statement.\n\nMerricks said the CAT ruling “*heralds the start of an era of consumer-focused class actions which will help to hold big business to account in areas that really matter.*”\n\nNo date has been set for the trial yet. Previously, the European Commission ruled that Mastercard interchange fees violated the EU’s competition law in 2007.\n\n[https://www.rt.com/business/532471-mastercard-class-action-lawsuit-uk/](https://www.rt.com/business/532471-mastercard-class-action-lawsuit-uk/)",
