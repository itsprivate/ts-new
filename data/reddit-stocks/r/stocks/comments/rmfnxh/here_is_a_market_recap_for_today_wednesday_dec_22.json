  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 22, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mostly higher on Wednesday, with all three major indexes extending yesterday’s gains, as market participants digested FDA approval of a Pfizer’s (PFE) oral coronavirus treatment and new reports about US gross-domestic product (GDP) and consumer confidence.\n\n**Notable Numbers**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.00%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.22%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.71%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.99%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.77%\n* Tesla (TSLA): +7.49%\n* Alibaba (BABA): -4.07%\n* AMC: -5.35%\n\nPfizer’s antiviral COVID-19 pill for at-risk people aged 12 and above was authorized by the FDA , making it the first oral treatment which can be taken at home, providing a potentially important tool in the fight against the fast-spreading Omicron variant.\n\nThe pill, called Paxlovid, was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to data from the company's clinical trial. Recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against Omicron, Pfizer said.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-oral-covid-19-pill-gets-us-authorization-at-home-use-2021-12-22/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-oral-covid-19-pill-gets-us-authorization-at-home-use-2021-12-22/)\n\nOmicron has overtaken other coronavirus variants to become the dominant strain in the U.S., and now accounts for about three-quarters of new infections, according to the CDC. To fight this, the Biden administration announced it was buying 500 million at-home rapid coronavirus tests that Amercians will be able to order online for free starting in January.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/cdc-omicron-accounted-73-recent-230445514.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/cdc-omicron-accounted-73-recent-230445514.html)\n\nIn the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was revised higher. Analysts now expect GDP to show a 2.3% annualized increase in economic activity in Q3, up from the 2.1% rise previously estimated.\n\nThe Conference Board’s highly anticipated Consumer Confidence Index report showed a greater than expected increase in December. The institution's headline index crept higher to 115.8 in December, based on the latest release. This was above the 111.0 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.\n\nLynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said “Consumer confidence improved further in December, following a very modest gain in November. Expectations about short-term growth prospects improved, setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, major appliances, and vacations over the next six months all increased.”\n\nShe continued, “Meanwhile, concerns about inflation declined after hitting a 13-year high last month as did concerns about COVID-19, despite reports of continued price increases and the emergence of the Omicron variant,\" Franco added. Looking ahead to 2022, both confidence and consumer spending will continue to face headwinds from rising prices and an expected winter surge of the pandemic.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Existing home sales increased by 1.9% to reach a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 6.46 million units in November, [the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/existing-home-sales-november-2021-150006550.html) Consensus economists were looking for a 2.9% increase, according to Bloomberg data. Existing home sales in October had risen at a 0.8% monthly rate.\n* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he has ‘sold enough’ stock.\n* shares fell Wednesday following reports that China’s IT regulator suspended partnership with the company for six months for failing to report an open-source security vulnerability to the government.\n* Nio announced that it received the U.N. certification on cybersecurity management, which is a major global mandatory regulation with regards to cybersecurity. It is widely applicable in countries such as the EU, the U.K., Japan and South Korea.\n* The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied Apple Inc's bid to exclude a shareholder proposal that would require the company to inform investors about its use of non-disclosure agreements and other concealment clauses, according to a document viewed by Reuters.\n\n“The greatest glory in living lies not in never failing, but in rising everytime we fall.” - Nelson Mandela",
