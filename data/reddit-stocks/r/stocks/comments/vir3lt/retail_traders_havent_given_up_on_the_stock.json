This in turn may suggest that a full-on market “capitulation” might still lie ahead, even as U.S. stocks extended a rebound on Wednesday from last week’s slump.\n\nAnalysts at Vanda Research led by Marco Iachini said in a weekly research note that while retail interest in U.S. stocks reached its lowest level of the year so far on Tuesday, they still haven’t reached levels of “capitulation” on par with what was witnessed before stocks turned around in December 2018 and March 2020.\n\nWhat might retail capitulation look like? The Vanda team said that during the last two major selloffs in 2020 and late 2018, total “capitulation” didn’t arrive until retail traders had become net sellers of stocks. Using a pair of charts, the Vanda team showed that retail investors became net sellers of stocks for at least a few sessions just before the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, -0.13% began to rebound in both 2018 and 2020.\n\nTo be sure, retail investors are a much bigger force in markets today than they were four years ago, as average daily trading activity by small-time traders has increased substantially, according to flows data collected by Vanda from several of the most popular discount brokerages used by retail traders, including Charles Schwab SCHW, +0.10%, TD Ameritrade and others.\n\nAnd retail interest isn’t the only measure of market “capitulation”, a term that represents signs of exhaustion that typically emerge before stocks bottom out. For example, when it comes to popular market-based measures of capitulation, it’s worth noting that the CBOE Volatility Index, the Wall Street “fear gauge” that reflects expectations for market volatility over the coming 30 days based on activity in options markets, has yet to flash its most closely watched exhaustion signal.\n\nAs MarketWatch pointed out in a story from May, investors typically associate a reading above “40” on the VIX with capitulation. The gauge topped out above 80 in November 2008 and again in March 2020. But it has yet to cross this threshold so far this year. Then again, every selloff is different. During the selloff in March 2020, the S&amp;P 500 fell 34% in just 23 trading days. This year’s selloff has been drawn out over a much longer period with the S&amp;P 500 falling more than 20% over a span of almost six months. Still, U.S. stocks appear headed for the worst first-half performance since 1932, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\n**To read the full story and to view charts-** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-u-s-stocks-rebound-analysts-warn-signs-of-genuine-capitulation-remain-elusive-11655922860?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-u-s-stocks-rebound-analysts-warn-signs-of-genuine-capitulation-remain-elusive-11655922860?mod=home-page)",
