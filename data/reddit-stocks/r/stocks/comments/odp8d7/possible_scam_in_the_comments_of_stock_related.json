  "selftext": " So I was watching youtube videos about stock market crashes and on one particular video found something that peeked my interest and got me doing some investigative work.\n\nThere were two comment threads by different accounts that were almost exact copies to each other and in both of them it ended with a person asking for a financial advisor. And both threads recommended the same financial advisor.\n\nIf you want to see the comments, here are screenshots:  \n[https://gyazo.com/5aac77d78ba8a42cab46a7d72358b947](https://gyazo.com/5aac77d78ba8a42cab46a7d72358b947)  \n[https://gyazo.com/d15510728c3ce438ddc9e991c6b8f180](https://gyazo.com/d15510728c3ce438ddc9e991c6b8f180)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How the comment thread goes:**\n\n* The original comment and the first and second reply follow the exact same script\n* The third reply is saying to get professional advice from a financial advisor and they end telling how successful they've been\n* Fourth reply asking for the third commenters financial advisor\n* The fifth reply is \"third reply guy\" telling them the name of the advisor and to go to their website\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I google the name of the financial advisor:**\n\n* First link is brokercheck.finra (a place to find if a person is a registered to sell securities). Everything seems to be in order at least to my untrained eye.\n* Second is her website. Her website is very simple, only a single page, but looks professionally made. Seems pretty legit to me on first look. Even includes pictures of her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Few things I found weird that makes me think it's a scam:**\n\n* I can't find any other source that this person exists. No social media or anything else that would prove her existence.\n* On her website and brokercheck.finra it says she has worked for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated since 1998, but on Merill Lynch's site ([www.ml.com](https://www.ml.com/)) you can't find her in their \"Find an advisor\" search.\n* The comments promoting her, all the commenters are quite new accounts and have been made the same day or the day before each other. (They look like bought/bot accounts to me)\n* Her website domain is very new and registrated only 6 months ago ([https://www.urlvoid.com/scan/jenniferlynnfranciosa.com/](https://www.urlvoid.com/scan/jenniferlynnfranciosa.com/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm not a financial advisor nor is this financial advice, just found something that in my eye looks like a scam. I don't know what's the key takeaway from this, maybe to not trust everything you see on the internet as it may not be a real person commenting and might just be made up entirely.",
