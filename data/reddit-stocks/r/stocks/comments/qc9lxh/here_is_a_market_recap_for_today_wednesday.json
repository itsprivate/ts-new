  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 20, 2021**\n\n***Quick rant:*** *It’s remarkable how quickly market sentiment changes. It seems two weeks ago, everyone was predicting an imminent market crash and, in many occasions, going as far as insulting my intelligence for presenting a different viewpoint and remaining bullish even during the height of the Evergrande situation and a looming US debt default. Now it seems the doomsaying posts and articles have all but disappeared. The market has dipped significantly roughly 5-6 times this year and every time it happens I see the same upswell of doomsaying articles and market crash predictors. Not to go on a rant, but it amazes me how willing people are to fight against the trend. Like I’ve said, it is important to acknowledge risks present in the market and be prepared to react to the unforeseen, but I don’t get why people decide to consciously decide to fight market trends, it is much easier and more profitable to just ride them until you can’t anymore. There’s a saying that goes, pessimists sound smart, optimists make money. I have found this saying to be true.* \n\nThe incredible rally in the stock market continued, with the S&P 500 (SPY) climbing seven straight days to claw back the losses suffered in September when the index dipped -5% from highs for the first time all year. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly today, the index has rocketed more than 6% higher from the lows on October 4, a stunning comeback. The Dow Jones (DIA) reached a new intraday all-time high, carried by continued strength in financial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, traded modestly higher today. Market participants remain encouraged by stronger-than-expected corporate profits amid ongoing supply-chain pressures.\n\nVery strong corporate earnings reports from bellwethers like big banks, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), and Procter and Gamble (PG) have assuaged fears that corporate profits would slow down dramatically amid supply chain constraints. As the earnings season kicked off, market participants were nervous that ongoing inflationary pressures, labor market imbalances, and congestions issues at ports would greatly weigh on corporate profits. So far, that has not proven to be the case. \n\nJon Adams, Senior Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets said, “We think investorshave been too pessimistic on earnings expectations. It does look like Q2 was likely the peak, but Q3 is going to be strong, probably above 30% year-over-year growth. We think the strength will continue into the fourth quarter, we’re not overly concerned about profit margins. We are closely monitoring supply chain issues and increasing wage pressures but still think that profit margins are at healthy levels, and that there's more upside to come.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The price of … reached new all-time highs, breaking $65k for the first time after the first-ever ETF was launched in the market yesterday.\n* Sharers of Pinterest (PINS) rocketed higher after Bloomberg reported that PayPal (PYPL) was considering acquiring the company for $70 a share (roughly $39 billion). Shares of PINS were up more than 10% while shares of PYPL fell after the report was released.\n* Adobe (ADBE) says it expects holiday-period online sales to reach an all-time high of $207 billion from November 1 to December 31 in the US. That would represent a jump of 10% YoY. The company says it expects global online sales to reach $910 billion, also a record.\n* The 30-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 3.23% for the week ended Oct. 15, according to a weekly update from the Mortgage Bankers Association. This is the highest level in six months and higher than the 3.18% during the prior week. \n* Facebook (FB) will change its name in order to reflect itself as a “metaverse” company. As a reminder, the metaverse is a shared, 3D virtual space in which people can interact with the environment and other via online avatars accessed using virtual reality technology.\n* Jack MA, founder of Alibaba (BABA) was seen traveling in Europe, specifically Spain, in the first overseas trip since the government began cracking down on his companies over a year ago. \n* DraftKings (DKNG) is launching online betting operations in Connecticut\n* Ford Motors (F) to invest $300 million in building an electric vehicle car parts factory in the UK\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Amazon (AMZN) target set at $4,100 by Mizuho.
