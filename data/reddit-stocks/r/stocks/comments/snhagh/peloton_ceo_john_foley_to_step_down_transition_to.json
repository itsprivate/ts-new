As of Monday, the stock is down about 31% year to date.\n\n&gt; The news of Foley stepping down comes ahead of Peloton’s fiscal second-quarter results, which are set to come after the market closes on Tuesday.\n\n&gt; Peloton told the Journal it expects to cut roughly $800 million in annual costs and reduce capital expenditures by roughly $150 million this year.\n\n&gt; The company also said in the report that it plans to wind down the development of its Peloton Output Park, the $400 million factory that it was building in Ohio. It said it will reduce its delivery teams and the amount of warehouse space it owns and operates.\n\n&gt; William Lynch, Peloton’s president, is also expected to step down from his executive role but remain on the board, Foley said in an interview with the Journal. Erik Blachford, a director since 2015, is expected to leave the board. And two new directors will be added, the Journal said: Angel Mendez, who runs a private artificial intelligence company focused on supply chain management; and Jonathan Mildenhall, former chief marketing officer of Airbnb.\n\n&gt; Roughly a week ago, activist Blackwells Capital — which has a less than 5% stake in the company — sent a letter to Peloton’s board urging Foley to quit his role as CEO, and asking the company to consider selling itself.\n\n&gt; Reports have since circulated that potential suitors could include Amazon or Nike. However, Foley along with other Peloton insiders had a combined voting control of roughly 80% as of Sept. 30, which would make it practically impossible for any deal to go through without their approval.\n\n&gt; Foley, 51, founded Peloton in 2012. He previously served as the president at Barnes &amp; Noble.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/peloton-ceo-john-foley-to-step-down-transition-to-executive-chair-as-company-cuts-2800-jobs-says-report.html",
