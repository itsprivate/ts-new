I posted <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/khdoae/what_are_your_guaranteed_growth_stock_buys_for/\">here</a> about stock recommendations for the future and tried to look more like a beginner. Not saying 5 years means I am an expert or hella knowledgeable, but I know what I am doing.</p>\n\n<p>The experiment was to let <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> decide what a new portfolio will look like and later compare it to 2 of my own portfolios that work independently. Every mention of a stock to buy received a vote in the portfolio, multiple mentions means multiple votes and the total of 100% is split across them based on their votes. Note that some comments could not be added due to availability and others were added due to frequent recommendations on other posts that asked for future growth stocks. The portfolio is meant for the future, meaning nothing that is liquidated in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Before I posted I expected trolls and a large tendency to TSLA, PLTR, PYPL, MSF, AAPL. Not because I think those are straight up good (also not saying they are bad), but I looked around before I decided to do this and those were quite common to be mentioned. Reality looked different.</p>\n\n<p>The 2 portfolios <a href=\"/r/stock\">r/stock</a>-portfolio will compete against (these have been running since early to mid December so they have a time advantage, which over the course of a year should barely make a difference):</p>\n\n<p><sup>\\</sup>Note: These are longterm portfolios. This doesn&#39;t mean that anything you don&#39;t see here I think of bad or not worthy to invest in, but they are rather in short term portfolios not associated to this experiment.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>First portfolio:</strong></p>\n\n<p>DIS, FB, BABA, LOW, ADBE, SPOT, NEM, SONO, BJ, NLS</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second portfolio:</strong></p>\n\n<p>DIS, EZJ, GSK, NG, GE, CINE, LLOY, IAG, UAA, PYPL, AZN, FDX, RR, TWLO, IIPR, XPEV, PLTR, BTCE, ABNB</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> <strong>portfolio</strong> (I will not use the stock abbreviation because I would need to look up a majority of these):</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft 5.5%</p>\n\n<p>Visa 4.5%</p>\n\n<p>CrowdStrike 4.5%</p>\n\n<p>Sea Limited 4.5%</p>\n\n<p>Palo Alto Networks 4.5%</p>\n\n<p>Walt Disney 3%</p>\n\n<p>Tesla: 3%</p>\n\n<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson: 3%</p>\n\n<p>Cloudflare: 3%</p>\n\n<p>Uber Technologies: 3%</p>\n\n<p>NIO Inc: 3%</p>\n\n<p>Lockhead Martin: 3%</p>\n\n<p>Square: 3%</p>\n\n<p>Apple: 3%</p>\n\n<p>Palantir: 3%</p>\n\n<p>Amazon: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Reality Income: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>iShares Global Clean Energy: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>3M: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>AT&amp;T: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Advanced Micro Devices: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Procter &amp; Gamble: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Roku: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Caterpillar: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Salesforce: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Enphase Energy: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Alibaba: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>PayPal: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Thermo Fisher: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Spotify: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Snap Inc.: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Ambarella: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Crispr Therapeutics: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Trade Desk: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>DraftKings: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Teladoc: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Waitr Holdings: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Bilibili: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Chewy: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Agilent Technologies: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Repay Holdings: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>WisdomTree NASDAQ 100: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://C3.ai\">C3.ai</a>: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>Airbnb: 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>I expected more &quot;trolly&quot; recommendations and a stronger bias for certain stocks, but overall I have to say I evaluate the portfolio as stronger than expected and quite solid overall.</p>\n\n<p>At start (purchase of <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> portfolio) my 2 portfolios have a growth of 2.48% and 3.15%, but we all know that the 1-2 weeks they have been running don&#39;t mean a lot for a full year, so I think we can ignore that.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I make this so detailed is because I want to look back in either 3 or 6 months and compare what happened and look back again after 2021 is over and see how it worked out. For that this post here will be used as reference, so if you want to add any prediction or similar in the comments to get back to on future posts, then feel free to do so.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
