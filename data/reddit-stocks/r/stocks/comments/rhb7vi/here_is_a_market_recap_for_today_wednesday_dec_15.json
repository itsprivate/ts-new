  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 15, 2021**\n\nThe stock market opened the day but reversed course and bounced today as investors digested the Federal Reserve’s final monetary policy decision of 2021 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech against a backdrop of persistent inflationary pressures. Bond yields rose up in the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s announcement, rising above 1.46%.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.56%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +2.28%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): 1.02%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.59%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -6.84%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.81%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.85%\n* UnitedHealth (UNH): +3.11%\n\nToday, the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Fed’s dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. \n\nSince the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has added trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to boost liquidity during a time of crisis and prevent a credit crunch. In November, the Fed started to taper the pace of those aggregate purchases by $15 billion per month, and will now double that pace to $30 billion per month.\n\nA statement by the Fed said, “In light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.”\n\nThe new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.\n\nA quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).\n\nThe updated dot plots, which map out each of the FOMC members’ projections for where rates will be in coming years, shows the median member of the committee projecting three rate hikes next year, another three in 2023, and another two in 2024. Link for dot-plot below\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf)\n\nThe Fed said, “Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.”\n\nThe median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, \n\nclocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Fed’s September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy)\n\nThe next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.\n\nArt Hogan, Chief Market Strategist at the National Securities Corporation said, “When you have an anticipation of higher interest rates, growth stocks or long-duration growth stocks certainly get hit the hardest. When you do that net present value calculation with a higher interest rate, that implied multiple or ascribed multiple to growth names comes in. So a lot of that's been priced in. When you think about some of those real ‘growth-y’ names and momentum names and risk assets, they've seen a lot of carnage already.\"\n\nHe continued, “What the market is trying to tell us here is that when you set your asset allocation plan for next year, you want to have a barbell approach with growth on one side — you want to have those growth names that are actually valued at a multiple to earnings, not a multiple to revenues or a multiple to cash flows or a multiple to sales. We anticipate 2022 is going to be very much like 2021, where you really want to have a balance between growth and value.\"\n\nI broadly agree with this perspective, 2021 was a hard year for a lot of people who went too heavy into growth after an insane 2020. It’s always important to have a good mix between growth, value, and I’ll add safe ETFs.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Pfizer (PFE) jumped to a fresh record intraday high on Wednesday amid optimism over the company's COVID-19 pill, called Paxlovid. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the White House had ordered enough of the antiviral pills to treat 10 million Americans, and that he was \"encouraged by the promising data\" that the drug-maker released on the pill. Pfizer's data showed earlier this week that the drug decreased the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for high-risk adults. \n* Amazon's web hosting platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced connectivity issues Wednesday morning, triggering outages at platforms from Zoom Video Communications to Amazon-owned Twitch and other online services. \n* Retail sales were up 0.3% in November compared to October, [the Commerce Department said on Wednesday](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf). This came in below the 0.8% monthly increase consensus economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. In October, retail sales rose 1.8%, which was upwardly revised from the 1.7% increase previously expected. \n* The office of the U.S. Trade Representative is concerned with Canada's announcement that it will continue to pursue a unilateral digital services tax, a USTR spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. “If Canada adopts a DST, USTR would examine all options, including under our trade agreements and domestic statutes,” it said.\n* Food safety issues were found at over a dozen Starbucks outlets in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, regulators said on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. coffee chain was criticized for violations at two other outlets in another city.\n* The Digital Markets Act (DMA), unveiled by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last December, sets out a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants designated as online gatekeepers with fines up to 10% of global turnover for violations, a global first.",
