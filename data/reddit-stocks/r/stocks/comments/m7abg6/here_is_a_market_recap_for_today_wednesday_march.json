  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Stocks edged higher, rallying sharply in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) key monetary policy meeting and an upgraded economic outlook by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields rose again, with the 10-year benchmark at 1.646% at the time of writing.</p>\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”</p>\n\n<p>Concerns continue to flare regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Germany, France, Italy, and Spain becoming the latest countries to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination efforts, which were already behind schedule. Studies are currently being conducted in the UK and other places. More information is needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Walt Disney’s (DIS) two theme parks in California will reopen on April 30 to roughly 15% capacity of guests, the company said on today.</li>\n<li>Chinese e-commerce company Pinduoduo Inc. has overtaken Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to become the country&#39;s largest e-commerce company by annual active buyers, according to figures Pinduoduo released on Wednesday.
