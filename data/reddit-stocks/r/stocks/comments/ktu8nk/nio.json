I think they are going to be up huge premarket Monday but who knows. What is everyone’s buy under price or do you have one ? We all know they are currently trading way above earnings similar to Tesla, and still have yet to show us as investors that they can produce a profit. Thanks in advance.\nAvg price 41.50</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
