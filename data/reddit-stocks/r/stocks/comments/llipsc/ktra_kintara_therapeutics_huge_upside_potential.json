I’ve read their 10-Q report to the SEC as well. It took me a few hours to dig into this one.</p>\n\n<p>So, I mentioned this stock last week in the facebook group &amp; discord, as I wanted to research it and do a DD (due diligence). Took me around 3 hours to dig into this. I have all my statements backed by sources. I feel like I found a heavily undervalued company, with huge upside.</p>\n\n<p>There was a nice pullback today, and I’ll explain why and how (further down)</p>\n\n<p>Doing research like this is fun for me, so I don’t mind sharing it, and teaching others how to look at things. I put a lot of work into this. If you want to check out more of my analysis &amp; research, check out: <a href=\"https://www.flowcode.com/page/fluentinfinance\">https://www.flowcode.com/page/fluentinfinance</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Looks very promising. Good phase 3 trials data will send this to up. <strong>Also, fuck CANCER.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How I found it:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I came across this on Reddit, because someone liked the company because they had a family member who died from cancer, but the drug that this company it working on could have potentially saved them. So I researched it. I am always looking for game changers.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>My plan:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a long term investment, not a get rich quick stock pick. But, when this one catches momentum, it will blow up, for those of you are patient. And, we are actually investing in a company, who is out to stop cancer.</p>\n\n<p>I am in at 4,000 shares @ $2.43 average cost. (and looking to put in another $10,000)</p>\n\n<p>***image on profile**</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What they do AND why it’s important:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kintara is dedicated to the development of innovative cancer therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. They focus on developing and commercializing anti-cancer therapies to treat cancer patients. $KTRA is a clinical stage drug development company. They have two Phase 3-ready therapeutics. They are currently in Phase 3 trials of some new cancer therapeutics, primarily focusing on common forms of brain and breast cancers. Phase 2 trials were very strong, showing increases in life expectancy from their therapeutics:</p>\n\n<p>(1) VAL-083 for treating glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and most aggressive form of primary brain cancer in adults. VAL-083, a DNA-targeting agent for the treatment of drug-resistant solid tumors. Kintara is completing multiple Phase II trials for VAL-083 to treat brain cancer, one of the most difficult malignancies to address. VAL-083 has several features that make it particularly appropriate for GBM, including its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and its mechanism of action which introduces irreversible DNA crosslinks that are not easily overcome by MGMT repair enzymes.</p>\n\n<p>(2) REM-001 for treating cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (CMBC).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4 drugs, and Two drugs in phase 3 (and one of those is on the “fast track”) (FDA put it on the fast track for a reason):</strong></p>\n\n<p>***image on profile**</p>\n\n<p>This wonderful drug is Providing Hope to Those Battling Glioblastoma Brain Cancer</p>\n\n<p>After phase 3 is done, this stock should really pop. Like literally no one on Twitter or google is talking about this company. (I want you to go to twitter and google and look around.) There are only 2 institutional holders, and one only got in last week. And the person who got in is my favorite hedge fund manager of all time. (More on this further down)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Moat/ Advantage over others:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kintara said it is the only company approved to initiate trials for all 3 GBM patient groups, including newly-diagnosed unmethylated (&gt;60% of GBM patients), newly-diagnosed methylated (&lt;40% of GBM patients &gt;&lt;40% of GBM patients), and recurrent: <a href=\"https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/937995/kintara-therapeutics-is-developing-innovative-cancer-therapies-for-rare-unmet-medical-needs-937995.html\">https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/937995/kintara-therapeutics-is-developing-innovative-cancer-therapies-for-rare-unmet-medical-needs-937995.html</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$800M market growing to $1.4B in 20271</li>\n<li>~30,000 newly-diagnosed patients in US/EU –</li>\n<li>~14,000 recurrent patients in US/EU</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*The source for all of these is Page 5 of their investor presentation: <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_188be1ec5f23fed5c962660d907234c1/kintara/db/241/1956/pdf/Kintara+Therapeutics+February+2021.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1IGSNYmOjNIWYfnoPhAYrhrq1ey1fX3qFFboE5V3DdnfEB1JykaPM-XDw\">https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_188be1ec5f23fed5c962660d907234c1/kintara/db/241/1956/pdf/Kintara+Therapeutics+February+2021.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1IGSNYmOjNIWYfnoPhAYrhrq1ey1fX3qFFboE5V3DdnfEB1JykaPM-XDw</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are some words from people in the field, in regards to this company:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The two drugs that are in the spotlight are for a very niche market. Totals about 240,000 patients a year. I think this is a good thing - I believe niche medical solutions/products tend to do well because they focus on something small and get it right. As opposed to swallowing too much at once. The drug has also been FDA approved which is a big hurdle to overcome. Definitely a challenge we will face in the future at my company. They also have patents so their product is protected.</p>\n\n<p>One of the drugs has an 80% clinical efficacy according to their studies which is promising. The drug increases the lifespan of the patient pretty significantly - also a big positive. One of the drugs can pass the blood brain barrier - another significant feat, and competitive advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the company looks really promising. Thank you for sending this Andrew. I’m going to do some more digging to see if I can find an actual white paper or some sort of research results to assess the drug more.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Positives:</strong></p>\n\n<p>They are well capitalized to achieve clinical milestones. They just had a nice cash infusing, so their balance sheet is strong overall, even if revenue is yet to be achieved (as things are in trials obvious). They received net proceeds of approximately $21.6 million. $KTRA said thus provides it with sufficient capital to fully fund “multiple value-accretive clinical milestones.“</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/937995/kintara-therapeutics-is-developing-innovative-cancer-therapies-for-rare-unmet-medical-needs-937995.html\">https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/937995/kintara-therapeutics-is-developing-innovative-cancer-therapies-for-rare-unmet-medical-needs-937995.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Kintara Therapeutics says it has enough cash to fund its planned operations into the fourth quarter of calendar 2021:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/941218/kintara-therapeutics-says-it-has-enough-cash-to-fund-its-planned-operations-into-the-fourth-quarter-of-calendar-2021-941218.html\">https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/941218/kintara-therapeutics-says-it-has-enough-cash-to-fund-its-planned-operations-into-the-fourth-quarter-of-calendar-2021-941218.html</a></p>\n\n<p>I’m always skeptical of things. One of the main reasons that I like this stock, is because no one is really speaking about it yet. Try googling this, barely anything when you go to the “news” section. Only one website is talking about it. Also, Check twitter too, barely any mentions. It’s flying under the radar. So if it gains some momentum the price target should hit.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason I like it, is that This stock is not optionable, so people cannot manipulate it as easy. There are no options. Options traders can run a stock.</p>\n\n<p>Even their Website looks legit &amp; clean. (You’d be surprised how many stocks have shitty sites. I will never invest in a company with a shitty website. If you can’t take time to make a nice site, why would I even invest in you?): <a href=\"https://www.kintara.com/about\">https://www.kintara.com/about</a></p>\n\n<p>If we look at other cancer stocks, their gains have been insane. Below are the top 5 cancer stocks. Look at that price action:</p>\n\n<p>***image on profile**</p>\n\n<p>(source: <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/these-were-the-best-cancer-stocks-of-2020/\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/these-were-the-best-cancer-stocks-of-2020/</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Looking at those drugs above, this drug will pop on news.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upcoming Milestones &amp; Catalysts:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Q-2 2021</strong> Phase 2 Top Line Results due: VAL-083: Adjuvant GBM Study</li>\n<li><strong>Q-2 2021</strong> Expecting to have first patient enrolled - REM-001: CMBC lead-in study</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/8763/board/20210115191630-screenshot-2021-01-15-kintara-therapeutics-kintar.png\">https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/8763/board/20210115191630-screenshot-2021-01-15-kintara-therapeutics-kintar.png</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you dig deep enough, you will see China is interested in this drug. (DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN CHINA?) VAL-083 is approved as a cancer chemotherapeutic in China for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and lung cancer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/kintara-announces-initiation-of-patient-recruitment-for-val-083-s-study-arm-in-the-gbm-agile-trial/\">https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/kintara-announces-initiation-of-patient-recruitment-for-val-083-s-study-arm-in-the-gbm-agile-trial/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Peers:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kintara is also undervalued relative to its peers in the GBM space, at a market capitalization of ~$45M, success of either drug is still not priced into shares,. Medicenna Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/TSE:MDNA/Medicenna/\">MDNA</a>) and Kazia Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/ASX:KZA/Kazia-Therapeutics-Ltd/\">KZA</a>) have market caps of ~$210 million and ~$130 million, respectively, despite being at a similar stage of development.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/939520/kintara-therapeutics-gets-price-target-bump-repeat-buy-rating-from-maxim-after-glioblastoma-trial-kicks-off-939520.html\">https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/939520/kintara-therapeutics-gets-price-target-bump-repeat-buy-rating-from-maxim-after-glioblastoma-trial-kicks-off-939520.html</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Targets:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maxim just updated their target price Jan 21 from $3 to $6-7.

It’s public float is only 61%</p>\n\n<p>***image on profile**</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shares Sold Short:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Barely any shares sold short.

Only 1% of this company is owned by institutions. When other institutions get in, price will jump. But look who bought in:</p>\n\n<p>***image on profile**</p>\n\n<p>Recently, the first two institutions just bought in. Others will catch on. Look up Renaissance Technologies &amp; Jim Simmons (it’s one of the most successful hedge funds ever), and they just got in a few days ago. They were the ones who probably pushed up the price, because they wanted to buy shares, and no one was selling. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Financials</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also note, more than 80% of the companies in the biotech sector have no revenue , $KTRA doesn’t have positive net income because they are going into phase 3 trials. The hope is that they pass the trials and then start making big money. at this point it is a matter of getting in cheap before it goes through.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you look at EPS, they are trending positive. They are losing less and less each year:</strong></p>\n\n<p>***image on profile**</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Ratio – One of the best in the Industry. Current Ratio is over 9, and is better than 73% of other biotechs:</strong></p>\n\n<p>***image on profile**</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is current ratio?</strong> Companies with a current ratio over 2, are usually secure and defensive (A CR &gt;2 is Recommended by Benjamin Graham &amp; David Dreman). Benjamin Graham is the father of value investing and Warren Buffets Mentor.</p>\n\n<p>The higher the current ratio, the more capable the company is of paying its obligations. (1 to 3 is sufficient) This is a company’s ability to pay its short-term debt with its current assets (usually defined as assets that are cash or will be turned into cash in a year or less, and liabilities that will be paid in a year or less.)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Management Team:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kintara.com/about/management-team\">https://www.kintara.com/about/management-team</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Greg A.

With Pharm companies, you have the accept &amp; expect this to be true, until they actually have a drug to profit from. So even though they are Down do to annual earnings, I don’t care. I’m positioning myself for the good news to come. Positioning myself to sell on the news. The EPS has been getting better each year, and the current ratio is one of the best among all biotech companies. Most biotech’s don’t turn a profit until their drug passes phase 3. (More on this later)</p>\n\n<p>Down from it’s high is $3.16 last week. I think it’s a good time to buy on the dip, I bought more. Initially, the price was pushed up, when the analyst updated their price targets.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the chart today, the price drop happened on no volume. Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact. (Whereas High volume pullbacks suggest that there could be a near-term reversal.) Look like day traders wanted to take profits on the recent run up</p>\n\n<p>***image on profile**</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technical Analysis</strong> on charts so you can sleep at night.
