People start conserving energy and changing their behavior,\" Lance said.\n\nThe new U.S. ban on importing Russian oil, gas and products \"makes sense,\" at least for now, Lance told the CERAWeek by S&amp;P Global conference, but if the war in Ukraine drags on for many months, a different plan would be needed to ensure sufficient oil supplies at affordable prices.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Lance said it would take 8-12 months to see \"the first drop of new oil\" if the company decided to pump more oil, which is \"why we have to be thinking about the medium and longer term.\"\n\nConocoPhillips expects to spend 20% more capital this year than in 2021 and will increase production, and could decide to put even more capital to work, the CEO said, but the company \"needs to make sure the returns are there.\"\n\n\"We're dealing with the same inflation and supply chain every other manufacturer is dealing with in the U.S.,\" Lance said, echoing comments made by Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub.",
