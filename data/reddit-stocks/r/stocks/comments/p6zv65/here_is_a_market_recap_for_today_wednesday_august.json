  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 18, 2021**\n\n*Sorry no highlights, took longer to write this edition of the recap.*\n\nStocks largely traded sideways before plunging in the last two hours of the market following the release of the Federal Reserve’s July Meeting Minutes, after the Fed revealed it may begin to taper the pace of their monthly bond purchases likely before the end of the year. This is not at all surprising, there was always an expectation and I have been warning for months that quantitative easing would likely taper towards the end of the year but as usual the market loves to overreact. It just shows that economic recovery is progressing nicely and the market is starting to be able to stand on its own legs. It is important to note that no consensus has emerged between participants regarding the taper timeline, as will be discussed below.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. \n\nFirst off, before the recap begins, I encourage everyone to read about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, in which the market freaked out after the Fed began tapering asset purchasing programs passed during the height of the 2008 crisis. I think something similar may be happening here. With how far the economy has come in terms of corporate earnings, improving labor market conditions, and an increasingly vaccinated population, the fundamentals for the economy are improving, so it is not surprising that pandemic-era support measures will begin slowing down. \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)\n\nThe timing and potential scope of a potential taper timeline has been a key question in the minds of market participants moving forward. In the latest meeting minutes, the Fed revealed that “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” \n\nIn order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, “A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.”\n\nOn inflation, the minutes said “With regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory” and “Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound.” However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.\n\nIn short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, “A few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.”\n\nI recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it's really not that long and super insightful: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\n“There is no success without hardship.” - Sophocles",
