  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 16, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed in a volatile session after getting a boost following the release of new economic data that showed retail sales for the month of August coming in stronger-than-expected, suggesting that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, held up despite rising coronavirus Delta variant concerns. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day with a gain of 0.07% and 0.08% respectively. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 0.17% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.17% and 0.19% down respectively. Jobless claims also came in near a pandemic-era low. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China’s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nIn a new weekly report by Factset, consensus analysts are still looking for S&P 500 earnings growth of nearly 28% for the third quarter. While a deceleration from the more than 80% growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year, that would still mark the third-highest year-over-year increase in earnings for the index since 2010. Third-quarter earnings reporting season is set to pick up next month. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* A host of news coming out of Facebook (FB) after journalists reviewed internal documents from the company. Not going to get into it here, but I recommend you check out was is going on surrounding Facebook.\n* Ford Motors (F) said it plans to boost capacity from the F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 80,000 per year thanks to strong demand, adding that the vehicle would be for sale next spring.\n* Nvidia’s (NVDA) co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who has built the company into the US’ most valuable chip maker, was named as one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People. I have said this publicly multiple times, but NVDA is my single favorite stock in the entire market.\n* Lucid’s (LCID) luxury sedan has received a government certification for a range of 520 miles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it’s the longest range EV rated so far. For comparisons, Tesla’s Model S was rated for a range of 405 miles, though it is a lot cheaper. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which operates popular dating app Tinder, said it was working on its own payment system to circumvent Apple and Google following the recent decision by US authorities to allow companies to offer third-party payment solutions within the Google and Apple app stores. \n* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) said it aims for net-zero emissions within the next 30 years. \n* Popular chatting platform Discord raised $500 million in a new founding round, bringing the value of the company to an estimated $15 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) originally tried to buy Discord many months ago, but it seems like the company is aiming to go public at some point. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $310 to $395 at Buy. Stock currently around $342\n* Adobe (ADBE) with two target raises. Stock currently around $665\n   * Barclays from $660 to $740 at Overweight\n   * BMO Capital Markets from $630 to $730 at Outperform\n* Biogen (BIIB) target raised by UBS Group from $442 to $475 at Buy. Stock currently around $300\n* Discover Financial Services (DFS) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $137 to $139 at Equal Weight\n* Fortinet (FTNT) target raised by BMO Capital Markets from $300 to $335 at Overweight. Stock currently around $305\n* Teck Resources (TECK) target raised by Deutshce Bank from $30 to $32 at Buy. Stock currently around $26\n\n“A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.” - Seneca",
