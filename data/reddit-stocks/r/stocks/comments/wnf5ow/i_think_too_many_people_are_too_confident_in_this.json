Supply chains are barely recovered, inflation around the world is way worse than America and if their economies hit hyper inflation their contributions to supply chains will only get worse.\n\nI’m just going to say it: there is no full resolutions to justify the markets at these prices. There are too many signs showing this is an emotional (greed) bull rally trap. None of the underlying problems have been solved, monetary policy will not change until at least 4-5% inflation, and instead of the Russian situation getting better- intel shows when winter comes it will only get worse and China/Taiwan is now a potential new threat. Maybe this rally will last another month or so, but new all time highs are probably not until after another downturn. Thoughts?",
