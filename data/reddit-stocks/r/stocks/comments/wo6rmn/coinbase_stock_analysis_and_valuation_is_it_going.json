The main questions that I want to address are, is Coinbase going bankrupt, and is there anything that the management can do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is Coinbase?**\n\nIn a nutshell, Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange platform founded back in June 2012. The description provided on their platform is a \"secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring and storing digital currency\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How does Coinbase make money?**\n\nAlmost 90% of all the revenue is related to transaction fees. Hence, to have a good idea of this stream, there are two separate parts to understand\n\n1. Transaction value\n2. Transaction fee (as % of the transaction value)\n\nLet's start with the first part. As we are already aware that the underlying transaction is related to cryptocurrencies, the transaction value is tied to the price of the cryptocurrencies as it is measured in USD. A transaction of 1 Bitcoin when the price is $50k is worth twice more than a transaction of 1 Bitcoin when the price is $25k. In this example, although the volume of the underlying asset did not change, the value of the transaction measured in USD has changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the transaction fee, we need to make a distinction between the two types of users of the platform (I use the term user instead of investors as I believe it is more accurate):\n\n1. Institutional users - accounting for 2/3 of the volume of the transactions (measured in $), but responsible for only 5% of the transactional fees (as their fee as a percentage is only 0.03%).\n2. Retail users - accounting for 1/3 of the volume, but responsible for 95% of the transaction fees (as their fee as a percentage is 1.2%, roughly 40x higher than the one for institutional users)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How can Coinbase grow?**\n\nSo, so far, we have a cryptocurrency exchange that makes money depending on:\n\n1. The value of the transaction (that is linked to cryptocurrency prices)\n2. The volume of transactions by retail users\n3. The fee that Coinbase can take as a % of the transaction\n\nKnowing these 3 variables, what is it that the management can do to increase the revenue?\n\nIn my opinion, not much. As for the cryptocurrency prices, they cannot (legally) influence them. As for the second and third, those are moving in opposite directions. To increase the volume, Coinbase could reduce the fees. However, that's not a sustainable way to grow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The financials**\n\nTo better understand the financials, it would be enough to take the last 2 full financial years (2020 and 2021) and the first half of 2022.\n\n**2020** \\- Revenue a bit over $1b, gross margin of 88%, operating expenses of $600m - ***looks great and profitable!***\n\n**2021** \\- Revenue a bit over $7b, gross margin of 83%, operating expenses of almost $3b - ***everything is growing and Coinbase is profitable!***\n\nNow, how can we justify this huge increase in revenue of 7x? Well, cryptocurrency prices went up a bit over 5x, and the remaining part is due to increased volume. We can always link the performance back to the 3 variables above.\n\n**H1 2022** \\- Revenue of $2b, gross margin of 77%, operating expenses of $2.5b - ***doesn't look as good anymore***\n\nBetween December 31st, 2021, and June 30th, 2022, the prices of cryptocurrencies dropped by over 50%. Hence, if the revenue of 2021 was $7b, we should expect roughly $3.5b for the first half of 2022 (assuming the same volume of transactions were processed and the fee is the same). As the revenue is much lower, it indicates that there were fewer transactions as well (that is also reported by Coinbase in their quarterly report).\n\nThe real difficulty comes when you take a look at the operating expenses as half of 2022 is almost comparable to **the entire 2021!**\n\nFor a company that cannot take any action to increase the revenue, it is spending A LOT more and has started to lose money (again).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The 3 bad news**\n\n**#1 - Competition** \\- They're not alone here, there's Crypto.com, Binance, Robinhood, FTX, eToro, Kraken, etc etc. Higher competition could have an impact on their 1% + fees for the retail users. That in turn could put them in an even more difficult financial position,\n\n**#2 - MTU (Monthly transacting users)** \\- One of the metrics that they have is related to the MTUs and in H1 2022 it is close to 9m (compared to 11m+ in 2021)\n\n**#3 - Assets on the platform** \\- Roughly 10-15% of all the assets have been withdrawn from their platform. Here's how I got to that conclusion:\n\n**Bitcoin** represents 44% of the assets on the platform. That was equal to $111.2b as of December 31st, 2021. Since then, the Bitcoin price declined significantly. So, if the same assets were on the platform, they would've been priced $60.7b lower ($111.2b - $60.7b = $50.5b).\n\nSo, $50.5b would be the expected value of Bitcoin measured in USD at the end of Q2/2022. Based on the Q2 report, this amount is $42.2b, that's $8.3b lower, almost 16% of what I would've expected. That represents a fair estimate of the assets that have been withdrawn from the platform!\n\n**Etherium** represents 20% of the assets on the platform, performing the same exercise, the percentage is 10.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, what's next?** **How do we value Coinbase?**\n\nCoinbase cannot be valued as the cash flows are dependent to a large extent on cryptocurrency prices (of course, they are also dependent on the volume &amp; the fee). That's why there's a 95% correlation between the stock price and Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, we can give it a try to see what makes sense based on different assumptions\n\n**Scenario 1 - Cryptocurrency prices (Especially Bitcoin/Etherium) remain the same or decrease**\n\nAt the moment, Coinbase is burning roughly $3b/year (assuming they don't cut their operating expenses). With $5.7b on cash remaining, the company won't survive for a long period of time (unless new cash is raised)\n\n**Scenario 2** \\- **Cryptocurrency prices go back to the levels of last year, the volume of transactions goes back to the levels of last year, and the transaction fee that Coinbase charges remain the same as last year**\n\nThis assumes a stable environment (which we can all agree is not realistic), but for the sake of the exercise, let's give it a try.\n\nRunning a DCF based on these assumptions (and an operating margin of 25%), the value per share is around **$68/share**. It is lower than where the stock is currently trading and significantly lower than the IPO price of **$250/share**. This is with a 9% discount rate (based on WACC - which again can be argued is way too low based on the risk the company has).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What can the management do?**\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of Brian Armstrong (CEO of Coinbase) and ask yourself, what can be done? My personal view is, not much. If the revenue is dependent on the cryptocurrency prices and it is amplified with the user behavior, the only segment that the management can focus on is the operating expenses. That's Marketing &amp; Sales, Research &amp; Development, General &amp; Administrative.\n\nHowever, even the best management in the entire world is helpless if cryptocurrency prices are low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback on this post as well as your take on Coinbase.
