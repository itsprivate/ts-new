Canoo also teased during its earnings call that it will be building some prototypes for an unnamed partner, which of course the internet jumped on the idea that it must be Walmart.\n\nI'm a little skeptical of this, since Walmart already has other car partners like Ford and Gatik. Does it make sense to add Canoo?\n\nMy thesis is that Canoo is a decent speculative stock even if it doesn't have this Walmart deal. There's lots of other tailwinds such as:\n\n* The infrastructure bill.\n* Canoo fills a niche that's not directly competitive against Rivian or Tesla (and definitely not Lucid). For example Canoo would be great for local governments and schools which will be forced to go green and would like vehicles with low maintenance costs.\n* The market is hungry for EV stock right now. And at sub $20 this is something people can feel good throwing a few bucks in and hold for years.\n\nPossible cons:\n\n* Worried that Canoo doesn't manufacture it's own vehicles.\n* Canoo already had one hyped up story with the acquisition talks with Apple. If this Walmart thing go south investors will *really* hate Canoo.\n\n**Possible discussion topics:**\n\n* Are there *other* possible reasons to move to Bentonville? Perhaps that city offer huge incentives not seen elsewhere, or maybe it's actually a great hub of manufacturing. Anyone in that area know?\n\n* How does Canoo stack up against other EV \"hype\" stocks right now?\n\nDisclosure: I bought some Canoo this morning, and I kinda like their aesthetic.",
