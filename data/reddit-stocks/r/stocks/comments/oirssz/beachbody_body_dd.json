  "selftext": " So, I did a DD on $PTON a few months ago, which brought me to this competitor company. I would’ve included it on my list of competitors in that post, but it hadn’t merged at the time.\n\nI see this company as a potential 2-3x bagger either in the short-term or within 1-2 years, and here’s why.\n\n**Overview:**\n\nBeachbody ($BODY) is a fitness company that’s been operating for 20+ years (founded in 1998). They’ve just recently completed a three-way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness.\n\nBeachbody has brought their digital content, fitness instructors and subscribers, as well as nutritional products to the table. Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment.\n\nUnder the name Beachbody, they plan to be a direct competitor of Peloton, but aiming at the “everyman” market as opposed to the health nut/upper-income market like Peloton. For that reason, their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper. \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Here’s what makes it look good:**\n\n* 400 million in cash on hand\n* Zero debt \n* 3.2 million subscribers \n* 95.8% month over month digital retention \n* 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021\n* Has some big names on board – Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, Shaq\n* Has experienced CEOS directing things, especially in the area of digital content service – Kevin Mayer (ex-CEO of TikTok, and ex-VP of Disney+), Carl Daikeler (CEO and founder of Beachbody), Jon Longdon (CEO of OpenFit and co-founder of Beachbody)\n* Carl Daikeler claims he doesn’t plan to sell a single share\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can read more about the merger and the company’s info in [this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/forest-road-acquisition-corp-and-the-beachbody-company-announce-combined-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-for-beachbody-and-myx-2021-05-19-91591019?siteid=bigcharts&dist=bigcharts&tesla=y). \n\nSo, basically, we’ve got a company with experience, seemingly good financials, a massive subscriber pool (many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers), and excellent retention rate.\n\nYou can read about the details of expected earnings, their plans and products through the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f75fdc89cf35e7524ec4b54/t/6023f07523d4531acaea9e8b/1612968070409/Beachbody+PIPE+Presentation.pdf).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, with all this promise, why is the price of the stock so low?**\n\nWell, for one thing, it has just merged, and a drop after de-spacing while people lock in profits is common. Also, Beachbody hasn’t had much PR, so there hasn’t been a lot to push this stock up. It’s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low. \n\nMarket makers have been using this to their advantage, and are having a great time pushing around retail. They’ve been shorting it heavily, taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit.\n\nFor this reason, buying shares rather than options is the better choice. Last month, the MMs took the stock price down to precisely $9.99 at the very end of the day of expiry of $10 calls, so that they’d all expire worthless. The manipulation was blatant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, if MMs are controlling this stock, why am I bullish?**\n\nBecause all it takes is a bit of PR and volume, and this stock could take off. The MMs are controlling this right now because they can, but it’s impossible for that to last forever once there’s PR, earnings and the wider market recognises its value. They’ve shorted it HEAVILY, and last I read it was at approx. 27% short interest percentage, and only 40,000 shares (https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy) available to short.\n\nIt's also been the only other NYSE stock on the SSR list along with $AMC.\n\nCatalysts are already starting which is recently pushing up the share price. The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs – one at **$12** and another at **$16**, so analysts thus far are decidedly bullish on $BODY.\n\nBeachbody’s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing, so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months.\n\nNow, I can’t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now, but the fact of the matter is, in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come, it’s highly unlikely they could maintain this low share price permanently. At some point they have to cover or reverse position. \n\n**Short Squeeze**\n\nSome people are talking about a short squeeze with regards to this stock, which, yes, it’s a potential short squeeze candidate, but if there’s one thing $GME and $AMC has shown us, it’s that you need a LOT of buying pressure to even have a chance of that. It’s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen, and I’m not hanging my hopes on that. The thing is, in my opinion, we don’t NEED a short squeeze here. The MMs must know that this isn’t a sustainable position for a growing company, but since we’re still early in the game, they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in.\n\nA lot of people, including myself, aren’t selling because it’s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price. It’s only a matter of time.\n\n**Bearish Points:**\n\n1) *There are many who say this company will fail because it’s got some MLM practices.* \n\nThat would worry me if they hadn’t been in operation for 20+ years, and, as shitty as I sound, I’m not bothered since other MLM-type companies like Herbalife do just fine. I just want to make money on the stock. The fact that it’s got ex-Disney+ and ex-TikTok CEO on board makes me even more confident.\n\n2) *Things are still speculative. We haven’t seen their earnings yet.* \n\nYep, fair enough. There is still some risk in that regard. There’s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R&D and marketing will cut into their profits, possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was. However, this current market is very bullish and forward-looking, so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow, especially since it’s already so low. \n\n3) *This is a pandemic stock. After the pandemic is over, it’ll crash along with Peloton.*\n\nIt certainly looks like we're in a bubble right now, and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst, or at least have a bunch of corrections. I can see it happening with Peloton at some point (it’s already had a correction though it’s climbing back up), but this stock price is already so low, it can’t really fall much further, so in that way it’s very low-risk compared to a lot of other investments. Great upside, small downside. Also, the pandemic has changed things permanently, and while I agree it has given stocks like PTON a big boost, I’m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future, so I’d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually, even if they happen to be brought down by corrections.\n\n**Disclosure:** I currently have 1,100 shares at $10.34. My PT is between $15-18 in the short-term providing the overall market stays bullish, and $25-35 within 1-2 years. As always, do your own DD, don’t take my word for it, etc., etc.",
