  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 3, 2021**\n\nStocks finished the day mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) falling while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pushed higher, closing 0.31% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.46%. Market participants are digesting the release of the August Jobs Report, which showed a sharp deceleration in employment amid the latest surge by the coronavirus Delta variant. \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly ⅓ of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month’s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, “While I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we’ve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.”\n\nThis is a little confusing but follow me here. In a weird quirk of the market, the low employment numbers actually benefit equities by staving off the need for tapering, which is why we saw tech stocks in particular popping today. Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” Regardless, as I have said before, I remain unconcerned by taper talks, I think the real test for equities will come when discussion about potential interest rate hikes begins.\n\nSteve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said of the report “What we’re seeing is the market really trying to wrestle with the idea of what matters to it more: Is it about the economy, or is it about monetary policy? Now, we’ve been in a monetary-driven market for so long it’s hard to say that monetary factors aren’t at the forefront of the market’s mindset right now. But what I think we may be seeing here … we can’t really figure out whether this delays tapering in a meaningful way. But there’s stuff in here that is not necessarily bad other than the headline number. Wages are good, the unemployment rate is good.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Moderna (MRNA), Workday (WDAY), Nvidia (NVDA) were among the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq today, driving it higher.\n* US auto safety regulators disclosed they are investigating a July 26 fatal crash involving a Tesla that may or may not have been using the advanced driver assistance system. This is the latest regulatory headache for Tesla and their autonomous driving technology given there is already another investigation currently underway.\n* Dish’s (DISH) Sling TV, which reportedly has 2.7 million subs as of December 2020, has partnered with Penn National Gaming (PENN) to launch a Barstools Sports Channel on its streaming service. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which owns popular dating app Tinder, filed a letter with Dutch competition regulators to public state their decision regarding a complaint filed against Apple for anti-competitive practices for forcing Match to use Apple’s in-app payment system. Ever since Fortnite-maker Epic Games’ original lawsuit against Apple regarding this seems more and more companies are hopping on. A new South Korean law that was recently passed forces Apple and Google to accept third-party payment systems.\n* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Party’s drive to “common prosperity”. \n* Beyond Meats (BYND) COO Sanjay Shah steps down from his role with no public explanation given. He originally joined the company from Tesla in 2019\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Adobe (ADBE) target raised by Argus from $650 to $764 at Buy. Stock currently around $665\n* Broadcom (AVGO) with a host of target raises. Average price target $550 at Buy. Stock currently around $498\n* DocuSign (DOCU) with a host of target raises.
