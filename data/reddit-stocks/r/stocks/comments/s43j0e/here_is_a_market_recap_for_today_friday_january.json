Have a wonderful long weekend.*\n\nStocks ended the day mixed in another highly volatile session, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pushing sharply higher in the last hour of the session to close higher after trading in the red most of the day. \n\nMarket participants digested the latest CPI and PPI numbers, new commentary by Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and newly released monthly US retail sales report and a mixed set of earnings reports from big banks.\n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.05%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.62%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.56%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.14%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.17%\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +3.12%\n* Shopify (SHOP): +3.62%\n* Las Vegas Sands (LVS): +14.15%\n* Gamestop (GME): -4.76%\n\nUS retail sales slumped by the most in 10 months, suggesting that the current pace of inflation coupled with surging Omicron infections are taking their toll on consumer spending. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that US retail sales decreased -1.9% in December, slumping after a revised +0.2% in November, and greatly missing the -0.01% drop expected by economists. \n\n10 of the 13 retail categories showed declines in receipts last month, led by non-store retailers, which includes e-commerce. Those sales plummeted 8.7% from a month earlier.\n\nDepartment-store receipts decreased 7% after a 5.5% drop in November. Sales at furniture stores, electronics outlets, and sporting goods establishments also fell.\n\nReceipts at restaurants and bars, the report’s only services-oriented category and a sign of omicron’s early impact, dropped 0.8% after rising the prior month.\n\nMotor vehicle sales declined 0.4%. Automakers last year struggled to meet demand as production efforts were hampered by shortages of semiconductors are parts. The result was fewer vehicles on dealer lots and limited choices for buyers.\n\nThe government’s report showed retail sales, excluding volatile gasoline and motor vehicles prices, slumped -2.5% in December.\n\nHere is the full retail sales report: [https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts\\_current.pdf](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf)\n\nIn her confirmation hearing before Congress, newly re-elected Fed Governor Lael Brainard suggested the central bank could begin raising interest rates — a move that would tighten financial conditions and help bring down inflation — \"as soon as asset purchases are terminated.\" The Federal Reserve is currently set to end its asset-purchase tapering process in March. \n\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.\n\nMatthew Miskin, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Managemen, said “Two of the biggest things have been the supply chain disruptions and the fiscal stimulus. As the pandemic comes more under control this year, as the Omicron wave hopefully dissipates, we likely see the supply chain disruptions come off, and then we’re not going to get more fiscal stimulus ... That in our view does cause inflation to come down over the course of the year.\" \n\nEarnings season is kicking off, with big financial institutions reporting earnings this morning. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares fell more than 5% after the company [posted lower-than-expected fourth-quarter ](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2021/4th-quarter/ae462261-4964-48c6-b947-4b69963d1143.pdf)trading revenues and rising costs as compensation expenses increased. The stock drop marked JPMorgan's worst post-earnings decline since 2011. Citigroup (C) shares also fell after posting a similar miss on fixed-income and equities trading revenues for the quarter.  Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose, on the other hand, after [posting quarterly revenue](https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/fourth-quarter-2021-earnings.pdf) that topped estimates as both commercial and consumer loans picked up at the end of last year. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Biden administration announced its nominees to fill out the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, tapping Sarah Bloom Raskin, Lisa Cook, and Philip Jefferson for the roles. Each nominee must still go before the Senate Banking Committee for confirmation.\n* According to new Federal Reserve data Friday, manufacturing output declined by 0.3% in December to reverse course after a 0.6% rise in November. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.3% monthly rise in production in December, based on Bloomberg data. Manufacturing accounts for about 12% of overall economic activity in the U.S. \n* The [University of Michigan's preliminary January Surveys of Consumers index](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) came in at 68.8, falling from December's 70.6. This was below consensus estimates for a reading of 70.0, according to Bloomberg data. \n* Starbucks (SBUX) employees at three more restaurants in New York state will vote on unionization, a U.S. labor official ruled Friday.\n* The U.S. auto safety regulator said on Friday that it is discussing the heating issues of some Tesla vehicles with the automaker and evaluating \"potential safety concerns.\"\n* Investors piled into stocks and ditched cash, gold and bonds, especially safe haven ones, in the week to Wednesday, BofA said in its weekly flow tracking note published on Friday. Equity funds attracted $30.5 billion while bond funds suffered their first outflow in four weeks at $2.9 billion, cash funds lost $43.5 billion, and gold at $100 million, BofA said in its note based on EPFR data.\n* Microsoft is investing $50 million in a LanzaJet facility in Georgia that will produce jet fuel from ethanol next year, LanzaJet said. LanzaJet, based in Chicago, said it has nearly completed on-site engineering at its Freedom Pines Fuels Biorefinery, with plans to start producing 10 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel per year from sustainable ethanol by 2023.\n* General Motors (GM) said a trio of chips from Qualcomm Inc will power the \"Ultra Cruise\" driver-assistance feature on a luxury Cadillac sedan next year.\n\n\"Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.\" -*Ralph Waldo Emerson*",
