  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 11, 2021**\n\nStocks reversed coursed and ended lower today as investors continue to digest the September Jobs report, ongoing supply-side disruptions and wait for the beginning of earnings season to kick off later this week. The benchmark Treasury yield rose to 1.61%, its highest level since June, which puts pressure on technology stocks, and the price of crude oil continued its staggering rise, with Brent crude topping $84 a barrel, the highest price since 2018. \n\nIn recent weeks, amid elevated global demand and persistent supply-side disruptions, the price of commodities, from oil and natural gas to cotton and coal, has exploded, with many currently at multi-year highs or record levels. A similar dynamic happened earlier in the year with the price of lumber, which eventually come back down to reasonable levels. I expect the price of commodities to recede once again as labor market imbalances are met and supply-side disruptions caused by the pandemic smooth over.\n\nLast week, the Labor Department released its monthly jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. \n\nThough employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a \"decent\" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. \n\nLooking ahead, market participants will receive the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer and Producer price indexes for September. Increases in core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, are expected to remain elevated. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “Stagflation' was the most common word in client conversations this week as equity market volatility remained elevated. Stagflation is not our economists' base case expectation, but the weak historical performance of equities in stagflationary environments helps explain why investors are concerned.\" As a reminder, stagflation refers to an environment in which economic growth is slow but inflation high. As Kostin said, I do not see this scenario moving forward as expectations for economic growth moving forward remain high. \n\nEarnings season, which is typically a very volatile time in equity markets, is set to kick off later this week, with big US banks reporting. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The bounce in Chinese stocks was stopped in its tracks after the government announced it was investigating and seeking to curb ties between state financial institutions and private companies.\n* China, the largest car market on Earth, also announced new regulations to limit and regulate the data sent abroad by vehicles, a blow to Western companies looking to expand in China.\n* Longtime Disney (DIS) studio head Alan Horn will retire from the company. \n* Despite recent choppiness, the IPO market remains red-hot, with More than 2,000 IPOs raising a combined $421 billion globally by the end of September, a record high. That was more than double the proceeds raised during the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA (NVDA) today announced that they trained what they claim is the largest and most capable AI-powered language model to date: Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation. Love to see it, like I have said multiple times before, NVIDIA is my single favorite stock, I think they will play a huge role in powering future technologies. \n* Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) was moving headquarters from California to Austin, Texas. As a reminder, Musk’s SpaceX is already headquartered near there. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Social Finance Technologies (SOFI) target raised by Morgan Stanley to $25 at Overweight. Stock gapped up 13% on the news and is now trading around $18.50\n* Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Barclays from $174 to $186 at Overweight. Stock currently around $160\n* Citigroup target raised by Jefferies from $81 to $87 at Buy. Stock currently around $72\n* HubSpot (HUBS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $675 to $750 at Overweight. Stock currently around $682\n* JP Morgan (JPM) target raised by Jefferies from $177 to $198 at Buy. Stock currently around $167\n* Netflix (NFLX) with two target raises. Stock currently around $627\n   * Credit Suisse from $643 to $740 at Outperform\n   * KeyCorp from $645 to $670 at Overweight.\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Wedbush from $470 to $600 at Positive. Stock currently around $500\n\n“The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.” *-*Nelson Mandela",
