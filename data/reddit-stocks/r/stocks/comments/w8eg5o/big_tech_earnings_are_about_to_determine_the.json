GOOGL, -0.36% GOOG, -0.14%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.05%, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.74%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, -1.55% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.59% — prepares to report, there are serious doubts about their near future for the first time. All five have signaled that they are cutting costs or plan to soon, as MarketWatch’s Jon Swartz reported.\n\nAmazon ripped off the Band-Aid three months ago, and it looks like some of its Big Tech cohorts may look to do the same in this earnings season. Apple has reportedly planned cost cuts for next year, while Microsoft is closing down open positions and making small layoffs. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on the last day of the second quarter that they face one of the “worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned employees of slowing hiring just a few days after the quarter close. Results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.10% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.51% show concerns about the digital-advertising business are founded. Even an early warning from Microsoft about its earnings and the knowledge that Amazon is already cutting costs may not be enough to truly prepare Wall Street for what may be coming. One area that could cause a major ripple is a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, as Therese Poletti opined, with one analyst telling her that “people are going to freak out.”\n\nAny big moves for those five companies would have major ripple effects in the market. Collectively worth roughly $7.5 trillion despite the declines that have already struck this year, the five companies make up about 23% of the total market cap of the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.13%, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group. The group’s earnings and revenue have buffeted the entire market in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic juiced their balance sheets. Collectively, the quintet produced profit surpassing $320 billion last year, with sales topping $1.4 trillion, which would rank 13th in gross domestic product as a nation, just behind Brazil and ahead of Australia, according to World Bank figures.\n\nThis year is going to be a tough comparison to that performance, especially after Amazon reported a loss of nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. And cost-cutting from those companies will have an effect on the larger tech economy. The true concern in Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that a domino effect happens — Big Tech cuts costs, hurting smaller tech companies that rely on them, who in turn go under or at least cut back on costs such as cloud computing, cloud software, hardware and more, causing more pain throughout the industry.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-earnings-are-about-to-determine-the-direction-of-the-market-11658769593?mod=newsviewer\\_click](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-earnings-are-about-to-determine-the-direction-of-the-market-11658769593?mod=newsviewer_click)",
