He died in 1983 and my mother and my uncle (who's an ass) would be the inheritants. There's about a dozen of them all counter signed and registered but definitely not cashed or anything.  Now some are out of business but sone are not.. Like 50 shares of GE which if i follow the splits is now 600 shares. 100 shares  Frontier oil which is now 3200 shares of Holly Frontier.  And about 10 others.  What is the simplest way to deal with this.  I'm gonna get a death cert for my grandfather and my father so my mother will get her half, i suppose I have to notify my uncle whose already rich.  But by my calculations just those two alone with the unpaid dividends is over $300,000.  Need someone who deals with this regularly.",
