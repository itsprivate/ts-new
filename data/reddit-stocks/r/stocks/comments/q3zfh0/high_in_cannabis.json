This post is not written to pump cannabis market, frankly I don’t give a fuck if you invest or not - this post is written so that I can share the knowledge I learned in the cannabis industry. Invest at your own discretion, and don’t cry if you lose or win.\n\nWe all remember 2018, a meme year when everyone and everything was in cannabis stocks, tilray was pumping just like any other Canadian cannabis stock - too bad this was all a pump and dump and everything crashed harder than a Japanese kamikaze did in 1944. \n\nLet’s fast forward to 2021 -  EV/ EBITDA multiples for cannabis stocks Are at historic lows - cannabis shares are down on average 40% since their peak. In the world of finance, 95% of companies get valued by their EV/EBITDA multiple, ( enterprise value / ebitda - if you want to read more on this investopedia is your best friend) \n\nAnyway, U.S. has THE best cannabis stocks in the world, growing at 100% Y/Y and overall having positive cash flows (ex. GTI, Trulieve) \n\nLet me tell you one thing, as of now Cannabis stocks are trading at very low multiples compared to their growth ~10-15x, EV/EBITDA 2021 and 5-10x EBITDA 2022. If you compare it to Uber or DoorDash or snowflake which are trading with at 100+ multiple and growing way slower. **I don’t believe in a lot of things, but I can bet my left nut that cannabis stocks are currently undervalued based on the growth they are having **\n\nIf you don’t trust me - fine. Look at any fast growing company on the NYSE or NASDAQ and compare their multiples to cannabis stock. I can guarantee cannabis stock will be trading at a lower multiple than counterparts when you account for revenue and EBITDA growth rate. \n\nNow that we covered multiple expansion, let me talk about management and growth opportunities. \n\nTwo things I want to cover:\n\nManagement teams: go on any large cannabis website be it GTI, Curaleaf, Cresco, trulieve or any other and you will find that at least 50% of management will be made up of finance legends from Goldman or any other respected bank - they know their shit when it comes to growing the business, and the fact that they or on these teams should tell you a lot. If it doesn’t, look at the companies the my sold and what **multiples** they sold them at. Also, many of these team members were actively managing portfolios that yielded insane returns. \nGrowth: Cannabis is bound to be legalized, and even if it isn’t, there is plenty of opportunity for state growth. Every year there are more states legalizing some form of cannabis sale, which opens up a new market for these companies to enter. Sooner or later federal legalization will come - this will lead to more growth ops and revenue expansion. I don’t want to dwell too deep into this topic because M&A markets are very complex and expansion leads to consolidation at attractive multiples - this is a topic for another discussion. \n\nYou are probably thinking by now, “why the fuck are these cannabis stocks not trading at high multiples now?”\nHere are me three reason which I truly believe in:\n1. Equity and debt available in the markets: cannabis stock are not legal in the U.S. federally which means they can not be officially listed on stock exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ therefore they do not have access to cheap equity and are not able to grow easily. Same with debt - historically these cannabis companies where getting their debt at ~13% with a lot of restrictive covenants and warrants simply because large banks like JP Morgan were not comfortable with lending to cannabis companies and crossing the grey lines \n2. Cannabis is not federally legalized yet, which leads to multiples expansion problems but the main being investor confidence. No one wants to pay a high multiple on a business that is currently illegal and that is simple as that. \n3. U.S. cannabis stocks not listed on major exchanges. This is a bigger problem than many people realize - a large demographic that would likely invest in cannabis is millennial investors which just so happen to use Robinhood and WeBull -  these platforms do not allows Over The Counter (“OTC”) trading, which locks out retail investors. How many people are willing to open a fidelity or thinkorswim account just to buy some cannabis? Less than 1% if I had to estimate. \n\nMoral of the story is that when cannabis becomes legal on the federal level or at least a SAFE banking act is enacted, multiples will stay low until they explode. Federal legalization will be the ultimate driver of multiple explanation. While now democrats are busy passing debt legislation what easier route can they take to grow their approvals by a few percent than legalizing cannabis? Reminder: Bidens approvals rating dipped to 42-44% based on most recent polls. \n\nThesis: **cannabis companies now are not able to access debt or equity financing like normal companies can, driving the multiples way below industry averages especially when accounted for growth**\n\nEnd of story - as I said before, I give zero fucks if you invest in this market - but I personally think this is a truly fantastic opportunity that lets me or you buy in for cheap. As somewhat of an insider in the industry I think cannabis has way more room for growth and what anyone sees right now is a tip of the iceberg.",
