Home Depot said transactions slipped during the period, while the average ticket rose, primarily as a result of inflation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Earnings per share: $5.05 vs. $4.94 expected\n* Revenue: $43.79 billion vs. $43.36 billion expected\n\nHome Depot continued its streak of beating analyst forecasts with record quarterly results for Q2. The home improvement retailer has topped quarterly earnings estimates since the first quarter of 2020, and hasn't missed revenue predictions since Q3 2019. Home Depot stock is down about 25% for the year, and its shares are up about 5% in morning trading.\n\nThe second quarter is seasonally the strongest for wholesale building retailers as home projects pick up in the summer months. Wall Street predicts moderate earnings growth for the two companies. But analysts note concerns over a weakening macro backdrop, slowing \"do-it-yourself\" demand and general retail weakness.",
