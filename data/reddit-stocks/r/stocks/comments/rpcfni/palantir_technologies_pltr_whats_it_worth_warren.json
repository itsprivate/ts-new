As one of the [Paypal Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia)'s creations, Palantir Technologies (\"Palantir\", \"PLTR\" or the \"Company\") originated from fighting fraud at Paypal using in-house analytical tools and human analysts to interpret big data. Paypal Mafia companies have performed well to say the least, including Tesla, LinkedIn, Yelp, YouTube, and others. Hopefully this post will help you determine whether you think PLTR will end up in the same conversation.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nPalantir Technologies, Inc. builds software platforms for institutions. The Company operates through two segments, Commercial and Government. The Company has built two software platforms, Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry. The Gotham software platform is constructed for analysts at defense and intelligences agencies. It enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps the United States and allied military personnel. The Foundry software platform creates a central operating system for organization’s data where individual users can integrate and analyze the data. \n\n*Palantir analyzes big data and uses software to gather and process information that can identify connections, patterns, and trends. The main purpose is for organizations to make better decisions.*\n\n[Summary of software platforms](https://imgur.com/a/EITlahN)\n\n[Go-To-Market Strategy &amp; Select Customers](https://imgur.com/a/PBbxckm)\n\n[Financial Snapshot](https://imgur.com/a/T4OqJgH)\n\n**Key Management**\n\nAlexander Karp, CEO/Co-Founder\n\nPeter Thiel, Chairman/Co-Founder\n\nStephen Cohen, President/Co-Founder\n\nShyam Sankar, COO\n\n**History**\n\n* Paypal dealt with credit card fraud and created software to identify suspicious activity on their platform\n* Peter Thiel challenged Alexander Karp and Stephen Cohen to engineer a system to identify terrorist networks and financial fraud\n* The Company believes their software can stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in financial markets, etc.\n* In 2020, Palantir went public via a direct listing at a $16.0B valuation\n* The Company plans to continue its growth domestically and internationally, but also across segments into the commercial space\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nPalantir believes its total addressable market (TAM) to be approximately $119.0B, accounting for all countries and companies where it is willing to sell its software. This estimate is arrived at by multiplying the number of potential customers ($56B, 6,000 commercial companies with over $500MM in revenue) and Government agencies that align with liberal democracies ($63B)\n\n**Preliminary Risks**\n\n* Security risks related to Government customers and information leaks that could damage the Company’s reputation\n* Customer concentrations: The top 20 customers represented 61% of 2020 revenue; The top 3 customers accounted for 25% of 2020 revenue. Existing customers account for a large portion of revenue and therefore any termination of contracts may have a substantial impact on revenue\n* AI and Big Data are relatively new industries with intense competition\n* Customer contract terms and agreements. The majority of contracts may be terminated by the customer at any time\n* Potential decline in US or other Government budgets, spending, priorities that may cause delays or unrealized value of customer contracts\n* High revenue growth trajectory may be unsustainable given sales efforts and seasonality in projects or budgets\n\n**Q3 Results &amp; Commentary**\n\n* Revenue increased by $102.8 million, or 36%, for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020\n* Revenue from Government increased by 34% and Commercial increased by 37% from Q3 2020\n* Cost of Revenue decreased by 42% for Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020\n* Sales &amp; Marketing expenses decreased by 54% and R&amp;D expenses decreased by 70% from Q3 2020\n* Palantir continues to see high growth, expecting 30%+ revenue growth for 2021 and the next four years through 2025\n\n**Income Statement Projections / Assumptions** [(here)](https://imgur.com/a/rFsBecz)\n\n* Sales: 30-40% growth per year 2021E - 2024E, 10-20% growth per year 2025E - 2030E\n\n*Additional Commentary:*\n\n1. Conservative estimates based on the Company’s 2021 Revenue Guidance of 30%+ through the next four years\n2. Average customer revenue was $7.9MM in 2020 and $7.0MM in LTM 9/30/21 Palantir benefited from increases in Government budgeting and spending, and growth in commercial customers\n3. Covid-19 resulted in more contracts in healthcare, including a contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n* Gross Margin: 77.5% - 82.0% as a % of Sales 2021 - 2030\n* EBITDA Margin: Expansion from (28.4%) - 52.8% as a % of Sales  2021 - 2030\n* Depreciation &amp; Amortization: In line with historicals\n* Interest Expense and Other: Palantir paid down its debt in 2021\n\n**Discounted Cash Flow Analysis** [(here)](https://imgur.com/a/3LEjm6t)\n\nPLTR doesn’t have any debt as of 9/30/2021\n\n* Estimated Equity Value based on 9/30/2021 10-Q Balance Sheet\n* Weighted Average Cost of Capital based on conservative estimates for cost of equity given the uncertainty of cash flows and industry risks\n* Cost of Equity: 10.0%\n* Terminal Value Growth Rate: 3.0% based on US GDP estimates\n* Enterprise Value: $30,130.7MM\n* Equity Value: $32,613.8MM\n* Share Outstanding (in millions): 1,906.59\n* ANALYST ”Street”  CONSENSUS ESTIMATED SHARE PRICE: $25.00\n* BASE CASE ESTIMATED SHARE PRICE:  **$17.11** \n\n**Outlook &amp; Final Thoughts**\n\nBased on these growth expectations and dilutive effects of stock based compensation, Palantir is **slightly overvalued/fairly valued** at **$18.93 as of 12/23/21 close**. This may change  in the future given the variance in the Company’s cash flows, growth prospects, research &amp; development, new products, average revenue per customer, compensation structures, and overall industry growth. \n\nI personally like PLTR as a long term portfolio hold because of **two main reasons**. First, I believe in **Alexander Karp as a founder and his vision**. You can see his passion for the company and its product. Palantir doesn't have a sales team and solely relies on developing world-class products to attract customers. Secondly, the **total addressable market size is massive**. Although Palantir is a B2B model, I believe they can eventually compete with companies like that of salesforce or other enterprise platform systems. Lastly, I will add that the #1 risk to equity holders is the dilution of shareholders through stock based compensation; however, it is likely to diminish in future years and should be treated as an \"expense\" for acquiring talented employees. I'd recommend watching Alex Karp interviews and Palantir's YouTube videos for more information.\n\n*Sources:  Palantir Technologies, Inc. 2020 10-K Annual Report (SEC Website), Palantir Technologies, Inc. 3rd Qtr 2021 10-Q and Investor Presentations, Palantir Technologies, Inc. 2020 Annual 10-K and Investor Presentations, Palantir Technologies, Inc.
