We are so grateful for everything they have done for Netflix and are working hard to support them through this difficult transition.”\n\nNetflix had warned investors in April that it would be pulling back on some of its spending growth over the next two years.\n\nSpencer Neumann, the company’s chief financial officer, said during the company’s earnings call that Netflix is trying to be “prudent” about pulling back to to reflect the realities of its business. The company still plans to invest heavily, including around $17 billion on content.\n\nCo-CEO Reed Hastings also said during the call that the company is exploring lower-priced, ad-supported tiers in a bid to bring in new subscribers after years of resisting advertisements on the platform.\n\nNetflix is working to crack down on rampant password sharing as well. The company said that in addition to its 222 million paying households, more than 100 million households use its service through account sharing.\n\nShares of the company were down less than a percent during midday trading Thursday, but are down more around 70% since January.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/23/netflix-lays-off-300-more-employees-as-revenue-growth-continues-to-slow.html)",
