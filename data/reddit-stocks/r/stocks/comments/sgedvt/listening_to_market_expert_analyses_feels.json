But what you get once you distill it all is this:\n\n&gt; if [condition] then [something happens]\n\nwhere the condition is something you cannot predict. So in principle, their \"prediction\" comes down to \"if prices go up then they go up\". One example for all:\n\n&gt; \"... &lt;verbiage&gt; in case Russia invades Ukraine, &lt;jargon&gt; we can expect a more risk averse approach and therefore further drop in prices, &lt;more verbiage and jargon&gt;\"\n\nHowever, since there is no way to predict whether the invasion will happen, this prediction is totally empty of any useful information. It is equivalent to saying \"in case prices drop they drop\", because of course once the information is out that the invasion happened, the market will react much faster than we can act on it.\n\nDo you also have similar experience with reading expert analyses/predictions/opinions? Do you even feel like it makes sense to listen to them? How do you use them?",
