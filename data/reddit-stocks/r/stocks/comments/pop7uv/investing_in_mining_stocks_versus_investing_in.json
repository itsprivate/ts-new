Someone told me that it is better to invest in the mining companies themselves over the stocks especially if I don’t really have much knowledge on metals.\n\nWhen I first invested, I decided to diversify and try to get the senior ones like FCX which is obviously a great value stock, with it being one of the bigger players in mining. Their stocks have risen 1.16% in premarket trading.\n\nI also have some Anglo American, which is estimated to hold 898 million tonnes (Mt) of proven ore reserves, grading 0.58% of copper and containing 5,209 kilo tonne (Kt) of copper, as of December 2017. Their probable ore reserves were estimated to be 435Mt grading 0.54% of copper and containing 2.35Mt of copper.\n\nThere are also some juniors that I decided on, but I only got two since my goal is to diversify. One stock I got is from Lundin Gold. They are concentrated on the Fruta Del Norte gold mine in the country. There was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, but they recently announced the production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year.\n\nI also decided to invest in Solaris Resources ([SLSSF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/)), which boasts their Warintza project and just released reports from their maiden drilling at El Trinche. It seems like the Ecuadorian president considers them as a favorite since he touted the company’s Warintza Project during an interview on national television before the election.\n\nI need your thoughts. I know I have invested in some mining stocks but I want to know which one is really better to invest in.",
