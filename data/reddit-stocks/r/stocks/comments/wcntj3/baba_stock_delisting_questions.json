  "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI own BABA and have a number of questions around this potential de-listing. I hope it is appropriate for this sub (since it is stocks) and hoping this will help anyone else in my shoes.\n\n1. When a company is de-listed from a stock exchange does it's value fall to zero?\n2. China has announced that BABA may potentially have a dual-primary listing in HK? What are the implications? Can i simply transfer my shares from US to HK? (I have trading permissions on  HKEX)\n3. Since the US stock (BABA) is an ADR and the HK stock (9988) is a secondary listing, are there any implications for this transfer or is it as simple as moving from one exchange to the other by the broker(like IBKR)?\n4. The current BABA price is USD 89. The current 9988 price in HKEX is 89 HKD. However, 1 USD = 7.85 HKD. If i have 100 BABA shares do they get transferred as 100 shares of 9988 or will FX be taken into account? (If FX is not taken into account, then the value of my shares will reduce by 7.85 since the price is roughly equal)\n\nLike a lot of BABA shareholders (bagholders?) i am very worried and want to know the implications before i decide to cut my losses and sell it off. The other option is to not look at news and HODL!!! or play the \"chicken\" game but this is a good opportunity to learn about de-listing and share transfer. \n\nIf any of you are knowledgeable about this, i really could use your help.\n\nThank you in advance!",
