NET's revenue growth has been constant around 50% for several years. Management actually guided down to 37% for the next quarter but most people seem to have dismissed? What is the market pricing in? I get \"work from home\" and internet focus but why has Cloudflare's stock done much better despite growth near or below others (lack of direct competitor?) in space and consistent losses?\n2. ZS Rev growth seemed to slow but is back up around 60%. What happened? What is the biggest risk to these stocks more broadly?\n3. Broadly how to think of these stocks?\n4. Considering I plan to keep FTNT, would NET be the best addition to balance out?",
