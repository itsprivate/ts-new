I just ran some data, and this is what I found.\n\nWeight-adjusted, half of the index's losses were accounted for by four components:\n\n* Microsoft ($MSFT) -10.74%\n* Amazon ($AMZN) -12.5%\n* NVIDIA ($NVDA) -21.55%\n* Alphabet Inc ($GOOGL) -7.65%\n\nI decided to look deeper.  I studied companies that are not profitable or had a P/E ratio greater than 45.  Weight-adjusted, the companies lost an average of -15.3%.  The remaining components, those that were profitable and had more reasonable valuations lost an average of -3.59%.\n\nNone of this is surprising.  The higher quality companies have averaged a better annual return, than the rest by a huge margin (15.84% v. 10.44%) since 1999.  For the worst periods since 2000, the story is more telling.\n\nDuring the Tech Bubble (2000-2002), the higher quality companies averaged a loss of -9.12% per year.  The less attractive companies average a loss of -36.86% per year.\n\nA similar story can be told during The Great Recession.  When the financial crisis started on October 9, 2007, the less attractive companies averaged a total loss of -63.92%, while the more reasonably priced companies limited their total losses to -52.11%.  Note:  For those who don't remember, The Great Recession was a total washout for many.\n\nThe point I am making is that if one wants to limit their losses and increase their opportunities to earn a profit, they should invest in quality companies, and stay away from overpriced garbage.",
