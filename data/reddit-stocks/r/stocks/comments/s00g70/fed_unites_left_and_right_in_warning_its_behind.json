That would top November’s 6.8% annual rise and be the largest increase since 1982.\n\nHere are some of the points on inflation and the Fed made by a number of well-known economists in panels at the AEA conference:\n\nFurman, a Harvard University professor, said he expects inflation to remain elevated this year, with a mean forecast of 3.2% for the core personal consumption expenditures price index. That’s above the median 2.7% forecast of Fed policy makers at their Dec. 14-15 meeting. \n\nMeanwhile, Furman saw a 15% chance that inflation will come in higher this year than last. He also averred that the three nominees that Biden is reportedly considering for the central bank’s board “are considerably more dovish than anyone who’s been on the Fed” for a long time.\n\nTaylor, whose monetary-policy rule has been a guidepost for central banks worldwide for years, said the Fed is “way behind” the curve. Depending on the assumptions made, he suggested the federal funds rate should be anywhere from 3% to 6%, not the near-zero percent level now targeted by the central bank. \n\nNoting that yields on Treasury securities jumped last week, the Stanford University professor predicted seeing “more of that down the road.”\n\nSummers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg, also foresees Treasury yields rising further. \n\n“As the reality of the need for balancing supply and demand becomes clear, interest rates will rise substantially over the next year and a half,” he said. \n\nSummers got into a spirited back-and-forth with Stiglitz at the conference, arguing that the Columbia University professor was placing too much emphasis on supply-chain kinks for the run-up in prices. \n\nGregory Mankiw, who was chief White House economist for Republican President George W. Bush, said “a lot” of the increase in inflation could be blamed on temporary dislocations in supply. “We also have a very tight labor market and you’re starting to see it in wage growth,” he said. \n\nThe Harvard professor, who is now a self-described political independent because of opposition to former President Donald Trump, said that although inflation isn’t going to stay at 7%, he’d be “surprised” if it falls back to 2% very quickly.\n\nFormer Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder said he still counts himself as a member of “Team Transitory” in the debate over inflation. \n\nBut Blinder, who served in the White House under Clinton and now teaches at Princeton University, has said it could take some time for “bottleneck inflation” to ease. Fed policy makers have been slow to recognize the bubbling price pressures in their forecasts, he’s added.\n\nThe soft landing that Powell and his central bank colleagues are trying to engineer for the economy “will require the Fed to be both lucky and smart,” Hubbard told the conference. \n\nPointing to inflationary pressures from rising rents and home prices and increasing wages, the Columbia University professor doubted whether the three quarter-percentage-point rate increases Fed policy makers have penciled in for this year will be enough.",
