We are supposed to be a sub that talks about stocks. Why can&#39;t we just sticky a post that states that stocks go down as well as up and that a red day doesn&#39;t mean anything and be done with it?\nHalf the subs in this post aren&#39;t even about a stock anymore. Between that and the constant pump and dumps from WSBs we aren&#39;t a fraction of the sub we was before covid.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else feel this way? Or do you enjoy the daily reassurance posts for when a stock you own goes down one percent after going up 200 percent this year?</p>\n\n<p>Worst part is that the posts reassuring people are always based of nothing from bag holders from pump and dump posts. BB is up an obscene amount. No it&#39;s not going back up to 25 dollars anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p>Pump and dumps have left us with tons of bag holders and now they all constantly make posts to help themselves and others hold the bags based on zero evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t wait for all the triggered BB holders but it&#39;s just an example of a Wsb pump and dumped that&#39;s screwed half the sub over that now gets a daily cry post</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
