Now, I have unrealized loss of as much as $45k. I felt very dumb and greedy for putting so much money to stocks and not taking more profits last year. Now, I am worried and scared of further unrealized loss. I tried not to look at my portfolio few times a week, but it’s hard not to.\n\nAny good tips for staying calm during this volatile market? Do you think the stocks can go back up in the second half of this year?\n\nThank you.",
