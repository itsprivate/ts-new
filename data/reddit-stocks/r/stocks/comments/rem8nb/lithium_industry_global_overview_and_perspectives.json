I also believe that, amid growing concerns over the Omicron variant and faster-than-expected tapering, here is now the best period to get knowledge about secular growth and megatrends, and position\n\nI’ve been interested in this industry since early 2021 and I found it appealing from both a top-down and bottom-up perspectives. I will not share any view on specific stocks but I must report that I do own shares in Albemarle and SQM since early 2021.\n\n# Actors\n\n* **Lithium Producers**: Ganfeng, Tianqi Lithium, Albemarle, SQM, Livent, Orocobre, Lithium Americas\n* **Spodumene\\* Producers**: Pilbara, Mineral Resources, etc..\n* **Tons of small-cap “emerging projects”**: Piedmont Lithium, Ioneer, Neo Lithium, Bacanora Lithium, Savannah Resources, etc..\n\nThe five first mentioned lithium producers above account for 80% of the annual global production of lithium.\n\n\\* raw resource mined to produce lithium carbonate or hydroxide\n\n# Global Environment\n\n* Climate change requires the global ramp up of electrification across a wide range of carbon-based sectors, including **transportation responsible for 16.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions** in 2016 (World Resources Institute, 2020).  Lithium is an essential component of this shift thanks to its electrical properties.\n* Traditional market usage and accelerating EV adoption, coupled with growing charging infrastructure and government support, are placing inevitable strain upon the lithium supply chain.\n* China is dominating the global share of conversion facilities and battery production. Over reliance on other countries leaves the USA and Europe at a significant risk to achieving an independent sustainable energy future. It will lead to investment opportunities for lithium producers with conversion capabilities and battery producers located in the USA/Europe.\n\n# Drivers, Expectations and Opportunities\n\n* Primary driver of lithium demand is EV demand, itself driven by:\n   * Regulatory framework, government incentives and strong OEMs commitments\n   * Growing charging infrastructure and improving battery technology with full manufacturing cost parity with combustion engine cars to be reached by 2025-26\n   * 2020 vs. 2030e vs. 2040e global new EV sales market penetration: 4% vs. &gt;40% vs. &gt;70%. EV were 7.2% of total passenger car sales in 2Q 2021\n* Increased global energy storage needs with global energy storage installations expected to increase 20x between 2020 and 2030\n* Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan with $7.5 billion for both EV charging infrastructure and electric buses + Complementary package of $1.75-$2 trillion in climate policy (and safety net) currently discussed\n* **Lithium industry demand markets CAGR by 2025: \\~+30% / \\~+20% from 2025 to 2030**\n* Opportunities for Europe and the US to develop both upstream and downstream capabilities. Right now, China roughly processes &gt;80% of world’s lithium hydroxide (from spodumene/carbonate), controls 77% of the cell capacity and 60% of the component manufacturing worldwide\n\n# Headwinds\n\n* Capital-intensive business and long term commitment of capital (between 6 and 10 years for a brown/green field project to be up and commercially running)\n* Supply chain risks with labor shortages due to external/internal factors such as COVID-19, employee strikes, working conditions, etc..\n* Changes in local regulation and company’s inability to find common ground with local governments (Chile, Australia, Argentina)\n* Increased environmental requirements\n* Volatile nature and current sustainability of lithium prices, highly dependent on the transportation sector’s demand\n* Lithium production must pass a qualification process. Only lithium of the highest quality (battery-grade) can be used for batteries which encourage clients to work with established producers\n* To a lesser extent:\n   * Changes in demand for a specific type of lithium (carbonate/hydroxide/metals)\n   * Changes in battery technology and lithium extraction technology\n   * Lithium recycling\n\nAfter some research, here are potential answers to some headwinds mentioned above:\n\n**Lithium Price Sustainability and Impact on Producers**\n\nLithium pricing has rallied more than **300% YTD on average**, with carbonate and hydroxide now trading **above $33'000 a metric ton in the Chinese spot market**, while the historical EV demand period in November/December did not materialize yet. Contrary to 2017-2018, demand for lithium is expected to outstrip production for at least the next five years with few new mining projects on the horizon. Therefore, it raises the question of price sustainability over time and the impact on the expected EV price parity with ICEs to be reached in 2025-2026.\n\nAn argument in favor of pricing going down in the coming years is the **expected increased competition leading to additional supply over time**. At the current levels, every lithium project is profitable and an industry growing 25-30% with EBTIDA margins close to 35%-40% should attract competition. The risk of lithium oversupply in the future with additional supply coming faster-than-expected should not be overlooked. Nevertheless, even with prices going down and reaching more sustainable levels around $12’000-$14’000, they will remain well above the contract prices currently negotiated between lithium producers and their customers.\n\nFor instance, SQM reported recently its 3Q21 results and mentioned that most of their lithium contracts would be renegotiated over 4Q21/2022. The Co guided to a +50% price increase in 4Q21, from $8’200/t in 3Q21, and an even higher price increase over 2022.\n\nAdditionally, it is worth noting the pricing model of lithium producers. Most of them are using a hybrid model where 70-80% of the contracts have embedded fixed prices while the rest is based on variable prices. They are negotiated over 3-5 years on average, implying a lag between spot pricing and contract pricing. With the sharpe increase in lithium spot price, lithium outlook and the urgent need for their clients to secure enough supply (whatever the cost?), producers are now in a superior position where they can negotiate a hybrid model with 1. a much higher embedded fixed price and 2. more contracts based on spot price, further improving margins.\n\n**Battery Technology**\n\nBattery chemistry is in constant evolution and is a key driver for carbonate, hydroxide or lithium metals demand shift. Whilst the market was expecting lithium hydroxide to become more dominant because of its higher density property, we observed over the last few months the resurgence of LFP batteries and, consequently, the surge in demand for lithium carbonate. It explains somehow the current discount of lithium hydroxide vs. carbonate in the Chinese spot market.\n\nAccording to OEMs statements, demand for carbonate, hydroxide or lithium metals will be dependent on OEMs targeted markets with China/Europe supporting demand for carbonate and the USA preferring hydroxide. **Lithium producers**, like Albermarle, **able to produce lithium carbonate and having downstream processing capabilities to produce lithium hydroxide will definitely have an edge here thanks to their flexibility.**\n\n**Increased ESG, global supply chain disruptions and labor shortages**\n\nThe lithium industry is facing challenges from increased ESG requirements. Many producers already committed to reduce their water consumption over time but more efforts could be expected from OEMs to end-users, leading to additional costs. Requirements for a “greener a cleaner” lithium production are likely to intensify in the coming years, especially if the EV industry wants to prove it is effectively cleaner than ICE vehicles. Here again, I do believe there are opportunities for both the US and Europe to develop both upstream and downstream capabilities as local supply chains mean lower carbon footprint.\n\nThe industry is also not immune to supply chain risks and suffered recently from COVID-19 issues and labor shortages. Supply chain risks are the biggest challenge currently faced right now, according to Albemarle, as producers must take care of delivering the products on time.\n\nThe vaccination rollout, despite the Omicron variant virus, should ease the strain on the supply chain over time.\n\n**Alternative lithium extraction: DLE**\n\nDirect Lithium extraction is an innovative environmentally-friendly technology working as a substitute of lithium production from brines with evaporation ponds. It presents many advantages, including global costs, strong reduction in water usage, and bringing at a **much faster pace battery grade lithium to markets**. However, **the DLE solution cannot be implemented everywhere**. The technology still has to prove itself and should be seen as a complementary solution to produce lithium carbonate.\n\n**Recycling**\n\nRecycling has been a focus area within the lithium industry because we believe the environmental footprint of recycling is less important than directly mining lithium or producing it through brine. However, recycling is highly dependent on the lifespan of EVs batteries, currently estimated to be around 10 to 15 years. Lithium coming from recycling would therefore ramp up in 2030-2035.\n\nHere are my findings/research, I hope it will help you getting a better overview of this industry and catching potential opportunities. I do believe climate change is full of opportunities and lithium is one of them. There are plenty of ways to play this thematic, from lithium producers to companies dedicated to recycling. Investing in EV producers is another solution but I find it very difficult to pick the EV producer that will prevail in the coming years.\n\nLooking forward to discussing with you your views on the lithium industry! Cheers!",
