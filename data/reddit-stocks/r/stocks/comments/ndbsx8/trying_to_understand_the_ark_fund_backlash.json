Growth stocks as a whole have been taking a hit. The ARK Funds are described on their website as “ETFs focused on disruptive innovation”. This alone says ARK is bit of a risk and will focus on companies replacing the status quo. That may take some time. I do believe it will happen though. Take ARKF, for instance, she’s not going to go and invest in a company that prints out paper checks or manufactures atm cards. Square, Shopify, Zillow are a few of the top holdings. Obviously, each has seen incredible growth. They may taking a hit now but may represent the status quo in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Also, other fintech etfs have suffered the same fate recently. Others may not have fallen so far but that seems to be because they weren’t as successful during the big run up late last year</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a novice investor and I’m genuinely curious as to what she could have done differently. Is it how certain companies were weighted in the funds? Or did she just choose the wrong companies?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
