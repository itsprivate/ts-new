Nvidia said that more than 70 laptop manufacturers would offer gaming laptops that use the company’s next-generation Ampere architecture. Nvidia said its new gaming laptops would be priced at $999 for the RTX 3060 model, $1,299 for the RTX 3070 model, and $1,999 for the RTX 3080 model.</p>\n\n<p>As many gamers found this past holiday season, however, those list prices were pretty much meaningless as resellers scooped up available RTX 30-series cards and sold them at much higher prices, and remaining 30-series cards were only available from manufacturers who were bundling the cards into pre-made gaming rigs. Supply problems were so bad, especially as many new games that required fast hardware were released, that even Nvidia’s older 20-series generation of cards saw significant markups from resellers.</p>\n\n<p>This new product launch, however, should be a little easier given that laptop chips make better use of constrained foundry resources, Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told MarketWatch in an interview.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
