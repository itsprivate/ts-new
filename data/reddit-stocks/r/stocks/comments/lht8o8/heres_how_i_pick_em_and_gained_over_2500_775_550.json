Remember that mainstream media has its own agenda and the CEO or hedge fund manager being interviewed is typically only there to benefit themselves.</p>\n\n<p>I start looking for sectors with potential price movement based on the direction I think the world is going and come up with trade ideas which will later be used as a starting point for due diligence.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>EXAMPLE 1: News reports about climate change. Democratic leader Joe Biden becomes president and has made climate change a priority. Biden wants to increase jobs and green technologies. Automotive manufacturers to start producing more electric vehicles.  </p>\n\n<p>POTENTIAL TRADE IDEA: Long EV car production. Short oil.  </p>\n\n<p>EXAMPLE 2: Frequent news reports about pandemic. People stay at home instead of going to the workplace.  </p>\n\n<p>POTENTIAL TRADE IDEA: Long remote working, DIY home renovation. Short travel, hotel, cruise.  </p>\n\n<p>EXAMPLE 3: Recurring news reports about companies getting hacked which leads to more businesses being concerned about their digital security.  </p>\n\n<p>POTENTIAL TRADE IDEA: Long security companies. Short company that got hacked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>The trick is to get really good at the skill of understanding what&#39;s going on but isn&#39;t being widely discussed yet. Do this by consuming lots of information from a variety of sources to the point where a logical conclusion or prediction can be made about what is likely to happen in the future within a specific sector and time frame.</em></p>\n\n<p>Not all the information consumed should be via media. Before covid a great technique was to simply take note of which stores are extraordinarily busy at the shopping mall and ask why is this store busy but not that one?</p>\n\n<p>Another great way to discover new stocks is to talk with industry experts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I remember chatting with a friend way back in 2009 who worked in marketing for a digital agency and they kept talking about this cool new tool called Salesforce because of how much it&#39;s helped them with their job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After identifying a potential stock or sector that interests me, I&#39;ll start looking for top performing ETFs within the same sector. Then inside those ETFs I&#39;ll look for the top 3 names that frequently appear inside those ETFs. Sometimes the ETF itself is the best decision, sometimes it&#39;s not.</p>\n\n<p>For each of those top 3 I&#39;ll look at their annual reports.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do they have revenue? Why not?</li>\n<li>Is revenue rising or falling quarterly? How about annually?</li>\n<li>Do they have debt?</li>\n<li>Is debt rising or falling?</li>\n<li>Does leadership have years of relevant experience?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Next I&#39;ll look at the chart as zoomed out as it can go. What&#39;s the trend? Up, flat, down?</p>\n\n<p>Then I&#39;ll zoom in the chart notch by notch looking for the trend. Annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, 30mins, 15mins, 5mins, 1min.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I buy when I&#39;ve identified potential price movement, the price is low, and is hovering around a level that has support.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I sell when I need the cash to invest in something else or when I no longer believe in the future of the company or sector.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t pay attention to anybody pumping a stock with emojis. Why? Because emojis are used to represent emotion and if you make an investment or trade decision based on emotion or hype you&#39;re doing it wrong and in most cases are probably too late anyways.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>tldr;</p>\n\n<p>Spend 80% of your &quot;investing time&quot; coming up with original trade ideas and 20% on technicals and charts when you execute the trade.</p>\n\n<p>If you aren&#39;t trading with your own ideas and instead choose to follow someone else&#39;s buy recommendation then I hate to break it to you, but you&#39;ll probably end up buying into someone else&#39;s exit strategy and become a bag holder for days, weeks, months or even years to come just waiting for that big turnaround day which may never come.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
