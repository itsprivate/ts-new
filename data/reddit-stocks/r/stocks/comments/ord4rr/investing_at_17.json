I saved up an emergency fund with 1,000$ (in a savings account) \n\nNext paycheck I would like to put 20% into saving, 20% for personal use, and 60% for investing. Since I do not need to pay for essentials on my own yet I have the luxury of being able invest a larger portion of my paycheck in stocks.\n\nSo here is where I have some grey areas. \n1) I do not have a PC and I live in a very rural area (my town has 800 people in it and all the surrounding towns as well) and so it seems the best place to use for investing is Robinhood. I’ve heard great things about it except they are all paid ads. \n2) The first bank I used was all connected with my Dad and my grandparents and because I do not want them to have access to my finances once I’m 18 I started my own savings account at a separate bank. Although I have a savings account I am unable to open a checking account until I am 18. Will using a savings account to transfer money be fine? And if I transfer larger sums of money (I only mean like 2-5k) will the bank be suspicious (like I said I live In the rural Midwest and so the banks are also very small)\n\nAny other advice would be great. I’ve taken a few finance classes and have done some mock investing but they never really discussed where to go if you want to actually buy stocks. \nThanks!",
