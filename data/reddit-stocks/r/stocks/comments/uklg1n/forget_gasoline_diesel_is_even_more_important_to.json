There I summarized historic drawdowns in inventories, most pronounced in crude oil and distillates (including jet fuel, diesel). Gasoline was relatively okay.\n\nThis post will focus on developments in distillates, primarily diesel. The picture is getting much, much worse.\n\nFor a broad overview of diesel, [start with this CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/07/diesel-fuel-is-in-short-supply-as-prices-surge-heres-what-that-means-for-inflation.html). You can also check out this Bloomberg Opinion [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-04/u-s-east-coast-diesel-supply-is-running-on-fumes?), which writes \"The surging price of the fuel spells trouble for the global economy.\"\n\n&gt; U.S. distillate inventory is now at the lowest level in more than decade. The move is even more extreme on the East Coast, where stockpiles are at the lowest since 1996. Diesel and jet fuel at New York harbor are now trading well above $200 per barrel, according to UBS.\n\nGraph 1: [Graphs of diesel inventories](https://i.imgur.com/yz84a9i.png) compared to past years.\n\nMeanwhile, refining closures have accelerated in the past 3 decades, ([Graph 2](https://i.imgur.com/LPFJ4Uc.png)).\n\nAs a consequence, the margin to produce diesel from crude oil is hitting all time highs, as [Graph 3](https://i.imgur.com/eba8f09.png) shows. This effect is global, as [Graph 4](https://i.imgur.com/QaluLDs.png) displays  the margins across regions. Simultaneously, the premium of diesel over gasoline is skyrocketing ([Graph 5](https://i.imgur.com/5dtlLMg.png)).\n\nHere is what diesel prices are looking like: [Graph 6](https://i.imgur.com/mPhnDaH.png), for the ultra-sulphur variety (a type increasingly required by regulators for its lower carbon emissions). You can read more about these regulations [here](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/diesel-fuel/), where it states, \"Diesel fuel now sold in the United States for on-highway use is ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD).\" \n\nWhy is diesel so important in particular? From the same source,\n\n&gt; Most freight and delivery trucks as well as trains, buses, boats, and farm, construction, and military vehicles, and some cars and light trucks have diesel engines. Diesel fuel is also used in diesel-engine generators to generate electricity, such as in remote villages in Alaska, among other locations around the world. Many industrial facilities, large buildings, institutional facilities, hospitals, and electric utilities have diesel generators for backup and emergency power supply.\n\nNow, I mentioned that the problem was across all distillates. What are distillates? \n\n&gt;Technically, a distillate is a product obtained from the condensation of vapors during a distillation process. In this sense, most petroleum products – gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene and jet fuel–are, to some degree, distillates. The process by which they are produced involves heating crude oil and allowing it to rise in a tower-like chamber. Vapor thus created condenses at various levels in the tower, and the liquid is drawn off.\n\n&gt; In petroleum marketing, however, the term distillate is reserved for products in the middle distillation range. These products include heating oils and diesel fuel. The main distillate classifications are Nos. 1, 2, and 4 fuel oils, and Nos. 1, 2, and 4 diesel fuels. Kerosene is also a distillate, similar to No. 1 oils, but is often listed separately for statistical purposes. \n\nHere is how jet fuel, an example of a distillate, is behaving relative to crude oil: [Graph 7](https://i.imgur.com/T4rUZeK.png).\n\nAre we seeing the effects yet? In the trucking industry, [it's not so clear](https://www.overdriveonline.com/equipment/article/15291509/truck-orders-other-metrics-suggest-market-strength-despite-strong-headwinds). There are more cancellations in truck orders, but it's really just orders being swapped for others.\n\nOn the other hand, we are seeing more of this: \"Local Nigerian airlines argue will stop flying their domestic routes indefinitely from Monday after spike in jet-fuel prices — emerging markets are getting priced out as refined oil product prices skyrocket.\" [Sourced from Guardian](https://twitter.com/MaleMosesSyza/status/1523019975165988864).\n\nWhat will happen to gasoline as a result? Yes, gasoline is doing a lot better as Graph 5 shows, but producers will switch to refining diesel over gasoline temporarily due to the margins. This will eventually overcorrect and there will be shortages of gasoline. \n\nThe full album of graphs are stored [here](https://imgur.com/a/k6ImJ3J).\n\nTL;DR: Diesel is entering crisis mode.\n\n**Question to you all**: What stocks does this have implications for?",
