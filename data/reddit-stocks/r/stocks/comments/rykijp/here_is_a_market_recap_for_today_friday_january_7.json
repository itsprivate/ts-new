The Nasdaq (QQQ) suffered its worst week since February 2021.\n\n**Notable Numbers**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.40%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.08%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.02%\n* Russel 2000 (IWM): -1.16%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -4.33%\n* 10yr Treasury Yield: 1.77%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -3.54%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): -3.32%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): +9.84%\n* Discovery (DISCA): +16.87%\n* Gamestop (GME): +7.32%\n\nThe Labor Department’s December jobs report released this morning showed the US added a disappointing 199,000 in December, coming in way below expectations and an unexpected slowdown compared to the previous month. \n\nOther metrics, however, were more upbeat, as the unemployment rate improved to a fresh pandemic-era low of 3.9%, and the labor force participation rate steadied after an upward revision in November. Still, many economists cautioned that a more recent hit to the labor market from the surge in Omicron cases may not yet have been. captured in the December report. \n\nBy industry, some of the services-related sectors hardest-hit initially by the pandemic saw muted hiring at the end of December. Leisure and hospitality jobs rose by 53,000 in the last month of the year, rising compared to November's gain of 41,000, but coming in well below the 211,000 seen in October. \n\nOther industries saw a deceleration in hiring in December. Transportation and warehousing jobs rose by just under 19,000 during the month after a rise of more than 42,000 in November, while professional and business services positions rose by 43,000 after a gain of 72,000 during the prior month. Education and health services employment gains totaled 10,000, slowing from 14,000 in the prior period. Meanwhile, retail trade employers shed jobs for a back-to-back month. \n\nHere are the numbers:\n\n* **Non-farm payrolls:** \\+199,000 vs. +450,000 expected and a revised +249,000 in November\n* **Unemployment rate:** 3.9% vs. 4.1% expected and 4.2% in November \n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.4% expected and a revised 0.4% in November\n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.7% vs. 4.2% expected and a revised 5.1% in November\n\nMarty Walsh, US Secretary of Labor, said “It's a solid report. Obviously, it didn't hit what the experts had said ... but when you look at 2021 as a combined total, as the president has been sworn into office, passed the American Rescue Plan, 6.4 million jobs have been added, which is a record. There's no question that we still have people out of work, we have people that have left the workforce. We're working on also inflation,\" he added. \"So we do have some work to move forward.\"\n\nComing into the December job report, stocks were already under pressure as market participants digested recent comments from the Federal Reserve, suggesting an interest rate hike could come “soon”. With policymakers closely watching for signs that the economy has reached maximum employment, the jobs report could provide additional fodder for the Fed to double down on its more hawkish tilt. \n\nIn the latest meeting minutes, participants suggested they were inclined to further speed up the pace of tapering and accelerate the timeline to raise interest rates.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, President of Queen’s College at Cambridge University and Allianz Chief Economic Advisor said, “The way I view it is very simple: The Fed delivered a wonderful year for markets in 2021, at the cost of a much more complicated outlook in 2022. And that complicated outlook is for policy, is for the economy, and therefore is a more uncertain outlook for markets. This is still a very robust economy. If we avoid a policy mistake — big if. But if we avoid a policy mistake, this economy has all the ingredients to continue growing and grow in a more inclusive manner. But we do need help on labor force participation and productivity. We do need help on the supply side.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After gapping up more than 30% yesterday after-hours, Gamestop (GME) was unable to hold onto most of the gains, finishing roughly 7% higher.\n* A U.S. appeals court on Friday revived a 2019 shareholder lawsuit filed against Boeing Co (BA) after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people over a five-month period and led to the plane's 20-month grounding.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) both suffered their worst single-week decline since the beginning of the pandemic, with shares falling -5.4% and -6.6% respectively.\n* Mortgage rates rose to their highest level in more than a year and a half after details from the Federal Reserve's last policy-setting meeting released on Wednesday hardened expectations for a higher interest-rate environment.\n* The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped from 3.11% to 3.22% this week, according to Freddie Mac. \n* The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that U.S. factory orders accelerated in November, climbing 1.6% during the month. \n* The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that November's read jumped to a near-record $80.2 billion, 19.3% higher than the October deficit of $67.2 billion and just below the all-time monthly record of $81.4 billion reported in September.\n\n“You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.” *-Dr. Seuss*",
