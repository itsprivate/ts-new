Concerns about fires from Tesla solar systems have been published previously, but this is the first report of investigation by the securities regulator.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed the Tesla probe in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla field quality manager, who filed a whistleblower complaint on the solar systems in 2019 and asked the agency for information about the report.\n\nHenkes, a former Toyota Motor quality division manager, was fired from Tesla in August 2020 and he sued Tesla claiming the dismissal was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. Tesla did not respond to Reuters' emailed questions, while the SEC declined to comment.\n\nIn the SEC complaint, Henkes said Tesla and SolarCity, which it acquired in 2016, did not disclose its \"liability and exposure to property damage, risk of injury of users, fire etc to shareholders\" prior and after the acquisition.\n\nTesla also failed to notify its customers that defective electrical connectors could lead to fires, according to the complaint.\n\nHenkes, in the SEC complaint, said he told Tesla management that Tesla needs to shut down the fire-prone solar systems, report to safety regulators and notify consumers. When his calls were ignored, he proceeded to file complaints with regulators.\n\n\"The top lawyer cautioned any communication of this issue to the public as a detriment to the Tesla reputation. For me this is criminal,\" he said in the SEC complaint.\n\nLitigation and concerns over faulty connectors and Tesla solar system issues stretch back several years. Walmart in a 2019 lawsuit against Tesla said the latter's roof solar system led to seven store fires. Tesla denied the allegations and the two settled.",
