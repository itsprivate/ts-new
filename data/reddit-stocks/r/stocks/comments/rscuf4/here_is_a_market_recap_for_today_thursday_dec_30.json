  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 30, 2021**\n\nAfter starting the day green, stocks closed modestly lower, slipping in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested newly released labor market data and surging coronavirus cases across the world due to the Omicron variant. \n\nGiven we are in the last few session of the year, volume had dried up considerably. For example, in the last four or five trading sessions, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has traded roughly half its average volume. The fact that stocks are holding up so well despite volume drying up is very encouraging going into next year.\n\n**Notable Numbers** \n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.28%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.35%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.24%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.04%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): +2.36%\n* Sea Limited (SE): +4.86%\n* SoFi Technologies: +10.02%\n* Upstart (UPST): +4.97%\n* Affirm (AFRM): +5.63%\n* Biogen (BIIB): -7.09%\n* DraftKings (DKNG): +7.07%\n\nOn Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)\n\nIn response, airlines canceled thousands of flights, both domestic and international, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officially advised people to avoid cruise ships regardless of vaccination status. As a result, both airline and cruise line stocks underperformed the market. On a personal note, after the last two years, I couldn’t get paid to go on a cruise. \n\nDespite this, the CDC eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. \n\nData shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission \"occurs early in the course of illness,\" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.\n\n\"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\n\nIn other news, the Labor Department released its weekly unemployment report, showing initial and continuing jobless claims continue to come in at historic lows, signaling a tight labor market.  First-time unemployment filings fell further from last week’s reading, coming in at 198,000 — below the expected 206,000. Earlier in December, jobless claims fell to 188,000 — its lowest level since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, in a regulatory filing on Thursday, Samsung BioLogics denied earlier reports that Samsung subsidiary was in talks to acquire U.S. drugmaker Biogen (BIIB), which was in the spotlight on Wednesday after shares of the drugmaker surged during intraday trading following a report by the Korea Economic Daily, which cited investment banking sources. The report said Biogen approached Samsung to buy its shares in a deal that could be valued at more than $42 billion.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Weeks after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the ability of members of Congress and their spouses to make stock trades, the California Democrat disclosed several major purchases. Here they are \n   * 130 $CRM $210 calls 01/20/2023\n   * 50 $DIS $130 calls 09/16/2022\n   * 10 $GOOG $2000 calls 09/16/2022\n   * 100 $MU $50 calls 09/16/2022\n   * 100 $RBLX $100 calls 01/20/2023\n* This is actually insane… Twitter (TWTR) is now a favorite stock among institutional investors, who now hold a 79% stake in the company. [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twtr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twtr/institutional-holdings)\n* JetBlue (JBLU) said it will cut around 1,280 flights while Delta (DAL) announced it was canceling another 250 flights, following thousands of cancellations during Christmas weekend.\n* Foreign automakers have indicated an interest to the government of India's Tamil Nadu state in acquiring Ford Motor (F) plant there, after Ford announced it was winding down operations in that factory\n* Tesla (TSLA) needs to recall over 475,000 Model 3 and Model S cars after the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said rearview cameras mounted on these units are in risk of malfunctioning. \n* Amid the intense regulatory crackdown, the top 10 richest tech executives in China have lost a combined $80 billion. Pinduoduo Inc. founder Colin Huang lost the most this year -- $42.9 billion, or two-thirds of his fortune -- as shares of the e-commerce platform plunged from a high of $212 to just $54\n* Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant Group will cease operation of its online crowdfunded medical aid program Xianghubao on Jan. 28 citing “significant changes’ amid the government’s regulatory crackdown. It really has not been a good year for Chinese stocks\n\n“If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.\" -*Steve Jobs*",
