  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 8, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed today, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closing modestly in the red, breaking an insane rally pulled down by a decline in Tesla (TSLA) while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) continued their march higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, finished the day 0.33% higher.\n\nLast week, the Labor Department released the monthly October jobs report, which showed the pace of employment greatly improved after two disappointing months, with the report citing declining coronavirus cases and increased demand for workers for the uptick. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls, October:** \\+531,000 vs. +450,000 expected, and a great improvement over the +194,000 job added in September\n* **Unemployment rate:** 4.6% vs. 4.7% expected, 4.8% in September\n\nDuring a press conference, President Joe Biden said of the Labor report, “Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. In this historically strong recovery, unemployment has fallen again today,” President Joe Biden said during a press conference on Friday.”\n\nThough payrolls have grown every month so far in 2021, the economy remains more than 4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels following plunges in employment between March and April of 2020. And the civilian labor force was still down by nearly 3 million individuals compared to February 2020 as of October 2021.\n\nOn the inflation front, market participants are closely monitoring the Bureau of Labor’s October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to show yet another acceleration in consumer prices on both a monthly and annual basis, as ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances continue to cap production of goods at a time of soaring demand. Estimates as of Monday showed that consensus economists expect to see the CPI rise by 5.9% in October compared to last year, accelerating from September's 5.4% annual rate to reach the fastest rise since 1990.\n\nRubella Farooqi, Chief Economist at High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to clients, “We continue to expect that a normalization of demand and supply constraint or time will take pressure off inflation statistics. The exact timing is uncertain, given we cannot predict when supply chains will adjust. However, our best guess is that prices will start moderating by the middle of next year - possibly sooner if goods that are stuff in ports reach their destinations in the early part of the year, which will result in an excess supply of goods after holidays.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Ford Motors (F) crossed the $20 per share threshold for the first time since mid-2001, with investors seemingly encouraged by the company’s pivot into electric vehicles and the upcoming blockbuster Rivian IPO, of which Ford owns 12%\n* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell today but held onto the critical $1150 support after CEO Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers via a poll if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, a position worth roughly $20 billion\n* Though it was unable to hold the gains by close, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) became the third company to breach the $2 trillion market cap threshold, joining Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n* Italy's antitrust regulator has started proceedings to fine Google for allegedly restrictive clauses in the terms of service consumers have to accept to use Google Drive.\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged more than 10% after Meta Platforms (FB, soon to be MVRS) selected their chips to power its data center. AMD explained that the two companies worked together to develop a high performance processor based on the company’s 3rd Generation EPYC Processor.\n* Moreover, AMD announced new chips called  [**AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators**](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1032/new-amd-instinct-mi200-series-accelerators-bring), which are optimized for high-performance computing and artificial-intelligence workloads. The company described them as \"the first exascale-class GPU accelerators.\" AMD competes with **Nvidia** (**NVDA**) in GPUs. Sorry it sounds like jargon but as a massive semiconductor bull I could not be more excited for the future. I’ve said it many times before but personally NVDA is my #1, AMD is my #2\n* SoftBank’s Vision Fund, the largest tech-focused investment firm in the world with over $100 billion in capital, lost $10 billion this quarter amid the regulatory crackdown in China. The fund announced it was launching a $9 billion share buyback amid pressure from investors. The group’s largest asset, Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba , saw its valuation fall by around a third in the second quarter. Its stake in Chinese ride-hailer Didi, acquired for $12 billion, was valued at $7.5 billion. Another notable hit was Coupang (CPNG), a South Korean eCommerce company which gave up a third of its value.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) target raised by Wells Fargo from $145 to $180 at Overeweight. Stock currently around $150\n* Booking (BKNG) target raised by Susquehanna from $2850 to $3100 at Positive.
