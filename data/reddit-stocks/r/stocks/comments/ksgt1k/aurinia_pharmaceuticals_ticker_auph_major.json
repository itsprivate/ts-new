I will post link to the main article explaining in detail about it, but in short:</p>\n\n<p>-Aurinia Pharmaceuticals has one of the most important milestones in its history in a few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>-Next January 22, 2021 is the PDUFA where the FDA will decide the approval of the candidate drug Voclosporin.</p>\n\n<p>-Voclosporin approval by the FDA is almost assured (estimated at 95% chance of approval) thanks to the very good phase III trial data presented last December 2019.</p>\n\n<p>-Estimates of the potential revenues that Voclosporin could generate worldwide once approved range from $1.5B to $3B per year.</p>\n\n<p>They also have around $400+ mill in cash on hand with great leadership. </p>\n\n<p>The only other completion they have in this field is Glaxosmithkline that currently produces an inferior product (just approved dec 17) and is currently trading at $38/share</p>\n\n<p>Right now AUPH is only $13 a share, and with the high probability of being approved in a couple weeks, I have a feeling this thing will 🚀 straight to the moon, and evidence of that is how it jumped to $21 last December when it released its phase 3 trial results. Currently all analysts have a buy rating at a PT average of $23.</p>\n\n<p>Do your own DD, but I’m in with $5k waiting for this home run</p>\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395615-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-offers-good-entry-opportunity-next-pdufa-for-voclosporin\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395615-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-offers-good-entry-opportunity-next-pdufa-for-voclosporin</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
