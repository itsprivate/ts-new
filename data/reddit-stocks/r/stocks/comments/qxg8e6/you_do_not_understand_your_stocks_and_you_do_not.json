Most of you are valueing business on the market price that is quoted last second. \n\nThe other thing is that you do not understand the businesses you own!\n\nNo, saying Iunderstand Coca-Cola because i know it sells Coke is not understanding business. How many of you know the balance sheet of KO, how many of you read the 10Q and 10K, do you know that KO’s payout ratio of their dividends is above 80% and often was 100% plus? Do you know the management? Can you give a pricetag on these cash flows, that KO will make? \n\nAnd this is talking about KO, which is relatively easy to understand company, that nearly everyone has some experience with. I really do not believe that even 0,1% of people who read palantirs reports, looked at its valuation, and most importantly understand the business of the company.\n\nAnswer honestly to yourself.\n\nDo you really know the business you own?\n\nLastly i would want to say a story about mass opinions on companies. Microsoft and Apple were for many years considered mature companies with limited growth. Apple was even considered with negative growth rate. After last three years rally in their prices, the opinion on them changed so much that literally everyone believes that they must have them in their portfolio. \n\nWould you also consider this if the price of the stock did not change?",
