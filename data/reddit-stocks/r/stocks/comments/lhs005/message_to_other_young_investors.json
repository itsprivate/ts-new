I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn&#39;t want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn&#39;t go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my &quot;fun&quot; stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. </p>\n\n<p>By this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). </p>\n\n<p>Then came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. All in all, I&#39;ve lost 90% of my money in the past month. I&#39;m young so I can recover, and this wasn&#39;t money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don&#39;t have anyone to talk to. I can&#39;t sleep at nights, and can&#39;t really focus on anything else. I&#39;ve lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don&#39;t know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don&#39;t invest more than you&#39;re willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There&#39;s no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
