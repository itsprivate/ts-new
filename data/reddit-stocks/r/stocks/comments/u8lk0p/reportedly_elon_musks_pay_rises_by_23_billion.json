Combined with the previous three quarters' results, that surpasses milestones that trigger the vesting of the ninth through 11th of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk in his 2018 pay package.\n\nMusk Receives no salary at Tesla. His pay package requires Tesla's market capitalization and financial growth to hit a series of escalating targets.\n\nEach tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.4 million Tesla shares at $70.01 each, a discount of about 90 percent from Wednesday's $977.20 closing price. At the stock's current price, the three options tranches that will vest as a result of Tesla's March-quarter performance could generate a profit of about $23 billion, or almost $7.7 billion per tranche.\n\nLate last year, Musk netted $16.4 billion from selling about 10 percent of his stake in Tesla to meet to meet tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options.\n\n[https://www.autonews.com/executives/teslas-strong-q1-report-helps-add-23-billion-elon-musks-compensation](https://www.autonews.com/executives/teslas-strong-q1-report-helps-add-23-billion-elon-musks-compensation)  \n\n\nThis may be the highest paid CEO ever.
