The market has been acting absolutely wild as everyone can clearly see. People are pumping stocks for fun and that is worrying me a lot. If things go south, how big of a reaction will there be in the entire stock market?</p>\n\n<p>Gamestop, Blackberry, AMC, Nokia have been pumped really heavily and seeing 100% gains in a single day for no reason should warn us to be alert at all times. Especially now, when many of us haven’t experienced this ever before in this big of a scale. </p>\n\n<p>While I’m really liking how the retail investors are kicking the hedge fund managers’ asses, we all should be prepared for the worst. Once people start to realize their gains and start to sell, we’re in for a wild show. And that moment will come sooner or later. That’s just a fact. People will want money at some point. When that point comes, you should have probably sold and gotten out already.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t like to be bearish, but I’d say that there’s a some kind of a bubble now and it will affect all areas more or less.</p>\n\n<p>Fundamentals are literally trash for people. Microsoft and Apple released some staggering all time high results yesterday and only few people seemed to give a damn about it, at least in this sub. I wonder when we’re gonna go to a different direction and pivot towards a more fundamental orientated market. It could take a long time, or it could happen next month.</p>\n\n<p>Because in the end, the companies with solid fundamentals and consistant long term growth will be the ones that will perform in the long term... </p>\n\n<p>...But this is a different topic which needs to be discussed on a later date.</p>\n\n<p>The saddest part of this is that the ones who suffer from this, will be us, retail investors. People will think that Gamestop, AMC &amp; Co will only go up. That is unfortunately, not the case. </p>\n\n<p>And I’m fearing that some of us will realize that too late. Some people have bought stocks with debt and this will bite heavily in the ass, when these meme stocks go down hill. And trust me, they go down quicker than up.</p>\n\n<p>People’s mental health will be on the line, when they see their brokerage accounts heavily in the cold. This is my biggest worry. How will people react to this when things go south and GME drops from their current levels.</p>\n\n<p>So all I’m asking is for people to be wise with their money and put in an amount that they’re comfortable losing with. Stocks do go down. GME goes down. And everyone should be ready for it at all times.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
