So I'm swallowing the pride and posting about my losses. \n\nI started invested January 5 this year as a New Year's resolution. I got Rich Dad Poor dad youtube video recommended to me and didnt realize I had been spending my money on liabilities all this time. I went heavy into SPACs, Cathie Wood stocks, biotech, and I got into AMC due to the \"recovery\" stock trade that was all over CNBC. I somehow didnt have a red day with those stocks for 15 straight days and the turning point was WSB looking at short interest and pumping several stocks late January. And Robinhood shutting off the buy option. I had just started investing and didn't realize at the time that turning off buying pressure meant the stocks would tank. And that was my first blow up. My portfolio dropped 35% in a day. That day was January 28th.\n\nI started following WSB since while my account blew up it seemed their stocks were getting massive gains. So I went all in on weed stocks. And I recovered my losses. But I didnt take profits and I had another blow up on February 10th. My account had another 35% drop. As I was in options and the entire weed sector crashed in premarket. So by the time I could sell it was too late.\n\nWith what I now know I should have had trailing stop losses if I was in momentum stocks but I decided after the weed stock crash to go all in on tech stocks to name some of them CRWD, AAPL, MSFT, CRWD, NET, and SE. It worked for 2 months I had somehow recovered my losses for the third time. Then around the week of 4/20 there started to be inflation panic and those stocks tanked. Stock subs and CNBC were calling tech stocks terrible at the time and after three weeks of constant losses and my account blew up for the third time I sold all my stocks around May 10-13. Which in retrospect was a bottom.\n\n\n\nSo I got back into stocks the following week May 17th. And I stopped following WSB stock picks, did my own DD, and have a diversified portfolio and a Roth IRA with index funds. But Im sick to my stomach since im down still down 40% overall 5 months later. When I gave up on WSB stocks that meant I sold AMC in February which if I had I held that would have recovered all my losses from the May panic sell at the bottom. Now once a month there is FUD that the market is overvalued and there is gonna be a crash on stock subs and CNBC. And im like wtf I already dealt with three crashes that just gets swept under the rug with SPACs, weed stocks, and several small cap stocks losing like 70% of their value since Febuary. It just feels like it is a different market from my first two months and I messed up not taking profits on three occasions. My portfolio would have been up 500% instead im down 40%.",
