Asked about his level of commitment, Powell replied: \"It's unconditional...we have a labor market that's sort of unsustainably hot and we are very far from our inflation target.\" On Wednesday, Krishna Guha, a former Fed staffer now vice-chairman of Evercore ISI, noted that Powell did not use the word \"unconditional\" in his testimony to the Senate, even though the word was in the Fed's written report to Congress included as part of Powell's testimony. Guha said the fact Powell left this word out was a key factor in his view that the Fed chairman was \"less hawkish than expected.\" Guha said that \"unconditional\" implies a readiness by the Fed to accept higher unemployment, and a recession, in order to get inflation down.",
