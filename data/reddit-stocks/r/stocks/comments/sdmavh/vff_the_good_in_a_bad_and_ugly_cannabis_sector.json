Here's my thesis on why the market is severely undervaluing the stock.\n\nFirst let's hit the books\n\n[Metrics](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VFF/key-statistics?p=VFF)\n\nA quick look at VFF's performance over the past few years shows exceptional growth in revenue and most significantly a profit turning business. Something that is a major rarity in the Canadian Cannabis sector. VFF looks to be trading at a forward P/E of 19. Meanwhile other Canadian cannabis companies struggle to break even. Furthermore, at an EV/rev of only 2.3 and a P/B of 1.4 - there is clearly room for substantial inflation of the stock price to bring the company up to industry standards.\n\nVFF also is expanding it's scope. They have access to a future US legalized market through a huge Texas greenhouse - the CEO estimates that this greenhouse would boost revenue by $300 million dollars on conversion. They acquired, the profitable, Botanical Health giving active access to the US CBD market but more importantly huge scope for the THC market upon legalization. They also have the right to purchase 80% of Dutch company Leli Holland opening up the entirety of a new European market.\n\nBased on future revenue and earnings opportunity, and the fact VFF are unlikely to dilute shares for anything but valuable acquisitions, I have price targets of $15 with no US legalization news within 2 years, and $30 with US legalization news. This is conservative based on no \"hype\" valuations and VFF should, based on fundamentals, outperform all other Canandian cannabis firms. With a \"hype\" run and if VFF if fairly valued relative to the other companies I see no reason why VFF should not trade at 2 times the top estimate - in line with previous Cannabis bull runs.\n\nI haven't even touched on another unmentionable company buying up shares on the open market, or the great possibility for VFF to increase their margins when moving towards more premium focuses.\n\nVFF is simply being valued as a tomato grower not a Cannabis company.\n\nSources:\n\n[VFF Earnings Call](https://villagefarms.com/investor-calls)\n\nDisclosure:\n\nI hold £20,000 of CfD contracts in VFF",
