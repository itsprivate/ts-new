Briefly here is what I discovered:\n\n-People are out!  The malls were busy and people seemed happy to be out in the mall again.  \n\n-About 15% went maskless, but still 85% still chose to wear masks even though not required\n\n-While the malls were busy, I wouldn't consider sales to be at a high level.  Most people were eating, walking, enjoying the time out.  But as I observed from different angles (throughout the mall, cashier lines, exits of mall) most shoppers did not have or leave with shopping bags.  \n\n-When asked (I spoke with 14 different shoppers) nearly 80% said they felt cautiously optimistic for the economy going forward.\n\n-There were two positive exceptions, one major and one minor.\n\nMinor exception: Nordstrom.  They had some lines, more customers than other stores and active buying throughout.  \n\nMajor exception: Luxury goods.  Gucci, Coach, and the rest all seemed busy but above all else, the king of all was Louis Vuitton, consistently had a packed store with lines down the mall waiting to get in.  \n\n-Nike shut it's stores for Juneteenth which unfortunately for them was a prime Saturday shopping day.\n\n-One surprising active location was Dave and Busters.  I was drawn in by the noise and surprised to see so many young people in there.  It's become the modern arcade and it was packed with game players.\n\n-Nearly every single retail outlet had a \"Now Hiring\" sign.  Truly an amazing sight to see how demand workers are right now.  \n\nAnd finally, major competitors Annie Anne's and Wetzel's Pretzels are both doing well but poor Annie is not winning this fight as of now.",
