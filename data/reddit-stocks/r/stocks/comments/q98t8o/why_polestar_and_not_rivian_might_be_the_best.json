They have delivered well over 20,000 vehicles so far, and they are projected to have a revenue of $1.6B this year.\n\nHere you can see some sales data from Europe, not included are the sales in China and North America:\n\n[https://www.polestar-forum.com/threads/polestar-european-sales.573/page-10](https://www.polestar-forum.com/threads/polestar-european-sales.573/page-10)\n\nThe table shows the numbers in million SEK, **Polestar did $636 million USD in revenue in 2020 which is slated to grow by 151% in 2021 to $1.6B:** [**https://imgur.com/PpSpkrX**](https://imgur.com/PpSpkrX)\n\nThat’s BEFORE the release of the Polestar 3, their new SUV which will be made in the USA in Ridgeville, NC, as well as their 4th model which is the Polestar Precept. It is a full-size electric sedan comparable to an S-Class or the Lucid Air in size.\n\n**Sales Channel:**\n\nPolestar has more traffic than Rivian and Lucid Motors combined: [https://imgur.com/NUYjdQS](https://imgur.com/NUYjdQS) The Source of this data is Similarweb.com. Given the fact that all 3 use their website as the main sales channel this is a pretty significant finding. Polestar also has more Google searches than Rivian or Lucid Motors: [Google Data](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=de&tz=-120&date=today+3-m&hl=de&q=%2Fg%2F11c20cdcdf,Polestar,Rivian&tz=-120&sni=3)\n\n**Why is GGP\\*I trading at $10.02 if it is as great as you claim?**\n\nGGP\\*I is a SP\\*C, which means when it went public it was just a trust-account full of money. These kinds of IPOs are bought by arbitrage funds, that receive a share of a warrant for each unit they buy. Before GGP\\*I announced to merge with Polestar nearly 100% of its float was owned by these arb funds. They sell the shares at $10.xx because their aim is to make a few % return and hop into the next IPO. So in the last couple days these funds unloaded about 65M shares on buyers who want to hold because of Polestar. You can easily imagine how such a big supply willing to be sold at $10.xx will keep the price down. I am estimating we are about 15M shares or 5-6 trading days away from these funds having sold out. And since most buyers until then have a cost basis at $10.xx they won't sell for a few percent in profit.\n\n**Upside:**\n\nI am pretty sure you guys know that LCID is trading at $44B and Rivian is looking to IPO at $80B this year. Together they have delivered 0 vehicles to their customers, Polestar is going public at $20B at $10 per share. You can do your own math but I am pretty confident a 50% upside or $30B marketcap are realistic for this company.\n\nI was an investor in LCID and now I am in Polestar. Both companies offer exceptionally great returns IMO but at $10.02 and 20B market-cap Polestar seems to be a lot cheaper at the moment. I am not saying Polestar is better than Lucid, just that it might be a better investment at the current price.",
