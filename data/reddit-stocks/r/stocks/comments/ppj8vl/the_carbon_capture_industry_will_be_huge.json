  "selftext": "**The Case for Carbon Capture**\n\nThe world produces about 40 Gigatonnes of CO2 per year (that’s 1 billion tonnes). In order to reach the global warming goal of 1.5°C proposed by the Paris Climate Agreement, the world needs to be essentially carbon net zero or negative by 2050. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says a 20 Gigatonne/year reduction in CO2 emissions will need to come from switching to electric cars and transitioning energy sources from fossil fuel, coal, and natural gas to solar, nuclear, geothermal wind, or hydroelectric. As for the other half, there are a lot of things where we just don’t have a green alternative for: airplanes, industrial furnaces, freight trains, tanker ships, etc. To deal with this other 20 Gigatonnes of CO2, the world is going to have to adopt carbon capture technology on a huge scale. The IPCC says that carbon removal technology will have to be on the order of 100-1000 Gigatonnes of CO2 per year over the 21st century. It’s clear there is currently a huge opportunity for carbon capture companies.\n\nSo much so that some oil and gas companies are turning their attention to it. Occidental Petroleum’s CEO has said that they are becoming a “carbon management company”. Big names like Microsoft have committed to going carbon neutral by 2030. Only one way to do that. Here’s another quote:\n“According to most climate models, decisive carbon removal together with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are needed to limit global warming to below 2°C from pre-industrial levels. To reach that target, it is forecast that the carbon removal industry will grow to the size of today’s oil & gas industry by 2050.” (Source) [https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/sonar/sonar2020/sonar2020-carbon-removal-insurance.html]\n\nI should mention here that there are 2 types of carbon capture, one where they strip a concentrated source of CO2 like the off-gasses from combustion. The other is called Direct Air Capture where they strip regular atmospheric air of CO2. Both have a big role to play.\n\nYou might be thinking, can’t we just plant more trees? Reforestation will help but it will take 3x the area of the USA to remove 10 Gigatonnes/year of CO2. There just isn’t enough land for that.\nCarbon Capture can do what trees can do in far less space. It is going to be a huge industry and has to be a huge industry in the fight against climate change.\n(IPCC Source) [https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/]\n\nMany governments are introducing carbon taxes. Canada already has one and plans on ramping it up to $170 CAD/tonne by 2030.\n\n**Stocks**\nThis is such a new industry that there aren't many public companies. Here are a couple:\n\nCNSX: DELT is a Canadian company that strips CO2 from concentrated sources like flue gasses. I like them because the Canadian carbon tax will help them a ton. \n\nOXY is using Carbon Engineering' tech to build a massive carbon capture plant in the next couple years. They plan on pulling 1 million tonnes of CO2 per year from this facility and have plans for many future carbon capture plants. They also have a lot of the infrastructure in place needed to sequester CO2.\n\nDisclosure: I have a small position in DELT and no position in OXY. I'm waiting to see how this first carbon capture facility goes for them.",
