Many brokerages already offer investors fractional trading, allowing small investors to buy a slice of seemingly expensive stocks.\n\nIn its 2022 proxy filing, the electric vehicle and renewable energy business, also revealed that board member Larry Ellison currently owns 1.5% of Tesla shares. Ellison plans to relinquish his duties as a member of Tesla’s board of directors, but the filing did not say who may replace him.\n\nThe filing also says that Tesla CEO Elon Musk currently holds 23.5% of Tesla shares and Vanguard holds 6% of Tesla shares. Musk sold a considerable chunk of his Tesla holdings since late 2021, in part to shore up a stake in Twitter, the social networking giant he agreed to acquire for around $44 billion.\n\nTesla announced a similar [five-for-one stock split in August 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/tesla-announces-five-for-one-stock-split.html).\n\nIn thirteen different proposals suggested by shareholders, Tesla is being asked to examine and disclose more about its: anti-harassment and discrimination efforts, lobbying practices, supply chains and labor, and details about its own water use and water-related climate impacts and risks.\n\nThe company plans to hold its annual shareholder meeting online and with a limited number of shareholders invited to attend in person at the new Tesla factory in Austin, Texas on August 4, 2022.\n\n[(link to article)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/tesla-files-for-3-for-1-stock-split.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
