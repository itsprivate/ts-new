[This article](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/5-electric-bus-makers-shifting-next-gear) does well to show the competition, which is all EU/CN-based. Over and over, the Sec of Energy and President himself have stressed they want US-based companies to reap the fiscal initiatives. They are a E-bus company, not passenger vehicles. They're not wasting capital trying to edge out TSLA, F, GM, VW, etc. They know their niche, they are the main player in it, and it's about to get big fiscal tailwinds for this.\n   * Municipalities aren't just buying this to show how \"green\" they are. EV busses promise to dramatically reduce preventative and corrective maintenance over the lifetime. If the Feds are fiscally rewarding you for making this switch, why wouldn't they go this route over renewing ICE busses 100% on their own dime?\n* The odd pump-and-dump you see from a few months ago was when it was a S\\*AC at the height of those pump-and-dumps, and it entered into an agreement with Proterra (it's no longer a S\\*AC). The wheat is separating from the chaff among those companies now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the short-term opportunist crowd:\n\n* Bullish options chain up to $30 and some recent unusual options activity ATM.\n* Short Interest is hard to tell from [Ortex](https://www.ortex.com/symbol/Nasdaq/PTRA/short_interest) this early in the new ticker's life, but:\n   * 99.80% utilization\n   * [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/PTRA) shows a measly 1,000 shares available to borrow at. . .\n   * 86.8% cost to borrow.
