This actually got my interested in the stock market and I&#39;ve done my best to understand the reasons behind why that happened and just try grasp some basic fundamentals.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing AMC being hyped up by the same group of people that hyped GME I placed an order for a bunch at 10 dollars when the pre market was still at 6-8 and then it skyrocketed to a pre market of 20 dollars. I got scared and thoughts I&#39;d miss the bus if I didn&#39;t buy right then and there and so I bought at about 18 and the value instantly tanked. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously AMC is a side show to the main event GME but based off what I&#39;ve been able to find the market seems to be incredibly shorted. I see this site being thrown around a lot <a href=\"https://www.highshortinterest.com\">https://www.highshortinterest.com</a> and again I&#39;m really not sure how credible it is. There are lots of claims that this is the week AMC is gonna sky rocket and as much as I want to believe them I want to know just how credible/likely it is that we could see AMC hit 30/40 or even 50 this week.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the value tanks I suppose I&#39;ve learnt my lesson about buying in to hyped stocks and to do actual legitimate research before hand. AMC&#39;s peaks pre covid were hitting upwards of 30 as well so really this isn&#39;t a complete loss.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
