There is a 50$ fee to buy the stock on some platforms, others (like Robinhood) might hide that fee.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot put certain calls on this probably due to liquidity (not sure, you tell me).</p>\n\n<p>Note* Trading volumes are high enough that you won’t get trapped should it continue to drop. (But you already knew that).</p>\n\n<p>Note* RR has gone through bankruptcy before, even that hasn’t stopped it. Should it go to that extreme again, it might rebound all the same.</p>\n\n<p>PROs:\nOver the next year it should see a LARGE boost in stock price along with the return to travel culture, if not large, than significant, but I have no crystal ball, however my sentiment is shared by many regarding the aviation future.</p>\n\n<p>The have announced exploration avenues and R&amp;D projects that are in the pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>They have a great brand and can leverage other sectors besides aviation to keep them going.</p>\n\n<p>OVERALL:\nRR comes with risk, but seems like it could be one of the huge rewards out there for the taking in later 2022. it seems positioned to easily 4x. If there is a time to buy it is today or the last few weeks. Let me know what you think, how is your risk assessment? Why would or wouldn’t you pick up RR.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
