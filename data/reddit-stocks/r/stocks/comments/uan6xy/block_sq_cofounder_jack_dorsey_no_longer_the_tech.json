Block updated its bylaws to reflect Dorsey’s new role, removing the requirement for the company to have an officer holding the titles of CEO and president.\n\nIt’s yet another way that Dorsey is intersecting with Tesla’s [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/), who is [trying](https://carbon.cnbc.com/107049558) to buy [Twitter](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TWTR), the other company that Dorsey co-founded and used to run. Last year, Musk [took on](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/elon-musk-officially-made-the-technoking-of-tesla.html) the title of “Technoking of Tesla,” although he still continues as CEO. Musk later said his position as CEO was “a made-up title.”\n\nDorsey has made similar comments at least as far back as 2012, when he tweeted, “Titles, like ‘CEO’, get in the way of doing the right thing. Respect to the people who ignore titles, and fight like hell for what is right.”",
