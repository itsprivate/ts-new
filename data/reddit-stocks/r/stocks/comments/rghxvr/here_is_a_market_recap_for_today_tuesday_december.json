This would conclude the tapering process in March and open up greater optionality for an earlier liftoff.”\n\nMoody’s, one of the main American credit rating agencies, said \"The Federal Reserve is leading the charge with more aggressive asset tapering on the back of inflation being less transitory than initially thought. The first hike in the federal funds rate is expected by September 2022.” \n\nPIMCO managing director and portfolio manager Sonali Pier said that the firm expects to see two hikes in 2022, three hikes in 2023, and potentially four in 2024, with the Fed trying to bring the policy rate to neutral.\n\nA lot of new economic data due this week.
