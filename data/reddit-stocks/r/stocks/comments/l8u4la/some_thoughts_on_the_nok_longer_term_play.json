Pretty new to option trading so don’t want to go totally in yet, but depending on what happens with earnings I might pick up some more.</p>\n\n<p>I think a lot of the commentary around NOK seems to be expecting it to moon this week or next week, and while a good earnings release might see that, I want to explain at a high level why I’m bullish longer term, and not looking at it as a get rich quick, or a short squeeze or anything like that. As I say, pretty new, so would welcome people poking holes.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly – NOK is not a mobile company, it is 5G company. 5G has enormous potential in the world – it will be a critical part of truly autonomous vehicles, drone technology etc. It’s not just so you can stream your favorite OnlyFans in 4k while on a car trip with your parents. It’s also worth noting that 5G hasn’t even scratched the surface yet. Mobile companies saying they have “5G networks” are full of it, they are retrofitted 4G networks that can barely be called 5G light. 5G requires all new infrastructure, and the expected expenditure across the world is measured in the trillions, not billions.</p>\n\n<p>There are 3 main players in the 5G market – Ericcson, Nokia, and Huawei. Other players (like Samsung) are in the mix, but at a lower level (although do represent a competitive threat to Nokia). Huawei has largely been shut out of 5G in the western world, which means Nokia &amp; Ericsson are in a prime position to capitalize. Ericsson actually has much higher exposure to China than Nokia, which doesn’t seem ot be priced into their share price, but one would expect China will take revenge eventually</p>\n\n<p>Between Ericcson &amp; Nokia – a lot of key metrics (revenue, margins etc.) are pretty comparable. Both have revenue around ~US$25b, broadly similar margins etc. Despite that, Nokia’s market cap is around ~$25b, vs Ericsson is DOUBLE that at around ~$42b. In other words – Ericsson is trading at a significant premium to Nokia at the moment, despite having reasonably similar underlying businesses. The general belief is that Ericsson has been the better run business, has a bigger share of the 5G market etc., but that also doesn’t give Nokia credit for the work they have done recently, including putting a complete change to their operating model going into place 1/1/21, a new management team etc. While there’s a risk none of that pans out, it also represents a good opportunity if they can start to run the business a bit better.</p>\n\n<p>Ericsson released earnings this last week and crushed it – earnings rose 70% compared to last year, with 2020 operating income up 163% compared to 2019. They are still massively exposed in China, which still doesn’t seem priced in (share price rose ~10% after earnings release). Nokia releases earnings this week – if they meet or beat (consensus is a miss I believe), and particularly if they reinstate a dividend, Nokia could be seen a lot more favorably in the market. Alternatively, if it’s a miss I still think it’ll be a good buying opportunity for an expected earnings crush a quarter or two from now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
