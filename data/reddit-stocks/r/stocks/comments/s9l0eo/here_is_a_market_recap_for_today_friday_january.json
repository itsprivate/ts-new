Shares of Netflix (NFLX) fell roughly 23% lower after the company posted a disappointing subscriber growth numbers, with the company projecting 2.5 million new users for the first quarter of 2022 versus the 6.3 million anticipated, according to Bloomberg data. Shares of Disney (DIS) and Roku (ROKU) fell in sympathy.\n\nMeanwhile, Peloton (PTON) stock has fallen below its IPO price after the company after the company announced it was cutting production of its product, citing waning demand. \n\nMark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said “It is hese infamous stay-at-home plays ... that had been bid up to valuations that get to the point where they're priced for perfection. Anything that is released about the companies' investment results or prospects that doesn't meet or exceed very elevated expectations leads to gigantic disappointment in the form of a share price decline.”\n\nRecent market volatility can be attributed to the multidecade jump in consumer and producer prices reported last week, which served as a reminder that inflation remains the key driver of risk and uncertainty in the year ahead. \n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 7% in December compared to a year ago, the fastest pace of increase since 1982 and the eighth straight month in which inflation exceeded 5%. Excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, core CPI rose 5.5%, the most since 1991.\n\nLike last year, inflation in the prices of goods played a large part in the jump. For example, prices of used cars and trucks soared 37%, and furniture prices rose 14% from a year ago. While pandemic-related supply-and-demand imbalances continue to drive prices for durable goods higher, services inflation is also strengthening but to a lesser extent, rising 3.7% in December. \n\nOn the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.\n\nThe extent to the rise in prices caused the Fed to pivot to a more hawkish stance, with policy suggesting the Central Bank stance is shifting from supporting the economy and the labor market to combating ongoing inflation. With higher prices persisting at a higher level than originally expected, members of the Fed are now calling for three to four interest rate hikes next year, with the earliest projected for March 2022. \n\nJeffrey Kleintop, Chief Global Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, said “I think there is a rotation going on towards those areas of the market that have been neglected for a long time — not just months, but years. Areas like financials and energy. Even health care, which is an area that had done a bit better during the pandemic really isn't seeing any kind of multiples as it did in the past. I think those areas of the market have more durability here as we look at an environment where earnings growth is slowing so valuations matter more,\" he added. \"And many of these companies can look to generate earnings growth in this environment of rising interest rates and commodity prices, whereas tech is a bit more challenged as goods demand begins to slow.\"\n\nA gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased solidly in December, suggesting the expansion would continue despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and anticipated interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve to tame high inflation. \n\nThe Conference Board's closely watched[ Leading Economic Index (LEI) ](https://www.conference-board.org/data/bcicountry.cfm?cid=1)rose 0.8% in December, matching consensus estimates, according to Bloomberg data. This picked up from November's 0.7% clip, which was downwardly revised from the 1.1% gain previously reported. \n\nAtaman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at the Conference Board, said “The U.S. LEI ended 2021 on a rising trajectory, suggesting the economy will continue to expand well into the spring. For the first quarter, headwinds from the Omicron variant, labor shortages, and inflationary pressures—as well as the Federal Reserve’s expected interest rate hikes—may moderate economic growth. The Conference Board forecasts GDP growth for Q1 2022 to slow to a relatively healthy 2.2 percent (annualized). Still, for all of 2022, we forecast the US economy will expand by a robust 3.5 percent—well above the pre-pandemic trend growth.”\n\n“A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.” - Seneca",
