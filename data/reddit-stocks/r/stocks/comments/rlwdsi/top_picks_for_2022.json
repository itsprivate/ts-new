Any ticker symbols in particular that you have loaded up from these recent dips?\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\nI am hoping that NVDA continues its growth next year as its online services and the metaverse gain traction. AMD too obviously from their recent partnership with Tesla and Meta. Both of these companies had an amazing year that I believe will continue their growth for the next few years at least.\n\nSoFi and IONQ are also two stocks that I believe will be good bets for 2022, especially as the BC gets approved for SoFi. IONQ has strong fundaments and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\nIm also DCAing into Paypal, as I believe that it just got hammered this year. In 2022, venmo, owned by paypal, is coming to amazon which is exciting news!\n\nWhat are your thoughts and top picks for 2022?",
