The hedge fund purchased shares of AMC and GameStop, according to a recent SEC filing.\n\nInteresting and somewhat of an ironic bet there to see a hedge fund betting on meme stocks. And this marks its first ever stake in AMC. The last time that Bridgewater owned shares of GameStop was in early 2018. Had it held its position during the short squeeze last year, it would have been valued at about $1.5 billion. At the time it owned shares, it was about $40 million.\n\nAlso taking another interesting stake, Bridgewater switched up Elon Musk for Warren Buffett.
