Markets have bottomed already by this time as markets move way faster than the risk. While most people assess and understand risk in real-time based on watching the news or reading articles, the stock market had already anticipated the risks before they become widely known. When most investors realize that it’s going to be a recession or an economic crisis, it’s too late.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest gains are made at the depth of the crisis and biggest losses happens when everything seems to be rosy. The market is a future discounting mechanism and all the bad news was quickly priced-in already. It’s the economic recovery that the market will be pricing in after peak fear on the unknown has been discounted.</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>It’s a good thing for the markets when the majority’s expectations on the economy are so low</strong> –When covid was hitting countries left and right and the first lockdowns started, almost everyone was expecting gloom and doom for the global economy and almost no one expected a V-shaped recovery. I remember most we’re calling for a U back then. But when people slowly realized that it’s not going to be the end of the world and corporate earnings after covid lockdowns were implemented started to come out? The stock market just never looked back again.</p>\n\n<p>This just shows that equity markets care far less about economic outcomes in vacuums and far more about whether the outcomes exceeded expectations. We could see all the worse earnings numbers and gdp reports that we will ever see in our lifetimes, but when the expectations are just massively low, even a slightly better than expected earnings report will cause the stock market to rally. And this thing kind of happened last year when people thought that it’s going to be apocalypse.</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Event-Driven Bear markets are vicious but lack stamina</strong> – This is the type of bear market that we’ve experienced last year. It was a huge and fast collapse in march 2020 compared to other bear markets in the past. This one is an easier environment to trade on for active traders because of large swings and extreme volatility and recovery is much more faster too.</p>\n\n<p>Other types of bear markets that we can experience are those that are:</p>\n\n<p>Structural in nature (imbalances and financial bubbles, price shocks, deflation) – harder to trade because it’s more of a slow death and slow recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Cyclical - regular business cycle typically happens during periods of high inflation and rising interest rates, slow death too</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Initial Jobless Claims as a key indicator for recessions and bear markets</strong> – Stock market bottoms almost exactly the time when initial jobless claims reach a peak. It was really confusing back in march 2020 when there was one trading session where futures are down big and suddenly reversed into green and went on a rally when the first post-covid lockdown, initial jobless claims report was given out. People had a hard time coping up with reality during that time on how the stock market can go up when the unemployment number was really terrible and millions lost their jobs. Then I read the insights of analysts on why that kind of thing happened and I realized that people thought that the unemployment numbers can’t get any worse than that anymore and jobless claims have reached a peak, the stock market was already looking ahead by years into the future and betting that the worst is over. Just like how the stock market plummeted well before anyone grasped the full damage to the job market. The market was correct too as the jobless numbers went on a steady decline after that and now we are even seeing labor shortages in USA.</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Last but not the least, “Don’t Fight the Fed”</strong> – probably the single most important lesson that we have witnessed, real-time throughout this crisis. Should’ve went all-in already in March 2020, without hesitations when the fed was able to throw the whole kitchen sink after they were allowed to backstop the whole corporate credit market and even junk bonds, credit spreads stopped imploding after this. Turmoil on the market was calmed down, equities went on a non-stop lockout rally while most people we’re waiting for another crash to happen again.</p>\n\n<p>I remember there was even one trading session back in June 2020 where the dow was trading down like 900-1000 points throughout the day and suddenly the fed just said something on press release like they are going to add more to their corporate bond purchases, the 1000 point drop was magically erased intraday. This crisis was basically one whole playground for the fed and we saw how powerful these central banks are in creating a boom cycle for the markets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
