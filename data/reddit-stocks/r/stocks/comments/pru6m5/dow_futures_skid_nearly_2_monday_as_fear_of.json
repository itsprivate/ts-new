Investors also were positioning ahead of this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\n\n**How are stock futures trading?**\n\n* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures [**YM00,** **-2.01%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/YM00?mod=MW_story_quote) dropped 671 points, or 1.9%, to 33,791.\n* S&P 500 futures [**ES00,** **-1.82%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ES00?mod=MW_story_quote) fell 78 points, or 1.8%, to 4,343.\n* Nasdaq-100 futures [**NQ00,** **-1.76%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/NQ00?mod=MW_story_quote) tumbled 1.7%, or 260 points, to 15,066.\n\n**What’s driving the market?**\n\nIs this the correction that some strategists have anticipated?\n\nA downturn in China’s property market, which suffered heavy losses Monday, with shares of China Evergrande [**3333,** **-10.24%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/3333?countryCode=HK&mod=MW_story_quote) falling 13% in Hong Kong, were threatening to drag stocks sharply lower.\n\nMarkets were closed in mainland China for a holiday, but the Hang Seng [**HSI,** **-3.30%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/HSI?countryCode=HK&mod=MW_story_quote) dropped over 3%.\n\nThe 8.25% Evergrande bond that has interest payments due this week was trading at around 29 cents to the dollar on Monday, according to Reuters. That is as Wall Street investors are poised to pick up where they left off last week — on a weaker footing.  \n\n“The dip is due to a variety of causes, including fading earnings estimates, uncertainty related to shifting monetary policy, and instability in the world’s second-largest economy as a result of escalating crackdowns,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note to clients.\n\nMarkets will be closely watching for any talk of tapering at the Fed’s two-day policy meeting that begins Sept. 21. The central bank’s ultra-easy policy stance, put in place more than a year ago to help the economy cope with the pandemic, looks untenable to some given spikes in inflation.\n\nThe economy has been giving off mixed signals, though, amid rising cases of coronavirus due to the delta variant. Friday’s losses for Wall Street came as a reading on consumer sentiment held close to a roughly 10-year low.\n\nAnalysts also were discussing the inability, so far, of Congress to increase the debt ceiling.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-drop-300-points-as-china-property-fears-grow-11632121264?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-drop-300-points-as-china-property-fears-grow-11632121264?mod=home-page)",
