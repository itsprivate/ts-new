  "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 9th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation will be the sizzling topic for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/inflation-will-be-the-sizzling-topic-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-.html)**\n*****\n> With fresh evidence the labor market is on the mend, investors’ focus shifts to inflation in the coming week and whether it will continue to heat up or show signs of abating.\n*****\n> There is a series of inflation data expected: the consumer price index and the producer price index, released Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n*****\n> Jobs and inflation are two key factors that influence the Federal Reserve in making its decisions on policy. Markets are hanging on anything that will help determine when the central bank will start to step away from the measures it took to support the economy during the pandemic, including its $120 billion per month purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n> Friday’s July jobs report showed a healthy 943,000 increase in payrolls. That gain is enough to spur Fed watchers into thinking the central bank could announce in the next couple of months that it will dial back its support measures. That’s important since ending the bond-buying program is a first step toward raising interest rates. It’s the Fed’s near-zero rate policy that has helped drive the liquidity feeding the stock market’s gains and keeping rates low.\n*****\n> “I think the keys for the next week are going to be both CPI and PPI. We get some inflation data for consumers and for businesses. Those will be closely watched. Jobless claims as well,” State Street Global Advisors chief investment strategist Michael Arone said.\n*****\n> “The Fed has made it clear that the labor market is key to what they do next,” he added. “Jobless claims will continue to be an item that gets looked at every week. Then finally we’re going to get consumer sentiment. Those are four things that could be market movers.”\n*****\n> The Fed has said elevated inflation, running over 5% at the consumer level recently, is just temporary. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect another hot reading for the consumer price index, with core inflation rising 0.4% or 4.3% year over year. The CPI is released Wednesday. Headline inflation was at 5.4% in June, and core, excluding food and energy, was at 4.5%.\n*****\n> “That 0.4% follows a 0.9% rise in June,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said. “Then you get PPI Thursday and import prices Friday. Import prices have been running hot and import prices are expected to be up 10.5% year-over-year. That follows over 11% the month before.”\n*****\n> Economists said if there is another strong employment report for August, then that would support the Fed moving to start tapering its bond-buying program. But one wild card for the economy is the course of the latest Covid outbreak and whether it will crimp economic activity and hiring.\n*****\n> In making a case that inflation is fleeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pointed to what seems to be a temporary sharp jump in used car prices, and also the decline in lumber prices after a sharp run-up. The Fed’s target for inflation is 2%, but policymakers said they will tolerate an average range around 2% before acting, as long as inflation does not stay too high for too long.\n*****\n> “Used car prices are beginning to show signs of moderation. I’ll argue that ‘you show me used car prices, and I’ll show you rent [rising],’” Boockvar said. ”‘You show me a drop in lumber prices. I’ll show you a 10-year high in aluminum prices.’ Look at natural gas. It’s at a six-year high. It’s broad based.”\n*****\n> A protracted period of inflation would harm the economy and negatively affect stocks. Corporations so far have been passing along rising costs to their customers in the form of higher prices, but if they can no longer do that at some point, profit margins will shrink.\n*****\n> # Fed speakers\n> There are a few Federal Reserve officials speaking in the week ahead. Market pros are looking to them to help clarify the central bank’s intentions on tapering. The expectation is that the Fed will announce in September or later in the fall that it will taper back its $120 billion a month bond program, starting at the end of the year or early next year.\n*****\n> The tapering is expected to be gradual and continue for 10 months or more. The Fed’s own forecasts show its first rate hikes happening in 2023.\n*****\n> More information could come from the Fed when officials gather for their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming at the end of the month. But action is not expected to be taken until the September meeting or later.\n*****\n> “We have two voters Monday who are speaking and that’s important. Both lean toward tapering,” Boockvar said.\n*****\n> “You could add a few more voices to this,” he said. “It could be a showdown between [Fed Governor] Lael Brainard and [Chicago Fed President] Charles Evans on one side and [Fed Governor Christopher] Waller and some of these Fed presidents on the other.”\n*****\n> The bond market has responded to the idea that the Fed could wind down its bond buying policy. The 10-year Treasury yield crept up to 1.29% Friday afternoon, after hitting a low of 1.13% during the week.\n*****\n> Yields, which move opposite price, had been moving lower on a number of factors, including concerns about Covid disrupting the economy.\n*****\n> NatWest’s John Briggs said the 10-year yield may now be moving to a new higher range, following the jobs report. “Maybe you’re now instead of a 1.10% to 1.30% range you’re in a 1.20% to 1.40%. Maybe you’re shifting the range a little higher,” he said.\n*****\n> Briggs said the bond market will be impacted if the inflation number is hotter than expected. “I think it will matter. I’ve always thought the inflation story is the real story anyway. We have rents picking up in the back half of the year. That’s going to keep inflation above 3%. That’s going to be a challenge to the Fed,” he said.\n*****\n> As for stocks, State Street’s Arone expects the market to continue to “grind higher.”\n*****\nThe Dow and S&P 500 closed at new records Friday. The Dow gained 0.8% for the week, finishing at 35,208, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.9% to 4,436. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week to 14,835.\n*****\n> Earnings continue to roll out in the coming week, but the volume of the releases drops off dramatically. Reports are expected from Walt Disney, eBay, Wendy’s and others.\n*****\n> “Earnings season, we’ll be putting behind us. It was stellar. Then we have sort of a vacuum between earnings and Jackson Hole,” Arone said.\n*****\n> “The market has seemed to take the variant news in stride, but investors are cautious,” he said. “The jobs number does help alleviate some of those growth scare concerns, concerns about the slowdown in growth. Numbers like this certainly help investors with their anxiety about that.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Bu4yplC.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9dPtCyw.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/bpBqKiM.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnXOGek.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XprOFrv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eI3Ta1u.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eE40BKp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hVsbntP.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C4YQ6e6.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PIlKQup.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/0wYYcgM.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5Zb324i.png)**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/NrzNjWu.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/UqUPIBU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # SPY Snoozefest Coming To An End?\n\n> In today's Morning Lineup, we noted how the major US equity indices have been a bit sleepy with each one having risen less than 1% over the five days ending yesterday. As shown below, that lack of volatility actually extends back to the prior week as well. The S&P 500 (SPY) has generally trended in a sideways range over the past two weeks. That was until today. While yesterday's move higher brought SPY to the high end of that recent range, the reaction to the strong NFP report is marking a more distinct breakout.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080621-SPY.png))**\n\n> As for just how narrow of a range SPY has traded in, in the charts below we show the distance (in percentage terms) between the intraday high and low over a rolling ten trading day span. While today's move higher lifted the reading to 1.59%, as of yesterday's close there was only 1.34% between yesterday's intraday high and last Tuesday's intraday low. Going back through the history of SPY, there have only been 146 other days, or just 2% of all days, in which that range was less than 1.5%. In fact, the last time that there was as narrow of a ten-day range as yesterday's reading was the first trading day of 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080621-Range2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Did You Know Stocks Historically Peak in Early August?\n\n> Hard to believe, but we are in August already! The good news is stocks are still firmly in a bull market, but the bad news is the calendar is a potential worry now. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, August and September have been historically two of the weakest months of the year. In fact, during a post-election year, August has been historically quite poor, with only February worse on average. Turning to September, it has indeed been historically the worst month of the year on average. Don’t forget that last year stocks saw nearly a 10% correction during this troublesome month.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Taking this a step further, stocks tend to peak in early August when a new party is in power in the White House. August 6 is the day stocks peak and they don’t bottom until September 25.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Meanwhile, during a post-election year stocks peak on August 3 and bottom on September 24. Again, showing how the next several weeks potentially can be dangerous.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> It isn’t all bad news though. With the economy rebounding and earnings soaring, should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use that as an opportunity to add to core equity positions. “The S&P 500 is up an incredible six months in a row,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What most might not realize is that is a very bullish event. In fact, one year later it has been up 18 of 21 times with nearly a 12% average return. The bull might have a few tricks up his sleeve yet.”\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Biggest Jump in Bearish Sentiment Since Last Spring\n\n> The S&P 500 has been moving sideways around record highs over the past couple of weeks. As such, bullish sentiment from the AAII was relatively flat this week. After a sizeable 5.6 percentage point jump to 36.2% last week, bullish sentiment fell 0.1 percentage points this week. With that reading, bullish sentiment is still 2 percentage points below the historical average of 38%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n> Whereas bullish sentiment did not change much, bearish sentiment surged 7.6 percentage points. That was the biggest single-week uptick since June 18th of last year when it rose 9.73 percentage points. At that time though, just under half (47.78%) of respondents reported bearish sentiment compared to only 31.7% today which is only slightly elevated versus the historical average of 30.53%. In fact, the current level of bearish sentiment is now the highest since only February. Put differently, bearish sentiment has been muted recently, and while this week's increase was large, it does not leave sentiment at any sort of extreme level.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n> In spite of the large uptick in respondents reporting as bearish, sentiment continues to favor the bulls. The bull-bear spread remains positive at 4.4.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**\n\n> Given bullish sentiment went little changed, the rise in bearish sentiment borrowed almost entirely from those reporting as neutral. Neutral sentiment fell 7.5 percentage points to 32.2%. That is the lowest reading since the first week of July, and it was the largest week-over-week decline since April 8th. This week now marks the first time in three weeks that neutral was not the predominant sentiment reading.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ReeEPIJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/fdmoWrb.jpg))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 8.9.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hH8lMzf.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 8.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fTKlB2G.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jtnox7J.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/tXNXZ9k.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  8.10.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sb3UGcw.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 8.10.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sM0vwLU.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vAXMGcN.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 8.11.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FyvZmSK.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 8.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vVGRKwV.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/cfJlP48.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 8.12.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cXwWA7L.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 8.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/j3oKw0k.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/tMaWTkc.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 8.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PRthpAN.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 8.13.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",

Numbers like this certainly help investors with their anxiety about that.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><strong>This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Bu4yplC.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/9dPtCyw.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/bpBqKiM.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Futures Markets as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZnXOGek.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/XprOFrv.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eI3Ta1u.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eE40BKp.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hVsbntP.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/C4YQ6e6.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())</strong></h6>\n\n<p>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Here are the upcoming IPO&#39;s for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/PIlKQup.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Friday&#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0wYYcgM.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5Zb324i.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!</a></strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/NrzNjWu.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/UqUPIBU.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>SPY Snoozefest Coming To An End?</h1>\n\n<p>In today&#39;s Morning Lineup, we noted how the major US equity indices have been a bit sleepy with each one having risen less than 1% over the five days ending yesterday. As shown below, that lack of volatility actually extends back to the prior week as well. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has generally trended in a sideways range over the past two weeks. That was until today. While yesterday&#39;s move higher brought SPY to the high end of that recent range, the reaction to the strong NFP report is marking a more distinct breakout.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080621-SPY.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>As for just how narrow of a range SPY has traded in, in the charts below we show the distance (in percentage terms) between the intraday high and low over a rolling ten trading day span. While today&#39;s move higher lifted the reading to 1.59%, as of yesterday&#39;s close there was only 1.34% between yesterday&#39;s intraday high and last Tuesday&#39;s intraday low. Going back through the history of SPY, there have only been 146 other days, or just 2% of all days, in which that range was less than 1.5%. In fact, the last time that there was as narrow of a ten-day range as yesterday&#39;s reading was the first trading day of 2018.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080621-Range2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Did You Know Stocks Historically Peak in Early August?</h1>\n\n<p>Hard to believe, but we are in August already! The good news is stocks are still firmly in a bull market, but the bad news is the calendar is a potential worry now. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, August and September have been historically two of the weakest months of the year. In fact, during a post-election year, August has been historically quite poor, with only February worse on average. Turning to September, it has indeed been historically the worst month of the year on average. Don’t forget that last year stocks saw nearly a 10% correction during this troublesome month.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Taking this a step further, stocks tend to peak in early August when a new party is in power in the White House. August 6 is the day stocks peak and they don’t bottom until September 25.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, during a post-election year stocks peak on August 3 and bottom on September 24. Again, showing how the next several weeks potentially can be dangerous.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>It isn’t all bad news though. With the economy rebounding and earnings soaring, should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use that as an opportunity to add to core equity positions. “The S&amp;P 500 is up an incredible six months in a row,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What most might not realize is that is a very bullish event. In fact, one year later it has been up 18 of 21 times with nearly a 12% average return. The bull might have a few tricks up his sleeve yet.”</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.2.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Biggest Jump in Bearish Sentiment Since Last Spring</h1>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 has been moving sideways around record highs over the past couple of weeks. As such, bullish sentiment from the AAII was relatively flat this week. After a sizeable 5.6 percentage point jump to 36.2% last week, bullish sentiment fell 0.1 percentage points this week. With that reading, bullish sentiment is still 2 percentage points below the historical average of 38%.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bull.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Whereas bullish sentiment did not change much, bearish sentiment surged 7.6 percentage points. That was the biggest single-week uptick since June 18th of last year when it rose 9.73 percentage points. At that time though, just under half (47.78%) of respondents reported bearish sentiment compared to only 31.7% today which is only slightly elevated versus the historical average of 30.53%. In fact, the current level of bearish sentiment is now the highest since only February. Put differently, bearish sentiment has been muted recently, and while this week&#39;s increase was large, it does not leave sentiment at any sort of extreme level.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Bear.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>In spite of the large uptick in respondents reporting as bearish, sentiment continues to favor the bulls. The bull-bear spread remains positive at 4.4.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-BB-Spread.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Given bullish sentiment went little changed, the rise in bearish sentiment borrowed almost entirely from those reporting as neutral. Neutral sentiment fell 7.5 percentage points to 32.2%. That is the lowest reading since the first week of July, and it was the largest week-over-week decline since April 8th. This week now marks the first time in three weeks that neutral was not the predominant sentiment reading.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/080521-AAII-Neutral.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>(<strong>T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h6><strong>([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())</strong></h6>\n\n<p>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ReeEPIJ.png\">CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fdmoWrb.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY&#39;S MARKET OPEN!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Monday 8.9.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hH8lMzf.png\">CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h1><strong><em>Monday 8.9.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fTKlB2G.png\">CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/jtnox7J.png\">CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/tXNXZ9k.png\">CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Tuesday  8.10.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/sb3UGcw.png\">CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h1><strong><em>Tuesday 8.10.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/sM0vwLU.png\">CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vAXMGcN.png\">CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Wednesday 8.11.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/FyvZmSK.png\">CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h1><strong><em>Wednesday 8.11.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vVGRKwV.png\">CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/cfJlP48.png\">CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Thursday 8.12.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/cXwWA7L.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h1><strong><em>Thursday 8.12.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/j3oKw0k.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/tMaWTkc.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Friday 8.13.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/PRthpAN.png\">CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Friday 8.13.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())</h6>\n\n<p>(NONE.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</h1>\n\n<p><strong>(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)</strong> (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).</p>\n\n<h1>(<a href=\"http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</h1>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>DISCUSS!</h1>\n\n<p>What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a>. :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
