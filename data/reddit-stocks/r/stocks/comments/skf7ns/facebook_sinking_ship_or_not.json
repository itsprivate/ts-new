There's obviously a lot of  controversy around the company recently  and there are good reasons for  that. However, I think they're finally  being forced to address these,  which should ultimately be good for  business.\n\nThe  current drop of  Facebook was extremely exaggerated in my personal  opinion. The drop in  users was 1 million out of... 1.93 BILLION. Less  than 0.05% loss of  users! That also comes after a pandemic boost so,  even though it's not a  great sight, it's not as bad as people make it  out to be.\n\nPlus,  the main reason  why Facebook missed earnings was due to their  investments in Reality  Labs, e.g. their AR and VR branch. Facebook's  core business actually  grew and we can also see that in their revenue  which is up 20% YoY.  Does it make sense to punish the stock for trying  to get ahead of the  market in a brand new sector? It makes no sense.  IIRC, AR and VR are  meant to be a $300 bln market within 10 years or so.  Facebook is one of  the pioneers there along with other mega-cap tech  giants. The revenue  and earnings potential there is absolutely massive  so it would make  sense for FB to try to spearhead it as much as  possible.\n\nI'm  not a fan of Zuck and co., but I think we have to admit they've built  something phenomenal  (although frightening). It's a solid business and  trading at a PE of 17  is crazy IMO. How many other companies at that PE  ratio seen revenue  growth of 20%? I mean, Coca Cola has a PE of 30!\n\nLong   story short, I'm long-term bullish although seeing how the markets   reacted, I can't see Facebook hitting $300 again in the next 3 months,   possibly 6 to 12 months. However, I think it's a good time for anyone to  add to their position which is what I'm doing (although I only own  something like 1.2 shares of FB right now).",
