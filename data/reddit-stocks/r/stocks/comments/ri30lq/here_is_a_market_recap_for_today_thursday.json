Market participants continue to digest the Fed’s latest monetary policy decision, which doubled the pace of tapering. \n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.79%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -2.57%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.10%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.02%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): +4.22%\n* Apple (AAPL): -3.93%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): -6.81%\n* Bank of America (BAC): +2.41%\n* Affirm (AFRM): -11.86% \n* Bakkt (BKKT): -33.07%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -5.03%\n* Adobe (ADBE): -10.19%\n* Rivian (RIVN): -10.75% after-hours\n\nFirst-time unemployment filings totaled 206,000[ up from last week’s half-century](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-unemployment-claims-week-ended-dec-11-2021-200522770.html) low but down overall even compared to before the pandemic, reflecting labor market tightness brought on by a lingering shortage of workers. \n\nIn Washington, President Biden signed a bill that would raise the debt limit to once again avert a default by the US government. \n\nthe Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Fed’s dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. \n\nThe new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.\n\nA quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).\n\nThe Fed said, “Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.”\n\nThe median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, clocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Fed’s September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy)\n\nThe next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Activity in the U.S. services and manufacturing sectors decelerated in early December but still held in expansionary territory, with stubbornly elevated prices looming over economic growth. \n* IHS Markit's preliminary December U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered at 57.8, coming in below November's 58.3. Consensus economists had been looking for a slight increase in the index to 58.5, according to Bloomberg data. Readings above the neutral level of 50.0 indicate expansion in a sector. \n* Housing starts rose 11.8% on a month-over-month basis in November, [the Commerce Department said on Thursday. ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)This easily topped estimates for the 3.1% increase expected\n* EV startup Rivian (RIVN) said it was building a new plant in Georgia as it looks to expand production. \n* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11% after hours after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.\n* Steven Cliff, deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and nominated for the top job, was asked about the agency's probes into Tesla auto-pilot and said \"we hope to have those investigations wrapped up soon.\" He said he did not have a \"precise timeline.\"\n* Tax preparation company H&amp;R Block Inc on Thursday sued payment company Block Inc, previously called Square Inc, saying the new name infringed its trademarks.\n* New car sales in the US are expected to rise next year, driven by pent up demand as automakers were forced to cut production in 2020 and 2021 amid the semiconductor shortage. Edmunds expects 15.2 million more cars will be sold in 2022, a 1.2% increase despite higher prices.\n\n“I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.” - Jimmy Dean",
