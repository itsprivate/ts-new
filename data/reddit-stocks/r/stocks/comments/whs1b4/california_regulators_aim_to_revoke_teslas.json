Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigating urban steets, complex intersections and freeways. To your Destination - When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you.\" \n\nBut, because the company's vehicles \"could not at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now\" operate without a driver, the marketing violates California law about advertisements using untrue claims to market their products, according to the complaints. \n\n\"Respondent made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts, in advertising vehicles as equipped, or potentially equipped, with advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features,\" the pair of complaints against Tesla's [dealership](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22127991-585743312-california-dmv-accusation-against-tesla-inc-vehicle-dealer?responsive=1&amp;title=1) and [manufacturing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22127992-585743318-california-dmv-accusation-against-tesla-inc-vehicle-manufacturer?responsive=1&amp;title=1) divisions read. \n\nThe penalty for the violations may include suspension or revocation of the company's license to sell cars in the state, as well as paying restitution to customers who were deceived by the marketing, according to the complaint.  \n\n\"The undersigned prays that the Departrnent of Motor Vehicles take such action against the license of the Respondent as is warranted by the facts of this case,\" the complaint, signed by regulator Ailene Short, the chief of the industry services branch of the DMV's occupational licensing division, read. \n\nElon Musk said in a June interview that creating reliable self-driving technology is [\"essential\" to the financial success of the company](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-worth-basically-zero-without-self-driving-2022-6).\n\n\"\\[T\\]he overwhelming focus is on solving full self-driving,\" Musk said in an interview with the YouTube channel \"Tesla Owners Silicon Valley,\" published Tuesday. \"That's essential. It's really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\"\n\nBut the billionaire has been making big promises about self-driving features for years, despite [customer complaints](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/regulators-looking-complaint-teslas-full-self-driving-software-rcna5537),  and the fact that [Teslas accounted for 273 of nearly 400 US crashes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/tesla-us-car-carashes-driver-assist-systems) involving driver-assist systems in the last year.\n\n[In 2019](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-doubles-down-on-claim-about-self-driving-tech-2019-2), Musk said he was \"certain\" that by the end of that year, Teslas \"will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. \n\n[source](https://www.businessinsider.com/california-regulators-revoke-tesla-dealer-license-over-deceptive-practices-2022-8?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds)",
