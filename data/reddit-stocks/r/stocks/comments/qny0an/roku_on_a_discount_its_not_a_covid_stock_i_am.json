Roku does produce some small series, but they don’t compete directly with other streaming services. In fact, they compete with a totally different group of companies.\n\nThey compete with other operating systems for TVs like AppleTV, ChromeOS, FireTV. ROKU is a unique Platform/OS just focused on TVs. Own the platform, and you control everything.\n\nThink of them as an advertising platform like Facebook or YouTube but with the power of AppleOS and the App Store.\n\nThink about where most ad revenue is placed. Normally Facebook & Google capture most of the Revenue. However, things got more difficult since advertisers must deal with the new Apple privacy regulations when the ad is placed within the Apple ecosystem.\n\nHere Roku presents its unique possibility for massive adoption among advertisers. Roku offers a unique OS for TVs enabling Roku to sell targeted, personalized ads to advertisers.\n\nPrimarily Roku makes money on their displayed ads, which are shown on their 20,000 Roku Channels. Developers can create channels on Roku for free, making it easy to grow to the number of channels available. Once a channel gets enough traction, it will be monetized.\n\nSecondly, Roku knows their customers and enables a more unique possibility for advertisers to show personalized targeted ads, compared to traditional TV where the customer is mostly unknown.\n\nThirdly, Roku gets a cut on every subscription placed over the RokuOS. Just like Apple gets a cut from every app you pay for… Own the platform, and you control everything.\n\nRoku recently acquired Quibi for a fraction of a price. Roku paid less than $100 million for global rights to 75-plus Quibi shows. It’s a super successful acquisition for Roku, having a wide library and a unique selling point. You can watch those shows for free by the way.\n\nHow fast is Roku growing? The annual percent growth rate of Roku users grew from Q1 2017 to Q1 2021 is at an impressive rate of 92.48% per year. (Source Statista ) \n\nThe Worldwide, demand for free TV content is massive. [$ROKU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24ROKU&src=cashtag_click) is aggressively expanding internationally and is being integrated into more TV's globally as we speak. Roku captures a unique opportunity for the global go-to Operating System on TVs.\n\nAs the No. 1 TV streaming platform in the U.S. (based on hours streamed) I am excited about the road ahead. I feel [$ROKU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24ROKU&src=cashtag_click) has a bright future ahead, given the enormous opportunity it unfolds as the go-to OS for TVs.\n\nThis is not financial advice, please do your own due diligence.
