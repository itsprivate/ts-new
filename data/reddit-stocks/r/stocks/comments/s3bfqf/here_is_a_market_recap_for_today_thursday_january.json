Still, new filings remain near pre-pandemic levels. Continuing jobless claims improved to their lowest level since 1973. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 230,000 vs. 200,000 expected and an unrevised 207,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims:** 1.559 million vs. 1.733 million expected and a revised 1.753 million during prior week\n\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.\n\nOmar Aguilar, Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab Asset Management, said “The inflation picture obviously is something that people are trying to understand — the concept of PPI and the fact that we're getting ... numbers that we haven't seen in quite some time. The labor market seems to continue to be very tight and very strong, and I think investors are trying to understand what the implications might be for the reaction of the central bank.”\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm)\n\nThe PPI comes the day after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices for consumer goods rose 7.0% year-over-year, the fastest pace of inflation since 1982. CPI matched consensus estimates and showed a minor acceleration compared to November 6.8% print.\n\nBy category, prices for used cars and trucks and shelter were the largest contributors to the headline increase. The used cars and trucks index rose for a third straight month and accelerated to a 3.5% month-on-month rise in December from November's 2.5% increase. This index was also higher by a marked 37.3% compared to the same month last year. Shelter prices rose 0.4%.  \n\nThe core measure of consumer price changes, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 5.5% in December over last year, representing the fastest increase since 1991. This accelerated from a 4.9% annual gain in November.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)\n\nTo close out the week, banks are scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Friday as earnings season kicks off. The S&amp;P 500 Financials sector ETF XLF set a fresh record intraday high again on Wednesday, marking its fourth record in the eight trading days so far in 2022 as investors gear up for quarterly reports from BlackRock (BLK), Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC).\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Private equity firm TPG (TPG) debuted on the market today, the first major IPO of 2022. Shares closed their first day of trading roughly 15% higher. \n* Banking app Dave.com (DAVE) also debuted in the market today via merger, with shares closing the day roughly 19% higher. \n* Shares of Ford Motors (F) outperformed the market today, with the company’s market cap topping $100 billion for the first time in roughly 20 years as investors cheer the pivot into EVs.\n* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) rose after reporting fourth-quarter earnings results. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.15 on revenue of $15.7 billion. Revenue grew 24.1% year-over-year. Moreover, the company said it was planning to invest $40-$44 billion to expand capacity.\n* Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter earnings that came in line with Wall Street estimates, The airline posted adjusted earnings per share of 22 cents on revenue of $8.4 billion. Revenue in the fourth quarter was 74% recovered compared to pre-pandemic levels, and up 8 percentage points from Q3 2021.\n* Microsoft is investing $50 million in a LanzaJet facility in Georgia that will produce jet fuel from ethanol next year, LanzaJet said. LanzaJet, based in Chicago, said it has nearly completed on-site engineering at its Freedom Pines Fuels Biorefinery, with plans to start producing 10 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel per year from sustainable ethanol by 2023.\n* General Motors (GM) said a trio of chips from Qualcomm Inc will power the \"Ultra Cruise\" driver-assistance feature on a luxury Cadillac sedan next year.\n* Microsoft Corp hired a key Apple Inc engineer Mike Filippo, who worked in the development of Apple’s in-house chip, to design its own in-house server chips, according to a report by Bloomberg. The cloud computing heavy-weight relies heavily on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc to supply chips for its Azure cloud computing services as well as Surface PCs.\n\n“If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.” *-Steve Jobs*",
