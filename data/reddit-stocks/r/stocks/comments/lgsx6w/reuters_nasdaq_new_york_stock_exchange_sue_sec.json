The plan “would make equity markets overly complex and increase hidden costs for investors”, the statement said.</p>\n\n<p>The filings were made in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n\n<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Cboe Global Markets, which operates the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was also suing the SEC over the issue. Cboe did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The lawsuit is the latest legal action taken by the exchanges against the SEC in recent years, which include a successful challenge to a proposed experiment by the SEC to cap trading fees on 1,400 different stocks.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC is also dealing with other suits. In October, Citadel Securities sued the commission over its decision to approve a new mechanism for trading stocks at exchange operator IEX Group Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Edwina Gibbs</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
