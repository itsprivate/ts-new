The share price went from $20 in March 2020, to $336 in February 2021 and now is 75% down from its all-time high to $85.\n\nSo, I decided to analyze and value the company and figure out how it makes money, how it performed in the past, and what could be expected from it in the future.\n\nBelow is my analysis:\n\nFiverr is one of the most popular freelancing platforms out there and it takes around 27% of the price that the buyer pays (UpWork's take-rate is around 15%). Here's how it does that:\n\nThe freelancers (providers of jobs) list their services, which are known as gigs, and provide their prices. However, 20% of that price goes to Fiverr as a fee. On top of that, they charge 5.5% of the price to the buyer as a \"service fee\", which could be much higher as for the gigs below $50, they add an additional $2 fee.\n\nHistorically, they managed to grow every year and especially in 2020 due to the pandemic as a lot of people lost their jobs and had to find another source of income. The revenue growth was as follows:\n\n2018: 45%\n\n2019: 42% (There were indications that the growth rates should be expected to decline)\n\n2020: 77% (The impact of the pandemic)\n\n2021: 56%\n\nThis growth came both in an increase of users, but also the amount of $ spent per user, both are very important metrics and it is clear that the platform solves an important problem.\n\nWith this growth, the 2021 revenue is close to $300m. For comparison purposes, the market cap is over $3bn at the moment (at the peak, it was $12bn). Of course, there are a lot of expenses to cover until we get to the operating profit - the true business profitability.\n\nThe first part to cover is the direct costs (cost of revenue) - which are roughly 13% and are related to payment processing fees, server hosting as well as customer support. These expenses increase as the revenue increases.\n\nSo, they're left with a gross margin of 87%.\n\nBased on the historical performance, below are the other expenses incurred by Fiverr:\n\n\\- R&amp;D (30% of revenue in 2017 --&gt; 26% in 2021\n\n\\- Marketing &amp; Sales (65% of revenue in 2017 --&gt; 55% in 2021)\n\n\\- SG&amp;A ($16.2% of revenue in 2017 --&gt; $16.6% in 2021)\n\nAlthough the expenses relative to the revenue have been decreasing, the gross margin of 87% is not sufficient to cover all of them, so the company doesn't have (yet) a positive operating margin.\n\nI will not spend too much time analyzing the balance sheet as it can be summarized in two sentences:\n\n\\- The balance sheet size is 900m, out of which 65% is cash, short-term investments, and long-term investments\n\n\\- On the other side, they have a debt of roughly 400m, which is not significant as it can be covered with their liquid assets.\n\nIn a nutshell, we have a company that has good growth and good financial health based on the numbers derived from the financial statements. The question is, what can be expected from it in the future?\n\nBelow are my assumptions:\n\nRevenue growth:\n\n\\- In the next 12 months - 25% (Analysts forecast between 20% and 29%)\n\n\\- For the 4 years following - 22% (Not as high as the growth they had in the past, but still reasonable)\n\n\\- After these 5 years, to slowly decline to the risk-free rate\n\nOperating margin:\n\n\\- To increase to 22%, the revenue will be growing, while the expenses will be growing at a slower pace. When I analyzed UpWork, I forecasted a lower operating margin, but it's worth noting that the take-rate of UpWork is much lower, so we have a different starting point\n\nReinvestment (Sales to capital) of 4 --&gt; For every $4 in revenue, I forecast that they need to invest $1, whether that is in PPE, working capital, or for the acquisition of another company.\n\nThe outcome that I got was **$49.16/share**, which is way below the current share price of $85.31.\n\nOf course, I know that not only I could be wrong, but there is also a 0% chance that I'll accurately forecast the next 10 years. So, below is a table that estimates the fair value of Fiverr based on different scenarios related to the expected revenue (in 10 years from now) and the operating margin:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|22%|24%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|3x ($0.8b)|$31.3|$34.7|$38.1|\n|4.4x ($1.2b)|$44.3|$49.2|$54.1|\n|5x ($1.4b)|$49.8|$55.3|$60.9|\n|7x ($1.9b)|$67.5|$75.1|$82.6|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is a good sanity check to convert their revenue back to the value of the services that should be provided through their platform which represents the total amount that the buyers would pay. In 2021, the revenue is close to $300m, using the take-rate of 27%, the buyers are paying around $1.1b.\n\nIn the last scenario that I have listed here, if the revenue grows 7x (which I think there's a very low likelihood of happening) and if the operating margin expands to 24% (which is also a challenge), the fair value is $82.6 and is still below the current market price.\n\nTo me, this is a reminder that the fear of missing out to invest in a disruptive company can lead to pushing the price to a point where it makes no sense. Just a reminder, it was as high as $336/share, with a market cap of $12b. I personally do not see any reasons from a fundamental point of view that puts the value even close to that.",
