That came in slightly ahead of expectations for $3.46 billion.\n\nGap said its sales figure was hit by an estimated 5 percentage points related to the retailer lapping a year-ago lift from stimulus checks, in addition to roughly 3 percentage points from divestitures, store closures and transitioning its European business to a partnership model.\n\nOverall, same-store sales fell 14% from the prior year, more than the 12.2% drop that analysts had been looking for. Within that figure, Gap said its online sales declined 17% and in-store sales dropped 10% versus last year.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of same-store sales performance, by brand:\n\n* Gap: Down 11% year over year\n* Old Navy: Down 22% year over year\n* Banana Republic: up 27% year over year\n* Athleta: down 7%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the fiscal year 2022, Gap now expects to earn between 30 cents and 60 cents per share, on an adjusted basis. That’s down from a prior range of 1.85 and $2.05. And well below analysts’ expectations for $1.34 per share, based on Refinitiv data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/26/gap-gps-reports-q1-2022-earnings.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/26/gap-gps-reports-q1-2022-earnings.html)",
