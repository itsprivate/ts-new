This is probably very elementary stuff, and I’m sure there are technical terms that I am unaware of.\n\nWhen I say scoop, I mean a stock that ramped up at some point then quickly dropped back down. After that, stocks seem to stay low and keep dropping but at a slower and slower rate. Eventually it evens out and starts to climb back up, usually to about 75% of its previous peak.\n\nSo my goal has been to find stocks that just finished leveling out and are starting to “scoop” back up to that 75%.\n\nI have been viewing this trend in 3m, 6m, 1yr, and 5yr ranges because I don’t have an interest in day trading, and I prefer a slower, safer climb.\n\nSo I have a few questions:\n\n1. Is this a decent approach?\n\n2. Does it have a name?\n\n3. Are there other good companies out there showing a similar mid-to-long-term trends that I should look into?\n\nOf course, I’m not asking for or giving financial advice. Thanks!",
