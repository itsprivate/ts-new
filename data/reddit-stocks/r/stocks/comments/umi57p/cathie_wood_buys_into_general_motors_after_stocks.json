Wood’s firm made the purchase nearly two weeks after the company posted quarterly earnings that beat estimates.\n\nWhile GM moves toward developing a range of battery-powered vehicles, Wood’s firm has been selling shares of electric-vehicle bellwether Tesla Inc. in at least each of the last four quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \n\nARK’s daily trading updates show only active decisions by the management team and don’t include creation or redemption activity caused by investor flows. The firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF is close to erasing gains it held over the S&amp;P 500 Index after rotating toward value from growth amid the economic reopening and rising U.S. Treasury yields.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-buys-into-general-motors-after-stock-s-steep-slide-1.1763730",
