The Tesla CEO also said this is contradictory to Gates' desire to fight climate change and that he should be supporting Tesla's electric vehicle development.\n\nIn an interview with a French YouTube channel \"Hugo Decrypte\" that was aired on Thursday, Gates was asked if Musk is right in taking such a stance.\n\nGates responded by saying. Tesla isn't short of capital, and the company has done a \"fantastic job.\" He also said the company's cars are great.\n\nThe Microsoft Corporation founder noted that he gives a lot more money to efforts addressing climate change than Musk or anyone else for that matter.\n\nGates pointed out that cars account for only 16% of emissions, and the other 84% also needs to be solved. Although he acknowledged that Musk has \"done a great job.\" \n\n\"Somebody shorting his stock doesn't slow him down or hurt him in any way,\" Gates added.\n\nAs recently as late last month, Musk in a Twitter chat with his followers said Gates' Tesla short bet may have ballooned, and the latter would need about $1.5 billion to $2 billion to cover the short position.'\n\nSource: benzinga.com/news/22/06/27556119/bill-gates-explains-why-his-tesla-short-position-shouldnt-hurt-elon-musk",
