C. Wei told an online earnings briefing, calling it a \"mega-trend\" in the industry supported by demand for 5G and artificial intelligence, as well as an increase in chips used in gadgets.\n&gt;\n&gt;TSMC is working to address supply chain challenges with tool suppliers, he added, referring to a cycle of shortages where makers of chip equipment are struggling to find the chips needed for equipment to supply chipmakers like TSMC.\n&gt;\n&gt;The company, which also has customers such as Qualcomm Inc , has previously said it expected strong growth to accelerate in coming years due to robust demand for chips that power everything from smartphones to cars. It has already lifted capital spending for this year.\n&gt;\n&gt;The company on Thursday said net profit for the January-March quarter jumped 45% from a year earlier to T$202.7 billion ($7 billion). Analysts expected a profit of T$184.67 billion, according to an average of 19 estimates compiled by Refinitiv.\n&gt;\n&gt;The first quarter was supported by better-than-expected demand from smartphone customers and high performance computing chips, as well as strong demand for auto related chips, Wei said.\n&gt;\n&gt;Revenue climbed 36% to $17.57 billion, beating market expectations, and above the company's own estimated range of $16.6 billion to $17.2 billion.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-tsmc-forecasts-q2-sales-054154312.html\n\nhttps://investor.tsmc.com/english/quarterly-results/2022/q1",
