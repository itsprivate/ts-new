With no new economic data being released this week and the year coming to a close, volume in the market has dried up, with volume in SPY coming in at roughly 50% average volume. I expect the market to be mostly flat for the rest of the week then pick up once again in 2022.\n\n**Notable Numbers**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.13%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): Closed even\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.24%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.13%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -4.16%\n* Biogen (BIIB): +9.57%\n* FuelCell Energy (FCEL): -12.95%\n* Astra Space (ASTR): -14.14%\n\nOn Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)\n\n, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. \n\nData shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission \"occurs early in the course of illness,\" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.\n\n\"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\\\\\n\n, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. \n\nData shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission \"occurs early in the course of illness,\" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.\n\n\"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\n\nErin Gibbs. Chief Investment Officer at Main Street Asset Management, said “We encourage our clients to stay in the markets, not to get out, because when those recoveries hit and when the sentiment changes, it happens so quickly that often by the time you get back into the market, you’ve already missed out.” Remember, time in the market is always better than timing the market.\n\nFirst-time unemployment filings are expected to tick up slightly from last week’s reading but remain near pre-pandemic lows, signaling a continued recovery in the labor market as high demand for workers pours into the new year.\n\n“We’re facing some headwinds that could challenge the bull market continuing to run,” Sound Planning Group CEO David Stryzewski told Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re looking at a 40-year inflation... the consumer's continued relatively strong… we’re looking at interest rates right now at 40-year lows.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has sold another 934,090 shares, or about $1.02 billion worth of his holdings, in his electric car company according to financial filings published late Tuesday.\n* The National Association of Realtors’ (NAR) [Pending Home Sales Index dropped 2.2%](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pending-home-sales-november-2021-150010616.html) in November from the prior month, missing analyst expectations. The index, which tracks the number of homes that are under contract to be sold, serves as a leading indicator of the housing market's health.\n* The [U.S. trade deficit in goods ballooned](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-goods-trade-deficit-hits-135842273.html) to a record in November as imports soared and exports fell. The Commerce Department reported that the goods trade deficit expanded by 17.5% last month to $97.8 billion from $83.2 billion in October. The new figure tops the previous record deficit of $97 billion posted in September. Goods exports declined 2.1%, while imports rose by 4.7%.\n* Amid the intense regulatory crackdown, the top 10 richest tech executives in China have lost a combined $80 billion. Pinduoduo Inc. founder Colin Huang lost the most this year -- $42.9 billion, or two-thirds of his fortune -- as shares of the e-commerce platform plunged from a high of $212 to just $54\n* Ford Motors (F) is slightly more valuable than General Motors for the first time since 2016.\n* Apple supplier Foxconn Technology Group on Wednesday said it was restructuring its local management at its Sriperumbudur facility in southern India amid a strike by workers there. \n* According to a report by Bloomberg, Alibaba (BABA) will likely divest its stake from Twitter-like platform Weibo amid regulatory pressure. \n* Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant Group will cease operation of its online crowdfunded medical aid program Xianghubao on Jan. 28 citing “significant changes’ amid the country’s regulatory crackdown. It really has not been a good year for Chinese stocks\n\n“Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.\" -*Babe Ruth*",
