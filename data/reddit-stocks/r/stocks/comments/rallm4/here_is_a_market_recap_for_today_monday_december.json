  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 6, 2021**\n\nAfter last week’s extremely volatile trading, stocks bounced on Monday, as investors continued weighing the potential impact of the new coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. \n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.18%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.80%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.90%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.01%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -7.80%\n* Del Taco (TACO): +65.60%\n* BioNTech (BNTX): -18.34%\n* Moderna (MRNA): -13.49%\n* Airbnb (ABNB): +8.46%\n* Crude Oil (WTI): +4.44%\n\nSome encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today. During an appearance on CNN today, Fauci said that preliminary data and reports coming out of South Africa, where Omicron was originally discovered November 24, suggest the severity of the virus is not as bad as originally feared. Fauci said, “Clearly, in South Africa, omicron has a transmission advantage. And although it’s too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it. But we’ve really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe, or really doesn’t cause any severe illness comparable to delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity.” \n\nLike I said last week during my recaps, it was way too early to panic regarding Omicron, I remember the same song and dance happening after the discovery of Delta, which ended up being one of the juiciest dips all year. It’s still too early to make any conclusions, but the data is so far very encouraging. I’m personally nibbling at some stocks last week and today. \n\nMeanwhile, however, Moderna (MRNA) President Stephen Hoge told ABC on Sunday that there was a \"real risk that we're going to see a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccines\" currently available as the Omicron variant spreads. The vaccine-maker had also said last week it could have a COVID-19 booster shot designed to address the Omicron variant available as soon as March. CEO Stephane Bancel said something very similar last week. Not to be too conspiratorial, but it is in the interest of these companies to produce a new booster vaccine to boost profits. I personally trust public health officials over CEOs and executives, though again, more data is needed to make any conclusions.\n\nJ. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. \n\nPowell said, ““We tend to use \\[the word transitory\\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”\n\nMoreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. \n\nAgain, this is simply my humble opinion. As I have said for months at this point, I am unconcerned regarding tapering the pace of quantitative easing. I remain bullish until the Fed begins concretely discussing plans to raise the interest rate, which the Fed currently telegraphs to happen around the middle of next year, according to the Fed’s dot-plot. Again, this is simply my opinion, don’t get too worked up about it (been weirdly getting a lot of aggressive comments because of this opinion from doom and gloomers). As always, I acknowledge the risks and am prepared to act if it turns out I am incorrect.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock gapped down in the morning, before mostly recovering by market close, after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was investigating a report from a whistleblower that alleges that Tesla did not properly inform buyers that defective electrical connectors on the panel could cause fires.\n* Lucid Motors (LCID), another EV company, is also being investigated by the SEC. Lucid said the probe “appears to concern” the merger that took the company public along with “certain projections and statements” made by the company prior to becoming public. \n* The Nasdaq Inc is geared to eclipse rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in initial public offerings (IPO) this year, which has seen companies raise record levels of capital. Nasdaq raised a total of $191.38 billion through IPOs in 2021, compared with $109.25 billion raised at the NYSE, according to data from Dealogic.\n* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) broke (at least briefly) from its death spiral to climb roughly 10% after the company announced it was reorganizing its e-commerce team and naming a new Chief Financial Officer in the face of tightening regulation, increasing competition, slowing growth, and a more than 60% loss in stock price.\n* The Department of Justice opened an investigation into allegations that Apple (AAPL) is unevenly enforcing its rules for app developers, favoring some like Roblox (RBLX) at the expense of others.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) won Yahoo Finance company of the year\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) coverage initiated by KeyCorp with a price target of $191 and a rating of Overweight.\n* Broadcom (AVGO) with two target raises. Stock currently around $565\n   * JP Morgan from $600 to $655 at Overweight\n   * UBS Group from $580 to $660 at Buy. \n* American Express (AXP) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $209 to $211 at Overweight. Stock currently around $160\n* Capital One (COF) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $214 to $221 at Overweight. Stock currently around $145\n* Ingersoll Rand (IR) target raised by Barclays from $63 to $70 at Overweight. Stock currently around $59\n* Marvell Technology (MRVL) target raised by Argus from $74 to $105 at Buy. Stock currently around $86\n* Micron Technology (MU) target raised by Cowen from $80 to $99 at Outperform. Stock currently around $82\n* Signature Bank of New York (SBNY) with a massive target raise by Morgan Stanley from $400 to $475 at Overweight. Stock currently around $311. Very notable.\n* Snowflake (SNOW) target raised by Credit Suisse from $455 to $465 at Outperform. Stock currently $340\n* Ulta Beauty (ULTA) target raised by Barclays from $492 to $516 at Overweight. Stock currently around $390\n\n“In my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not a risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?” - Li Lu",
