First of all, the traders can have time to both trade stocks and teach courses. Surely with all the algorithms and with partners/assitants, they can make time to teach courses. Now, maybe the money they&#39;d make from these courses would be such a drop in the bucket compared to their stock earnings, making it again pointless. I&#39;m not sure about this, but a friend of mine is paying a quite sizeable sum for a trading course, and in this digital age, he could be one of many. So, perhaps there is a lot of money to make on this.</p>\n\n<p>As for the second point: surely there are many instances where cooperation is most beneficial. As a teacher of a course, one has a lot of influence over the students, being able to perhaps tell them to invest in certain businesses that would benefit them all.</p>\n\n<p>So, from my point of view, it doesn&#39;t make sense that being a teacher in a stock trading course means that one is most likely scamming the students. What do you guys think about this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
