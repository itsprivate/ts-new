I’ve had some education in the bio realm and have read up on crispr since years ago so this is exciting stuff. I definitely want to invest and am now just trying to choose which route I want to choose. Usually I am opposed to ETFs and would rather just go with individual stocks as I don’t worry too much about the risk. However the ARKG etf does have a very attractive array of genomics/biotech companies. On the other hand I do feel good on hopping on Intellia or Crispr and riding out the next couple years as well. (Don’t got enough funds right now to invest in the etf and individual stocks)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
