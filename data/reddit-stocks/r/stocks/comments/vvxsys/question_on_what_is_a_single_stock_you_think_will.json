Yes, so far it has just been going down and down with the exception of the last week but there are some solid stocks to buy and hold for the short/mid term. Here are my current recent picks: \n\nSONY = Strong company, good fundamentals and overall a brand name most people alive today have used. Does not deserve the current price it is at ($82). Current holdings = 6 shares. \n\nAAPL = Same as above except it does not deserve to be as low as where it is at currently ($147). Current holdings = 97 shares. \n\nDIS = Disney, yes Disney is down nearly 40% YTD. I see this stock soaring as oil prices ease, which in my opinion is a main contributor as to why it is so low currently (not the main contributor though). I see this stock as a win if we do go into a recession or do not go into a recession. If no recession happens the parks and merchandise will go back to pre-COVID profits. If we do have a recession then in my opinion Disney+ will keep pumping in funds. Current price of $95 and I see it going above $130 by end of December. Current holdings = 44 shares. \n\nWFC = Wells Fargo should be well above the current price of $40 per share. The pros all agree [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WFC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WFC) (Citi for example went from neutral to buy in April). Current holdings = 61 shares but will be buying up 14 more tomorrow since this is my most favored stock to buy for a mid term hold.",
