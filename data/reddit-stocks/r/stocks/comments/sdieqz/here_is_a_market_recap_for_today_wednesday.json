  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 26, 2022**\n\nStocks closed lower in yet another volatile session as market participants digested the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference afterward. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rose by more than 2% to reach session highs just after the release of the Fed's statement at 2 pm EST. The index turned negative during Powell's press conference, closing lower for the fifth time in six sessions, extending this week’s insane volatility.\n\nThe Central Bank reiterated that the start of interest rate hikes is nearing as the economy progresses while inflation remains hot. Earnings season continues with many notable companies, including Tesla (TSLA) reporting after the bell. \n\n**Markets Today (from highs to lows)**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.86% to -0.25%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +2.96% to -0.16%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.37% to -0.44%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.21% to -1.44%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -7.33% to +1.93%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.51% to -0.06%\n* Shopify (SHOP): 5.39% to -2.63%\n* Cloudflare (NET): +5.80% to -5.56%\n* Upstart (UPST): +11.84% to +1.96%\n* Occidental Petroleum (OXY): +4.04% to +0.79%\n* Groupon (GRPN): +20.02%\n* Sierra Oncology (SRRA): +26.28%\n\nAll eyes were on the Federal Reserve, which released their monthly monetary policy statement today. In its first policy-setting meeting of 2022, the Fed reiterated that US economic activity and the labor market continue to improve despite the emergence of the Omicron COVID variant. \n\nHowever, rising inflation is weighing on members of the Fed, who signaled that the interest raise needs to rise soon to combat inflation. Higher rates could address inflation by raising borrowing costs and dampening demand — particularly for goods.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said, “With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March”. It is likely the first interest hike will come either in March or April, after the Fed completes tapering.\n\nHere is the entire statement: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf)\n\nIn his press conference following the meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said, “I would say that the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming conditions are appropriate for doing so. \n\nBut the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee unanimously agreed that “it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,” and Powell’s commentary suggests the first increase will happen on March 16.\n\nDavid Bailin, Chief Investment Officer at Citi Global Wealth Management, said “If you think about what's happened in the markets, it indicates the degree of sensitivity market participants have to what is going to be the new rate environment and the new liquidity environment. The Fed made a major reversal about five weeks ago when it said that it was both going to raise rates and also consider quantitative tightening, which effectively means that you and I are going to have to finance the debt that is necessary issued by the Treasury instead of the Fed. So with all of that, I think they're going to look at what happened \\[in markets\\] and they're going to say, our goal here is not to shut the economy and to make things slow. The goal here is to signal their willingness to fight inflation to the extent that they can.\n\nAfter the bell, Tesla (TSLA) reported fourth-quarter results that beat analyst estimates in both EPS and revenue despite the company warning that supply chain issues could persist through 2022. Here are the numbers: \n\n* **Earnings:** $2.52 per share, vs. $2.36 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $17.72 billion, vs. $16.57 billion expected, up 65% YoY\n* **Auto Sales:** $15.97 billion, up 71% YoY\n* **Energy Generation &amp; Storage:** $688 million vs $815.5 million expected, down 8% YoY\n* **Gross Margin:** 27.4% vs 26.6% the previous quarter\n* **Net Income**: $2.32 billion, up a staggering 760% YoY\n\nThe company said, “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* New home sales in the US jumped to a nine-month high, indicating strengthening demand despite high prices and limited inventory. Purchases rose 11.9% from a month earlier to an 811,000 annualized pace, better than the 760,000 expected.\n* The trade deficit reached $101.0 billion in the final month of 2021, growing from November's upwardly revised $98.0 billion deficit, according to [new data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday. ](https://www.census.gov/econ/indicators/advance_report.pdf)Consensus economists had expected the trade deficit to narrow to $96.0 billion.\n* General Motors (GM) plans to hire 8,000 new additional employees to accelerate the development of the EV and software services division.\n* Ford Motor Co and longtime Chinese partner Jiangling Motors Corp have formed a joint venture aimed at strengthening Ford's sales efforts and reach in China, the companies said Wednesday. The partnership aims to sell Ford passenger vehicles -- mainly SUVs and vans -- built by JMC through a network of 181 showrooms in major Chinese cities.\n* Snap Inc. has been training businesses to introduce products via AR camera overlays in its Snapchat app, so users can, for example, digitally try on a new lipstick shade or style of shoe. Now the company says businesses can add more information on top of their augmented reality advertisements, such as item descriptions, prices, and links to purchase.\n* Mattel’s (MAT) stock surged after the company won the license to make toys based on Disney’s “Frozen” franchise, taking the property away from rival Hasbro (HAS).\n* A €1.06 billion ($1.2 billion) fine levied against Intel back in 2009 by the European Commission has been wiped out. In a [press release announcing the ruling](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2022-01/cp220016en.pdf) (PDF) handed down on Wednesday morning, the General Court of the European Union said the financial assumption underlying the fine was based on faulty economic analysis. \n* Intel reported earnings that beat analyst estimates and delivers upbeat guidance. Here are the numbers\n   * **EPS:** $1.09, adjusted, versus $0.91 expected\n   * **Revenue:** $19.5 billion, adjusted, versus $18.31 billion expected, up 2.8% YoY\n   * **Data Center:** $7.3 billion vs $6.7 billion expected, up 20% YoY\n   * **Client Computing Group:** $10.1 billion vs $9.6 billion, down -7% YoY\n\n\"Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.\" -*Winston S. Churchill*",
