This is what is called a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp\">share dilution</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Going further through the proxy statement document, we have the details for Proposal 4 — Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock <strong>from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares</strong> <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/6Myo5r7.png\">https://i.imgur.com/6Myo5r7.png</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Description of the Proposed Amendment\nOur Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,\nand two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nOn April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to <strong>increase the number of\nauthorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the\nproposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock\nfor general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is\nadvisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for\nadoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the\ndate that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed\nAmendment <strong>would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for</strong>\ngeneral corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, <em>expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions,\nincluding shares we would be obligated to issue</em> <strong>in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited</strong>; stock\ndividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional\ncapital. Such issuances would occur <strong>without further action or approval of our stockholders</strong> and would be subject to and\nlimited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the\npotential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval</strong> of the Proposed Amendment to increase the number of\nauthorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Other parts I found interesting in their 10-K form (same doc, pg91):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>they make a <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/bk38IIf.png\">statement regarding the pending acquisition of ARM</a>; TLDR; they put a downpayment on it; they say it will happen, and they give an estimate for Q1 2022. also, softbank get paid lotsa $$ and shares. if it doesn&#39;t happen for whatever reasons, the company <em>may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell products</em></li>\n<li>they specialize in the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/b4unjGl.png\">gaming, professional visualisation (VR), data center, and automotive industries</a>;  gaming &amp; data center 🚀</li>\n<li>they talk about <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/3ROHfMe.png\">risks and risk strategy</a>; they are reliant on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. to manufacture our semiconductors</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7GkYKdp.png\">stock performance graph</a></li>\n<li>volatility in the crypto markets and Ethereum 2.0 could increase the demand for NVDA products</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vgnFfOA.png\">no pressing financial troubles; <strong>53% yoy revenue increase</strong></a> to ~$16.7bn</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ORxkEEM.png\">liquidity and authorization to repurchase stock up to $7bn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/63Wrt6N.png\">non-cancelable operating leases lower till 2027</a>; i wonder what they&#39;re planning for 2027 - is that when they&#39;re predicting people will go back to working from offices? expanding data center business?</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/XUOQV8e.png\">assets allocation</a> - mostly in the US</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gR6EUR3.png\">top revenues</a> from Taiwan and China, <strong>🚀US up 362% yoy</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Please go through the document by yourselves (link at the top). I am not experienced, nor that smart. I did not read everything in the document.</p>\n\n<p>I am thinking to vote for approval of proposal 4. In my opinion it is good for the long term. Please remember you are responsible for your own financial decisions. I hold a low amount of shares, and I&#39;ll be holding for the long term.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: please comment if you downvote. I&#39;m here to learn.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
