Market participants continue to weigh surging coronavirus cases throughout the world thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant. \n\n**Notable Numbers:** \n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.08%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.46%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.29%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.61%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -0.79%\n* Krispy Kreme (DNUT): +10.85%\n* Allbirds (BIRD): -11.39%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): -4.3%\n\nOn Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)\n\nFor context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December\n\n[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)\n\nIn light of Omicron’s lessened severity, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. \n\nData shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission \"occurs early in the course of illness,\" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.\n\n\"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\\\\\n\nThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index showed prices for homes in the US continue to moderate for the third straight month, though numbers remain very elevated. The index, which tracks average home prices in metropolitan areas posted a 19.1% annual gain in October, down from 19.7% from September. The 20-City Composite posted an 18.4% annual gain, down from 19.1% a month earlier. The 20-City results came in very close to analysts’ expectations of an 18.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007)\n\nThe rest of the week is expected to be mostly quiet for investors, with trading volumes low and little economic data and earnings releases.\n\nLooking ahead, the market will head into 2022 with  two key considerations to weigh: the course the pandemic takes and rising inflationary pressures and the Fed’s reaction to such pressures.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* U.S. President Joe Biden is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as vice chairwoman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, according to a Wall Street Journal Report.\n* Fortinet (FTNT) a cybersecurity stock, was the best performing tech stock in the S&amp;P 500, rising roughly 150% year-to-date.\n* A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn of inflating the number of people who watched video ads so the networking platform could overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.\n* US reality star Paris Hilton launches a new metaverse business, called “Paris World’, on Roblox (RBLX). While I’m a proponent of the metaverse, it’s not surprising to see people trying to cash in on the hype. \n* For the first time since 2016, the S&amp;P 500 is set to outperform the Nasdaq this year. As of yesterday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 28% this year compared to Nasdaq’s 23%. This underscores the rotation out of tech witnessed in 2021.\n* Elon Musk is drawing anger from Chinese officials after the country submitted a complaint to the UN’s space agency alleging China’s space station Tiangong, which is currently being constructed in lower atmosphere, was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with two SpaceX satellites\n* The new Spiderman movie ‘No Way Home’ has absolutely demolished box office records this year, already grossing more than $1 billion since its Dec 17 theatrical release, selling more than double the tickets as the runner-up. I watched it… it was an amazing movie.\n\n“You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don't try.\" *Beverly Sills*",
