With the rollout of the new electric models in Europe, Ford said it now expects annual sales of electric cars in Europe to exceed 600,000 units in 2026. The company is targeting the sale of 2 million electric cars globally by 2026.\n\nThe carmaker said it is also targeting zero emissions for all vehicle sales in Europe and carbon neutrality across its European footprint by 2035. “Ford is all-in and moving fast to meet the demand in Europe and around the globe,” Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said.\n\nThe new models of electric cars to be rolled out in Europe include a medium-sized crossover and an electric version of the Ford Puma, Ford’s top-selling passenger car in Europe. The Puma will be manufactured starting in 2024 at the company’s site in Craiova, Romania, which Ford said will play a significant role in the company’s electric vehicle growth plans in Europe.\n\nTo support its production efforts, Ford said it signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with SK On Co. Ltd. and Koc Holding to create one of Europe’s largest commercial vehicle battery production sites in Turkey.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-to-release-new-electric-cars-in-europe-by-2024-271647253645?mod=mw\\_quote\\_news](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-to-release-new-electric-cars-in-europe-by-2024-271647253645?mod=mw_quote_news)",
