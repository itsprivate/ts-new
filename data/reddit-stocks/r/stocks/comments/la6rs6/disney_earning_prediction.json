DIS has been beating analysts in Q2 and Q3.</p>\n\n<p>Disney parks are reported busy and on capacity limit in Q4, especially in December. They raised limit from 25% to 35% as well. So this shall adds very positively to Q4 revenue.</p>\n\n<p>Disney + subscribers at 87M on Dec 2, over 74M at end of Q3.</p>\n\n<p>With all the revenue increase and recent layoffs, and in Q2 &amp; Q3 they both posted about 15B revenue &amp; close to breakeven profit --- It looks an easy setup for DIS to beat Q4 eps again, and match 15.8B revenue. <strong>My conservative estimate is about 15.7B revenue, and -0.1 EPS. But my high estimate have them on &gt;16B revenue and 0.15 EPS.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disney + subscribers:</strong> the key growth driver. <strong>My lowest estimate is 92M, and my average estimate is 94---96M, high-end is 100M.</strong></p>\n\n<p>From NFLX ER, NFLX increased 4M in Oct -- Nov, and another 4M in Dec. They have better increase rate in Dec due to holiday season and Covid lockdown in some countries.</p>\n\n<p>From Comcast ER, Peacork increased 13M subscriber in Q4.</p>\n\n<p>From DIS investor day, we know DIS + increased 13M in Oct -- Nov alone. And they have Mulan, Mando last 3 episodes, Soul on Disney +, all after 12.2 (Investor day cut-off result for 87M subscribers).</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above information, Disney + at least should have 5M more subscribers in Dec, and potentially 10M or more =&gt; bringing the total to 92---100M.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, it will be a big feat for Disney +. If it does break 100M, the media will be crazy about its growth, and potentially dethroning NFLX in 2022. Stock -&gt; 200+.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stock Price:</strong> Comcast increased 3% after ER, NFLX 10% (and at one time almost 20%). Assuming DIS on 2.11 closes around 170 (since it never gets any attention, despite the growth picture being very clear now); and the results match the prediction --- <strong>stock will likely trade in 180---200 post ER, depending on how large they beat; with a potential to over 200 if they have &gt;100M subscriber.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure: I have DIS leaps expiring after 2022. My long-term DIS target price is 200--300 this year, and 300--400 in 2022--2023.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, all ER comes with some risk, so be cautious with any weekly option bets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
