These are just my opinions and do not represent the views of this community.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier today I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/explodinghedgefunds/comments/l8jed7/gme_autistic_epiphany/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">tried to debunk</a> the fUnDaMeNtAlS argument against holding shares at these new prices.</p>\n\n<p>Then I read this awesome post about how <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">we&#39;re being manipulated</a> from all sides.</p>\n\n<p>This made me want to come up with the simplest win strategy for every retail investor, acting on their own, no matter what bullshit comes our way over the next week or more. Yes, we&#39;ve already figured out that this means to hold $GME. However, not everyone will not understand the method to our madness and chalk it up to the fact that we&#39;re just a bunch of degenerate gamblers. We need them to know why this time.</p>\n\n<p>Enter the $GME <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\">prisoner&#39;s dilemma game</a>. Here&#39;s the setup. The hedgies and banks can secretly coordinate a crash without being punished. If we cooperate on a short squeeze, it is publicly visible and can result in consequences for us. Still, last week proved the fact that humans, acting individually, have a bias to cooperate on a collective good (see wiki link at start of this paragraph for source). This is our ace in the hole.</p>\n\n<p>The only way they can win is when we betray each other (we won&#39;t) like prisoners being pressured by cops to rat on each other in separate interrogation rooms. The cops (hedgies and banks) will try everything to manipulate, scare, sow distrust, and incentivize the prisoners (retail investors) to rat on each other. The only way the prisoners get the best outcome is if they HOLD $GME 🚀.</p>\n\n<p>The Nash equilibrium for this game is for the prisoners to rat on each other. That&#39;s the mathematical equilibrium/outcome. However, I&#39;m arguing that we&#39;ve demonstrated our ability to surpass that. We&#39;re using our human bias to act individually (not cooperatively) for the collective good to overcome this math. We&#39;re maximizing the collective gain, not the individual gain. This is the whole point of a short squeeze that sticks it to the hedgies.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: HOLD</p>\n\n<p>Edit: A throw away account commented that this is sometimes called <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality\">superrationality</a> and then deleted their comment...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
