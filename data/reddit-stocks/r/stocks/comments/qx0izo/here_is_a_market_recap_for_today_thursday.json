  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 18, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. \n\nKey Numbers For Today \n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.34%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% \n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.9%\n* Amazon (AMZN): +4.14%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +8.25%\n* Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%\n* Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%\n\nAfter a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. \n\nEarlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. \n\nThe possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. \n\nAdding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. \n\nThe Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) fell after the company disappointed in their latest earnings report and slashed guidance for the full year, citing slowing consumption trends in China. Here are the numbers:\n   * **Revenue** $31.15 billion vs $32 billion expected\n   * **EPS**: $1.74 vs $1.93 expected. \n   * **Guidance Forecast:** 20-23% growth in fiscal 2022 revenue, down from 27% growth expected\n* Shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite stock, exploded higher after the company posted record revenues in gaming and data center sales and raised guidance moving forward. CEO Jensen Huang said, “Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations.\" Here are the numbers:\n   * **Revenue:** $7.1 billion versus $6.81 billion expected.\n   * **Earnings per share:** $1.17 versus $1.11 expected.\n   * **Gaming revenue:** $3.22 billion versus $3.18 billion expected.\n   * **Data Center revenue:** $2.94 billion versus $2.69 billion expected.\n   * **Forecast for Q4:** Revenue and EPS expected to grow 50% year-over-year, much higher than 38% growth expected\n* A bipartisan coalition of State Attorney Generals said it was launching an investigation into Instagram’s effects on children and Facebook’s role in promoting the service to young kids. \n* According to a report by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, Apple (AAPL) is working to speed up development of its electric car and is refocusing the project around full self-driving capabilities. According to the report, the company is pushing for a debut as early as 2025.
