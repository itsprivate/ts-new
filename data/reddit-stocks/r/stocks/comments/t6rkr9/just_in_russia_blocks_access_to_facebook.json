It has also shut down the few remaining Kremlin-critical outlets Dozhd (or TV Rain) and radio station Echo Moskvy.\n\nIn a statement, the State Department condemned what it called Russia’s “full assault on media freedom and the truth.”\n\nThroughout the conflict, Facebook has censored Russian disinformation through incremental steps that have included “fight\\[ing\\] the spread of misinformation and implementing more transparency and restrictions around state-controlled media outlets.”\n\nThe State Department has also slammed Russia over its censorship of social media websites, accusing it of “throttling Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram platforms that tens of millions of Russia’s citizens rely on to access independent information and opinions and to connect with each other and the outside world.”",
