I was told “no”, just wow…how greedy can you be?\n\nI made an account with Schwab and transferred my investments over. I then sold everything and bought VT. \n\nSchwab’s customer service is wonderful\n\n\nJust a reminder to not make the mistake I made! Luckily I only had about a year of that mistake, compared to 30.\n\n\nObviously you have to be cautious when listening to anyone online, but if you’re a young, long term investor…a low cost well known ETF really is hard to beat. Pick something like VTI or VT and call it a day.

As far as bonds etc.\n\nI’m only 33 so I have nothing to say about that, I’ll ask when I’m 50 years old when to look into bonds lol",
