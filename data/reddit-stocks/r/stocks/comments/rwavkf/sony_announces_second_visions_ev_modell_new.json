Vision-S has been developed on a  foundation of safety, adaptability and entertainment. Safety has been  our number 1 priority in creating a comfortable mobility experience.  That has not changed when building this SUV. A total of 40 sensors are  installed inside and outside of the vehicle to monitor safety.\n\n“In  terms of adaptability, we have connectivity that enables us to build a  vehicle that continuously evolves. It also makes it possible to  personalize the cabin for each user. With 5G, it enables high speed,  high capacity, and low latency connectivity between the in-vehicle  system and the cloud. The VIsion-S also evolves mobility as an  entertainment space,” said Yoshida. “The VIsion-S also evolves mobility  as an entertainment space, including gaming experience and audio. We  have learned more about mobility through our exploration of VIsion-S,  and through our partners who have supported this effort.”\n\nJust announced at CES.",
