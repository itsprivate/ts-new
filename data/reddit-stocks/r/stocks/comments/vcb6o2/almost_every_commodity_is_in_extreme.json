This is not much further off from rates we were seeing in late 2021. The average 10y breakeven for Q4 2021 was 2.53% vs 2.74% today. \n\n* **US Dollar Index**\n\nMost world currencies are tanking, resulting in strong US Dollar performance.

Could a more compartmentalized global economy change this?
