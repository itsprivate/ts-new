Calpers, as the pension fund is known, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n\n<p>Calpers, which has total assets of $445.6 billion, declined to comment on the stock trades.</p>\n\n<p>The pension bought 284,842 more American depositary receipts of the Chinese electric-vehicle maker, ending 2020 with 2.6 million ADRs. Calpers had been buying up NIO in the third quarter, as well.</p>\n\n<p>NIO ADRs rocketed more than 12 times in value last year, and so far in 2021 through Friday’s close, they were up 16.3%. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index, a broad measure of the market, rose 16.3% in 2020, and has gained 3.5% so far this year.</p>\n\n<p>NIO’s deliveries were strong in January, a bullish sign for investors, who seem to have an insatiable appetite for EV stocks. Nonetheless, NIO moved in January to raise capital through bonds.</p>\n\n<p>Calpers bought 1.8 million Activision shares in the fourth quarter, lifting its investment to 6.2 million shares of the videogame maker.</p>\n\n<p>Activision stock surged 56.3% in 2020 as the homebound stepped up their indoor gaming. So far this year, shares have gained 9.4%.</p>\n\n<p>Earnings last week topped expectations, sending Activision stock zooming. Activision said in December that its latest version of World of Warcraft is the fastest-selling PC game of all time. That announcement was on the heels of another upbeat assessment of the sales of another game.</p>\n\n<p>Walmart stock surged 21.3% in 2020, but so far this year it is nearly flat with a gain of 0.1%.</p>\n\n<p>At least one analyst thinks Walmart stock is due for another double-digit rise in 2021. The retail giant is continuing a digital push, even as its e-commerce chief retired at the end of January.</p>\n\n<p>Calpers bought 824,835 more Walmart shares in the fourth quarter, raising its holdings to 7.3 million shares.</p>\n\n<p>The pension bought 436,897 additional Target shares to raise its investment to 1.9 million shares.</p>\n\n<p>Target stock outdid Walmart’s in 2020, soaring 37.7%, and it has gained 7.0% so far this year.</p>\n\n<p>Target stock slipped in January after investors were disappointed that holiday sales weren’t stronger. The shares still have fans on Wall Street A Barron’s stock pick in the late summer, Target did quite well through the end of 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Barron&#39;s</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
