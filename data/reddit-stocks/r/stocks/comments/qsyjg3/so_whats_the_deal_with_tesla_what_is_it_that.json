However, after reading the works of Buffet, Howard Marks, Munger, and those gentlemen (which i consider my teachers), Tesla just seems to go against their philosophy; especially when it comes to the margin of safety principle.\n\nNow Tesla is a special case, if we look at Tesla as a company, their debt is consistently decreasing, equity and profits are growing like crazy, all of that is good. It's just the valuation. Currently at a P/E of \\~300 for instance, it means they have A LOT to back up for in the near future and the public obviously has high hopes in them.

How will this moat be protected by other automobile dealers? (i.e the Germans, Ford, the Chinese, etc...) Is it just their brand or do they have superior technology that will actually be hard to replicate/improve by other companies in the coming 10 years?\n\n\\- What other ventures are they going into besides cars?
