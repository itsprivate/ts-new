That’s about 10 times the value of the shares purchased on Tuesday, when Seattle-based Zillow pulled the plug on its tech-powered home-flipping operation.\n\nZillow’s stock has suffered as investors question its strategic goal of shifting from a company known for real estate listings to one that gets a bigger piece of the lucrative business around property transactions.\n\nArk’s daily trading updates provided figures for the portfolio changes without specifying buying and selling prices. They only show active decisions by the management team and don’t include creation or redemption activity caused by investor flows. For that reason, the firm’s exact trading activity may vary.\n\nFollowing their sales on Wednesday, Zillow makes up less than 1% of each of the ARK Innovation ETF, ARK Next Generation Internet ETF and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF. Tuesday’s update showed the flagship ARK Innovation ETF buying 288,813 shares.\n\nWood is well known for buying the dip in her high-conviction bets. She and her firm frequently emphasize they have at least a five-year investment horizon, and acknowledge that the disruptive companies they target are often volatile. \n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-ark-dumps-3-9-million-zillow-shares-1.1676719",
