This week will be a massive one for earnings, with tech mega-caps Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG), among many other very important companies, reporting earnings.\n\nLast Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed that the Fed is “on track: to begin slowing the pace of quantitative easing, signaling that the US economy has recovered enough to sustain reduced Fed stimulus starting as soon as next month. I have been saying for months that I expected tapering to begin either November or December or this year. He said, “I do think it’s time to taper, and I don’t think it’s time to raise rates.” This is music to my ears, I have also been saying for months that I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing the possibility of raising interest rates.\n\nIn the September meeting minutes, the Fed noted that “Participants generally assessed that, provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track, a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate. \n\nMarket participants are encouraged that despite persistent supply-side disruptions, which have only intensified as the holiday season kicks off, and labor market imbalances stemming from the pandemic. Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-November or mid-December.\"\n\nAs of Friday, about 23% of S&P 500 companies had reported actual results for the third quarter, and of these, 84% topped Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share (EPS), according to data from FactSet. The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 was 32.7%, based on actual results and expectations for companies still yet to report as of last week. If maintained through the end of Q3 earnings season, that would mark the third-highest earnings growth rate posted for the index since 2010. \n\n[https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-22-2021](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-22-2021)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) reported earnings and the stock is gapping up at the time of writing.
