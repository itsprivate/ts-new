If you look at consumer spending on FRED, it didn't just fully recovery from the 2020 shock, it's arguably on a stronger trajectory than it otherwise would be without the pandemic! At the same time, unemployment is still high and labor force participation is dreadfully low! The Fed created such a tremendous wealth effect, people are earning multiple years worth of stock market returns in the span of months. I'm not surprised many people are taking career breaks or retiring early. So why do we have red hot inflation? Because we're printing more money and making less things, it's that simple.\n\nThe inflation problem highlights how difficult it is to be a policymaker. On one hand, you don't want to under spend and risk seeing long-term economic scarring, but if you stimulate too much, you risk fueling inflation as well as asset price bubbles. The other factor at play is the politicization of economic policy. You're everyone's favorite politician when you're fueling spending, but it's hard to get reelected when you advocate for cutbacks. Prudent policymaking requires spending when times are bad, and building reserves when times are good - politicians have forgot about the latter half of that equation.",
