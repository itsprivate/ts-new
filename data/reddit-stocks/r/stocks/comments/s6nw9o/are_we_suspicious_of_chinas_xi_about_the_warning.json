Not because of what he said but just because it was said.  It maybe feels like some sense of global trade unity.  (forgetting about human rights stuff for the time being)   And with apparent transparency leaders can work together to keep markets stable.  Big plus for SPY.  The government will never let spy fail anyways because pensions are so heavily invested in it.  But after seeing that Chinese statement i feel like the markets dont have to worry about China for a while. \n\n   Or is it a threat??",
