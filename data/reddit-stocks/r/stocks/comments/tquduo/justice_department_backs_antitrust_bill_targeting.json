The bills’ opponents also say it is fair for e-marketplaces, search engines and app stores to profit off their creations’ popularity.\n\nThe department’s letter throws its weight behind a different view: that the platforms’ dominant position gives them unchecked power to influence the fate of other businesses, and that restricting the platforms’ conduct would carry significant benefits. \n\n“Discriminatory conduct by dominant platforms can sap the rewards from other innovators and entrepreneurs, reducing the incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation,” the letter says.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/justice-department-backs-antitrust-bill-targeting-apple-amazon-google-11648522635?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/justice-department-backs-antitrust-bill-targeting-apple-amazon-google-11648522635?mod=home-page)",
