I am aiming to give you food for thought if you are in disbelief about the current market situation. \n\nI started investing 5 years ago and have beaten the market by CAGR with a good margin ever since (20% vs SP500 14% something). Most of it I attribute to value investing. A school of investing that has consistently outperformed growth investing besides the past half decade. The basic idea is to invest in sound undervalued stocks with a margin of security to minimize risk and maximize upside in all market environments. \n\nI will not go intro details but if you want to read into it go for Benjamin Graham, Buffett, Lynch. A good start could be Modern Value Investing by Sven Carlin, a PhD Prof. in Amsterdam. \n\nToday's market situation is incredible to say the least. We have rising CPI, money printing, Infrastructure Bills, Defaults in China, Tapering, Fake money velocity being created with the intent of kicking the can down the road in hopes of not hitting it off a cliff soon because it will happen. On top of that a high and rising CAPE (Shiller) of almost 40! \n\nA high CAPE is correlated to low future stock market returns. A Shiller this high signals 0 to NEGATIVE avg SP500 returns. This could also go on for years so that we could see stagnation is the market for 5 - 10 - 15 years even. The point is not if this will happen, we have empirical data on this, but that is only a matter of time until it does. \n\nTSLA is maybe the mascot of this circus alongside Altcoins and the Crypto boom. If you made money until now, great for you. If you are thinking of jumping in now, understand that overpaying for equity is at least as bad as buying bad equity. Again, there is empirical data on the correlation of high valuation and low future equity returns. If you buy most equities right now without thorough anaysis and valuation you will guarantee yourself low returns in the future. \n\nI could go on and on about what dangers lie ahead and why now is the worse time to jump into trendy stocks. But let's talk now about how to hedge yourself from downturn in the coming years. \n\nHedging at its core deals with minimizing risk of total loss through different strategies. These strategies start from derivative plays to metals and global diversification. So let me present you some ways to limit your downside down the road. \n\n- Currency Hedging ( Gold Miners, Miner ETFs, Fixed rate Debt) \nUse this if you think the USD will lose power. Buffett's words \"gold is going long fear\". Fear is spreding and capital will slowly flow into this asset class. Gold goes up and you are protected. \n\n- Derivatives (buying SP500 Puts) \nA very simple straight to the point thing to do is buying puts on the US economy via LEAPS. The risk lies in the fact that you need to be right 2 times. Once on the direction of the market and once on the time frame. Longer LEAPS cost a lot so it depends on your liquidity if you can/want/should do this. \n\n- Diversify globally ( China, Europe, Russia) \nGet your hand on good, undervalued global stocks. Most other regions have lower CAPE than the US. Germany is looking good for this alongside China with the recent BABA drop. \n\n- Keep some cash \nCash can only be lost to theft and inflation. Keeping 15 - 20% in cash might not be that bad since a market crash would present amazing buying opportunities. \n\n\nA popular saying is \"value investing is dead\". I would argue for the fact that growth investing is dead for the moment. We are at the end of a huge debt cycle. This, just like valuation needs to return to the mean sooner or later. The next period will be favorable for value investing as the house of cards begins to crash down. You will be down a bit if you follow this strategy but you will secure your profits in the long run. This will help your compounding overall. When the crash comes, be prepared to find bargains and go all in. You will thank yourself later.",
