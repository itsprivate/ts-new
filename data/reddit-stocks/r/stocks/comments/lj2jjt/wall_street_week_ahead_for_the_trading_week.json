I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 15th, 2021.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html\">(Source)</a></strong></h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Walmart’s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government’s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank’s view on inflation.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects</h1>\n\n<p>Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>It has also increased concerns about inflation.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Inflation and rising yields</h1>\n\n<p>In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Housing statistics</h1>\n\n<p>Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes\nStocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><strong>This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/L9zmpOB.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/cZgpsNC.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Futures Markets as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/BvmjknF.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/AfQYO3V.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/GNiq0fE.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/v4lTpw4.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a></strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/83YL2qB.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Here are the upcoming IPO&#39;s for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0AZF7RF.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Friday&#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/MUQx3xY.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/60KQa22.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/LBj1NDa.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Presidents&#39; Day Seasonality</h1>\n\n<p>The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents&#39; Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington&#39;s birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents&#39; Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President&#39;s Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents&#39; week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week&#39;s end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;P 500 during Presidents&#39; Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Continues to be Weak</h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.</p>\n\n<p>Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox</h1>\n\n<p>“Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!</p>\n\n<p>Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>“The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.</p>\n\n<p>The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Short Interest Update</h1>\n\n<p>Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile&#39;s stock&#39;s median change in short interest from then to yesterday&#39;s release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000&#39;s most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard&#39;s (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.</p>\n\n<p>On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard&#39;s (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker&#39;s dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Agg-Industry.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png\">CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/QgDa3h7.png\">CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JRy8Aaj.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE TUESDAY&#39;S MARKET OPEN!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Monday 2.15.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())</h6>\n\n<p>NONE.
