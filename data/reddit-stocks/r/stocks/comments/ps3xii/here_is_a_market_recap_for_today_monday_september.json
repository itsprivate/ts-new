As has been the case for months, market participants are waiting for the Fed to signal when it might begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 1.66%, with the index falling more than 5% from its previous record highs for the first time all year, before somewhat pushing in the last hour of the session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.93%, while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.78%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed the most, closing the day 2.4% lower.\n\nGlobal markets were rattled today due to fears that Evergrande, the second-largest real estate developer in China with over $300 billion in liabilities, would default on its debt obligations and what the potential implications on the Chinese, and even, global economy may be. If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrande’s lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s said, it was unlikely that Evergrande’s default would cause a credit crisis “by itself” but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, “Banks’ exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for China’s financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time.” \n\nIn this way, Evergrande has been compared to Lehman Brothers, the  Since I am not a macroeconomist nor proficient in Chinese policy, I don’t feel comfortable drawing conclusions on the potential global implications of the default, though personally I do not yet see how contagion would spread globally like in 2008 given China’s financial sector remains comparatively insular, unlike the US. While comparisons are being drawn to Lehman Brothers, a US bank whose bankruptcy catalyzed the global 2008 recession (which largely did not affect China), I think those comparisons are not correct for a few reasons, though please note this is just my humble opinion.\n\n1. For starters, it is almost a certainty the CCP will aggressively intervene in the case of a default given Evergrande is designated as an entity of “systemic importance” in China and President Xi has proven to have no problem wielding a heavy hand when it’s forced. For example, In November 2008 the government introduced a 4 trillion Yuan stimulus package (roughly $620 billion or 14 % of 2008 GDP) for 2009 and 2010. Countless other examples exist. \n2. As I said above, the relationship between Chinese and US lenders is limited at best, unlike Lehman Brothers, which existed in the balance sheets of financial institutions worldwide. This means any damage caused within China has is likely to be contained within its own economy. \n3. Unlike Lehman Brothers, Evergrande still has tangible assets that will be sold off to help settle financial obligations. While their assets aren’t great and creditors know the company is in trouble, the sale of physical assets will help some. On the other, Lehman Brothers never had hard assets it could sell-off.\n\nIn other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Monday. As has been the theme for the past few months, market participants are looking for signals as to when the Fed may begin tapering the current pace of quantitative easing. As I have said before, I remain uncensored by QE tapering, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed starts discussing interest rate hikes\n\n**No highlights today, recap took longer to write today**\n\n**\"A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man perfected without trials.\" - Seneca**",
