What we DON&#39;T often hear, are people who loaded up in 2008. Regular average people. Those with small savings. Be it stocks or the housing market (which experienced a trailing small crash 2 years after). Those folks got literally everything on a massive discount.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it from that angle. If I have SOME money saved up now and it were 2008 again, I would be fkin ecstatic. Because after 4-5 years I would gain 1000% easily. And that&#39;s not even going into real estate.</p>\n\n<p>Also, recent example of last March will confirm my point. I made huge gains from it. I only bought Costco, Etsy and HomeDepot. No technical analysis. No charts. No graphs. Nothing. They were on sale and I assume people will be using them during the pandemic. Average intelligent move. There was no depth to it.</p>\n\n<p>And even if you don&#39;t maximize your portfolio, literally buying any stocks on the dip will make you money in the long run. You can be dense and still make money.</p>\n\n<p>So chill tf out. The dip IS AN OPPORTUNITY. It&#39;s a fking GIFT.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re all familiar with &quot;buy the dip&quot;. Well, here&#39;s the same principles with a minor tweak &quot;buy the (big) dip&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>There are 3 things for certain: death, tax and the stock market going up in the long run  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Based on some of the replies I have to clarify. I am by no mean saying &quot;THIS IS THE CRASH!&quot; or &quot;DON&#39;T INVEST. ONLY DO SO WHEN THERE&#39;S A CRASH!&quot;. I&#39;m merely saying how you should REACT TO/FEEL ABOUT these events. View them as opportunities rather than disasters. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
