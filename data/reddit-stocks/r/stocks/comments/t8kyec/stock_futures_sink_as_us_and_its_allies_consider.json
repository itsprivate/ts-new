Gold GC00, 1.88% surged 4.2% last week, its largest weekly gain since July 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Date.\n\nFighting in Ukraine continued unabated over the weekend, with humanitarian corridors intended to evacuate civilians from cities closed after coming under fire from Russian troops.
