Comments by colleagues since then have hardened expectations they’ll make that move, as officials extend a hawkish pivot to curb the hottest inflation since 1981.\n\nBullard repeated he favors an interest rate of about 3.5%, citing a version of the Taylor rule, a guideline developed by Stanford University’s John Taylor that uses inflation, the unemployment rate and an estimate of the neutral interest rate -- a rate neither contractionary nor expansionary -- to come up with his estimate.\n\n“You can’t do it all at once, but I think it behooves us to get to that level by the end of the year,” Bullard said.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee’s first goal should be getting to a neutral rate soon, Bullard said. The committee estimates that rate at about 2.4%.\n\n“We want to get to neutral expeditiously, I guess is the word of the day,” he said, repeating a word used by a number of colleagues. “I’ve even said we want to get above neutral as early as the third quarter and try to put further downward pressure on inflation at that point.”\n\nThe St. Louis Fed official said talk about recession was premature, with the Fed having only raised rates once at this point. He predicted that the U.S. economy would grow at a healthy rate in excess of its long-term trend both in 2022 and 2023, adding he expects unemployment to fall below 3%.\n\nMinutes of their March meeting showed many Fed officials favored raising rates by a half point and only opted for the more cautious 25 basis-point move because of the uncertainty around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe account showed officials expect to start shrinking their balance sheet by $95 billion a month, or more than $1 trillion a year, and could announce a decision in May. Governor Lael Brainard said April 12 that could mean roll-off as soon as June.",
