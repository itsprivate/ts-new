Some still seem overvalued, others now seem close to being cheap. Keep in mind Nasdaq has traditionally had a P/S ratio of around 3, and SPY is currently at 3 p/s (though will probably improve significantly in 2022 due to reopening/travel recovery). \n\n**Peloton** in particular is now at the same P/S ratio it had in March 2020 and yet has tripled its subscriber base over that duration (ie - juicy, recurring revenue). This is **before** all of the Q/E and money printing we had, as well as higher interest rates before March 2020.\n\nSame for **Roku** - it is now at March 2020 sales valuations, but over that duration it has grown it's revenue from $1.13b to $2.8b (taking in q4 revenues for 2021), a growth of 147% over 2 years, and doubled it's ARPU.\n\n**PINS** could have very strong upside as well when sentiment in the stock market improves. Just at a glance it's profit margins are really good and they are very close to achieving profitability. I think a lot of these social media stocks could be a bargain once they navigate through the Iphone Ad Apocalypse©️. \n\nI think **Zillow** could be worth taking a look as well. I mean yeah, the business fucked up, but Cathie Wood's selloff means it probably got oversold based on it's current financials and future prospects. The loss they took from their fuckup was not that big\n\nI am worried about **PLTR** as it still has 25x sales even after the selloff, and with the stock dilution there's a good chance big money might be waiting for further selloff before becoming interested in it again. It's a good company, but there's just so many better looking valuations in the market right now especially after the massive growth stock selloff. \n\nThoughts/opinions?",
