Not saying INTC is going to become a 2.5T megacap company like MSFT, but I'll lay it out.\n\nFor those who don't know MSFT was a stagnant stock for many, many years. If you bought MSFT at the peak in 1999, you would not have broken even until 2016. 17 years. But of course the stock broke through big time and is now the most(?) valuable company in the world.\n\nI see a sort of similar trajectory for Intel. Right now, Intel is the chip dinosaur. They have massive revenues, but limited growth. For context, Intel does $20B in revenue per quarter while Nvidia does $20B per year. Apples to oranges as Intel is stagnant while Nvidia is growing rapidly, but it's something to understand.\n\nIntel rested on their laurels, as they had the semiconductor market pretty locked down for a long time.  AMD was a joke of a company, and Nvidia was emerging as the leader in a technology that didn't exist until the last 20 years (GPUs). Intel could just chill, collect oodles of cash, pay their executives a ridiculous amount, and everyone was fat and happy. Until AMD actually started competing. It caught Intel flat footed, and it can be seen in the quality of Intel's products of late. AMD has actually been better than Intel in CPU, and competing with Nvidia in GPU.\n\nBut now, Intel is doing something about it and they have a unique advantage. Vertical integration. Intel does not only make the end product, they actually fabricate the semiconductors. In a chip shortage world with a big US government willing to doll out crazy sums of money, this is a huge deal. Intel is already investing tens of billions of dollars in new semiconductor fab plants, which will help address the largest supply chain issue in modern history.\n\nBeyond this, Intel has just released their desktop CPU chips which beat AMD across the board in performance. While desktop CPUs are a small portion of Intel's business, this shows progress. This along with their expansion plans in semiconductor fabrication, AND a new CEO that has major growth ambition for the company, I see this as one of the best investment opportunities in the market today.\n\nLast point, Intel is trading at a disgustingly cheap 9.8 P/E ratio. The market has not factored in Intel's impending growth, and this makes them a sleeping giant similar in spirit to Microsoft.",
