They have basically dominated the globe and the bull run that started after the 2008 crisis is due to their success. \n\nI don't think you can find a place on developed world where someone never heard of an iPhone, or an office that never used Excel, or an Adobe product, or doesn't have an Instagram, or doesn't check Amazon to buy something etc. There are many more examples. And no, this was not the norm before the last 10-15 years, not this much.\n\nLets look at the revenue growth of some huge *global* companies in Nasdaq index.\n\nAmazon: 2009 - 24 billion, 2022 - 469 billion\nApple: 2009 - 42 billion, 2022 - 365 billion\nGoogle: 2009 - 23 billion, 2022 - 257 billion\nMicrosoft: 2009 - 58 billion, 2022 - 168 billion\nMeta: 2009 - 0.7 billion, 2022 - 117 billion\n\nSo when a company increases their global revenue up to 10, 20, 30 times what do you think will happen to its stock? How is their huge global success all over the world is just because of Fed's QE? Are people in Europe using Instagram on their iPhone's they bought from Amazon because of the Fed?\n\nAmerican companies had an incredibly successful decade and the bull run is perfectly in line with this. And the Nasdaq PE is at 21 right now, not 100.",
