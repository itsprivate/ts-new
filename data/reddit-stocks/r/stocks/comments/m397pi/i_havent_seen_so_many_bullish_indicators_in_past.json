Japan , out of all indexes , hard to be bear when even that part of world working </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> QQQ</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>“ Rising rates are bad for tech “ bullshit , sure some idiotic things will be killed , sorry if you decided to go all in on car company valued at 1 mil per car sold ever , it’s probably overpriced but we don’t care, find support group where you tell each other in circles how it’s tech/energy/ self-driving company , for other people exhibit A:</p>\n\n<p>Last rate hike cycle and rates going up, fall 2015 to fall 2018, rates were up 40% on relative basis , QQQ was up 90%+, so tech will be fine but some priced to perfection and overhyped stocks will be killed, oh well , they all did insane 2020, don’t feel bad for them </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Absolutely insane amount of Fiscal support for masses\nIn 2008 we saved banks and let everyone get killed, in 2020 we send people UBI checks , didn’t let them get for closed on, expanded unemployment benefits and gave tax breaks for people with kids, it could never be more different then last recession and it’s hard to be a bear when Americans have the highest savings rate in the history of this country ever with trillions of $$$ of liquidity flying around the world looking what assets to get into </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In the early days of the Twentieth Century, when J.P. Morgan ruled Wall Street, a visitor came to the City. He was a long-time friend of Morgan, a commodity trader from Chicago. He was what might be called a “perma bear” following the Panic of 1907. No matter how high or low the stock market went, his outlook was pessimistic. Another crash, panic and depression were just around the corner.\nThis was his first visit to the world’s greatest city. He arrived at 23 Wall Street, and was ushered into J.P.’s spacious office overlooking the Exchange on one side and George Washington’s statue on the other.\nThey immediately began talking about the markets, Morgan being bullish as ever, and his commodity friend being as bearish as ever. “J.P.,” he said, “the news overseas doesn’t look too good.”\n“A buying opportunity!” responded Morgan.\nAfter an hour of friendly disputing about the markets, Morgan invited his guest to join him for lunch. They walked outside and started moving up toward Broadway. As they did so, his friend couldn’t help but admire the skyscrapers that dotted the Manhattan horizon. Morgan gave him a tour of the giant buildings, pointing out the Singer Building, the Woolworth Building across from City Hall, the famous three-sided Flatiron Building, and the recently completed Met Life Tower, rising 50 stories high, the tallest skyscraper in the world at the time.\nHis friend was duly impressed,. He said he had never seen anything like it, not even in Chicago.\nFinally, J.P. Morgan stopped his friend and said, “Funny thing about these skyscrapers – not a single one was built by a bear!”</p>\n\n<p>Positions :</p>\n\n<p>100% stocks since 2012, mix of VTI and VXUS , 2% BTC</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
