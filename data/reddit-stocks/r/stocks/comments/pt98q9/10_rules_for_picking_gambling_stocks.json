Know  your handle from your gross and net gaming revenue. Sportsbooks may  dazzle you with handle, but the bottom line figure of gross or net  gaming revenue is their traditional \"revenue\". Handle includes free bets  which don't lead to eventual EBITDA.  [See here Indiana's handle increased 11% but their gaming revenue decreased 5%](https://www.gambling.com/news/us/indiana-august-sports-betting-handle-up-11-posts-215-6m-2655900)\n2. Future  seasons and competitions of sports are baked into revenue projections.  We often see \"NFL season will be huge!\" or \"NBA games have been on the  edge\". All revised guidance takes into account seasons about to start or  even big competitions like the World Cup.\n3. Be  wary of the legalization landscape trap. We often hear \"wait til  California, Florida and Texas legalize\". Revenue is going to double.  First, this could be years off. Second, the revenue won't drip uniformly  to each provider with some state lotteries getting the bulk. If it was  that easy, DKNG would be at $100 already. We're bullish but this is a  long road.\n4. While operators such as PENN (Barstools), DKNG and Fanduel try to differentiate themselves, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DKNG/comments/peimu7/copy_paste/) proves that most sportbetting stocks move in unison (with selected over performers). Credit to [u/No\\_Ordinary\\_9661](https://www.reddit.com/u/No_Ordinary_9661/) for the post. Buy the sector not a stock. [Invest in BETZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p41n1y/betz_sports_betting_etf_a_closer_look/)\n5. Sportsbetting stocks are not a hedge against the market. Gambling stocks move up and down sometimes with - and sometimes - against the market. If  gambling legalization will be favorable, total-spend up and we see new  customers on the horizon, buy. If we see lack of legalization, bans and  gamblers turning to fantasy NFTs or another, sell.\n6. A  sports data provider such as SRAD/Sportradar makes it profits as a B2B  business but slowly these companies are becoming B2C since 22% of their  revenue is from gross gaming revenue of the sportsbooks (according to  filings). The more sportsbooks there are, the more fees and % they will  get. These companies trade at a premium in terms of EV/Revenue as they  have larger barriers to entry and often are profit-making already.\n7. AI  is a big deal in sportsbetting. The tech allows a company to increase  customer spending, restrict/block winning customers and offer customized  products per region. Look for companies investing heavily in AI.\n8. M&A  is trending in sportsbetting stocks (think DKNG/Golden  Nugget/Entain(!!), PENN/The Score) as the cost of customer acquisition  has soared and buying existing customers is the low hanging fruit.  Companies which can make M&A value-adds and acquire new gamblers are  going to make it.\n9. Don't  forget about sportsbetting stocks over in Europe. FLTR, Betsson,  Leovegas AB, Evolution AB and Entain are all legit companies with some  exciting stories.\n10. There  are hidden upsides to sportsbetting stocks. Could DKNG start to offer  stock bets and even take on HOOD? AI could reduce costs of doing  business by half. Vig isn't getting cheaper, so our EV/EBITDA ratios  decrease favorably.\n\nThat's all folks!",
