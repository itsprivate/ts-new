You are pretty (\\*\\*extremely\\*\\*) sure it’s going down.  Here is some information you might want to know before you take that bet.\n\nIn each 10-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher one day ten is 62%.\n\n**But… the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 88.82%. Let’s dig deeper.**\n\nChart: [https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO](https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO) (Source: Tradewell)\n\nThe chart above shows every single 10-day return period for the S&amp;P500 ETF, the $SPY, since its inception. \n\nThe blue lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY closed higher at least once. \n\nThe red lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY did \\*not\\* close higher at least once, ie. T\\[0\\] was the highest price the $SPY traded over the next 10 days. \n\nIf it’s not already obvious there are **a lot** bluer lines than there are red lines.  In each of the charts shown below the red lines will depict price paths that did not close higher at least once.\n\n# The same applies on a 15 and 20 day-timeframes:\n\n* \\-  In each 15-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 15 is 64% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 91.53%.\n* \\-  In each 20-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 20 is 65% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 93%.\n\nChart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT](https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT) (Source: Tradewell)\n\nAnd how about in a 60-day period. Historically, 97% of the time the SPY has closed higher at least once over the next 60 trading days.  \\*\\*Incredible\\*\\*.\n\nChart: [https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY](https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY) (Source: Tradewell)\n\n# So, what are the obvious and not-so obvious takeaways from this:\n\n1.  The S&amp;P500 has a natural upside drift on virtually every time frame the SPY has well over a 50% chance of closing higher than where it started.\n\n2.  The price path the SPY takes to its destination has a lot of new highs from the starting point.  In each of the 10, 15, 20 and 60 day timeframes the $SPY has historically had a probability of closing higher at least once 89%, 92%, 93%, and 97% of the time respectively.\n\nSee https://imgur.com/a/GviG5El",
