I just wanna have discussion on Roblox, where it&#39;s going, what happens and why the market could goof us retail guys again. I&#39;m no expert. Im not financial pro. I just sit at home all day reading about stocks and learning new stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Quick backstory, Roblox is dropping onto the market on March 10th via DPO. A DPO is a direct public offering. It&#39;s similar to an IPO, but in simple terms, it slams onto the market, for everyone at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the debacle with AirBNB and DoorDash? They were IPO&#39;s, scooped up by the hedgies and big boys. When retail wanted to buy, the price was stupid high and a lot of people got the rug pulled out from them. My understanding is the prices have settled now, but that day was a huge shitshow with retail buying power seriously hindered by the volume, demand, prices and platforms of retail brokers. </p>\n\n<p>Roblox will be ten times worse.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll make this next bit quick. (Edit - I lied, this next bit isn&#39;t quick but it is necessary). - </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Roblox?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Roblox is a MONEY PRINTER. Seriously. Maybe you&#39;re not into games, or have no kids or whatever. Basically, think of it as something like minecraft. Its a computer game for kids. The characters are made up of blocks, and run around online, meeting other players, doing little games, meeting each other, performing tasks etc. I don&#39;t really know, i&#39;ve never played it but watched some YT vids of people playing. In simple terms, it&#39;s good honest child friendly fun, which even adults can have a laugh with. </p>\n\n<p>It runs on Console, PC and mobile. Roblox has 1600 employees dedicated to removing hate speech and offensive things. There was a link to some far right groups using Roblox. As soon as they were found out by the press, Roblox banned them outright. My understanding is that as far as online gaming goes, it&#39;s very safe and good for kids, without much toxic language or offensive things that can upset young kids. It seems Roblox take their shit seriously in respect of this. </p>\n\n<p>~ Let&#39;s quickly talk numbers ~</p>\n\n<p>First off, let&#39;s drop the Tsar Bomba (aka the biggest mofo nuclear bomb ever made) of figures;</p>\n\n<p>From wiki - <em>From February 2020 to January 2021, Roblox experienced an increase in valuation from $4 billion to $29.5 billion, an increase attributed largely to the pandemic.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>29 MOTHERFUDGING BILLION IN 11 MONTHS.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Read that last line again before we continue. </p>\n\n<p>Next up, lets talk players. Again, wiki;</p>\n\n<p><strong>As of August 2020, Roblox has over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by over half of all children aged under 16 in the United States</strong></p>\n\n<p>164 MILLION.  Let me put that into perspective. I want you to imagine every single person in Argentina, Ghana, Saudia Arabia, Cuba, Sweden, Israel, Hong Kong, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Switzerland. That&#39;s how many people are active on RBLX each month. Mental. Now, obviously I could have just said 50% of the USA but that&#39;s boring.</p>\n\n<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, its not up to the heights of things like PUBG, Fortnite or Runescape, but it&#39;s 30% more popular than World of Warcraft and 50% more popular than GTA. \nOh, and RBLX is <em>free to play</em>. However, it generates its money from &quot;Robux&quot;. Basically, you can pay for these Robux as a form of currency, which you can then spend on special abilities in game. If I had $1 every time I read on Reddit, as user saying &quot;all my kid asks for at Christmas and birthdays is these damn Robux coin things&quot;, then i&#39;d have enough $$$ to take on SpaceX. It seems like kids just lap this shit up all the time, and parents seem fairly happy to pay for it because it&#39;s a fun game with no toxic assholes. It certainly has less of the agressive, competitive stigma and negative traits that has been attached to games like Fortnite. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, go and do you own DD on this. I&#39;m sure there are some negatives to be found, so go take a look.  All you really need to know is that RBLX is a motherfakin JUGGERNAUGHT of online gaming. In 2020 it had a revenue of <em>$2.2 billion</em> across all platforms. </p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Hey Electricpowow what is the point of all this crap about robollocks or something?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ok listen up and lets get to the point; this is my own sheer prediciton and that&#39;s it.... But, RBLX is going to be the MOTHER of all meme stonks. Seriously. It&#39;s a silly game with huge values and various other subreddits will find it hilarious to send Roblox to the moon. Mainly because of how simple it is. It&#39;s just got the whole aire of a meme stock about it. Even those that want to make it a meme stock believe deep down that it actually is a solid money maker at heart. The fact it&#39;s a silly kids video game makes it even sweeter. We know what the retail power is when it comes to video game related stock matters....</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, ignoring people who post rocket emojis and apes, this kinda stuff is gonna be loved by boomers. What do boomers have? Kids. What do kids talk about all day long? Roblox. These are the same boomers who invest in Apple because their 14 year old never shuts up about how amazing the next iPhone will be. They&#39;ll be doing the same with their small kids on the Blox. I&#39;ve even seen some redditors saying they&#39;ll be buying Roblox as a long term investement then gift it to their kids in 14 years time for their 18th, like it&#39;s some sort of damned Roblox based trust fund or some crazy shit. Can you imagine Cramer trying to explain League of Legends to his boomer audience? Well he doesn&#39;t need to explain Roblox because the boomer&#39;s kids talk about it all day. </p>\n\n<p>Now, the whole point of this is that.... EVERYONE is gonna want a slice of the Roblox pie. Even more so, that its coming out as an DPO. That means you and Papa Musk and horrible nasty Uncle Melvin will be able to buy RBLX at the same time. My understanding is they usually list at about midday. </p>\n\n<p>Now, why is Blox going to be a DPO and not an IPO? <strong>They actually wanted to list as an IPO several months ago</strong>. Wait, sorry that&#39;s not right. They wanted to list as an IPO <strong>TWICE</strong> and pulled out. Why? Well, one reason is that their accounting needed a closer examination, but the primary reason was because they saw the utter shitshow that was AirBNB. They saw AirBNB moon all the way past Jupiter and in no time at all, it nailed back down to earth with more power then a Michael Jordan slam dunk. </p>\n\n<p>In short, Roblox guys realised that IPO&#39;s are quite unstable with big companies, so they do DPO. I also think that a DPO somehow lets current investors safely leave their positions without getting burned or something, but im unsure on this. </p>\n\n<p>It also means that the DPO price will be much higher than an IPO starting price. This in turn brings some stability. My understanding is the expected IPO price was going to be about $5 per share, whereas the DPO price will be around $45/s. 45 Dollars a share is still pretty damn cheap. </p>\n\n<p>Now, consider that Andreessen Horowitz are one of their big investors. Ok, so who the hell is Andrew Hogwartz? That shit don&#39;t matter, all you need to know is that their track record of investment in young companies is as follows -</p>\n\n<p>Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Lyft, Occulus VR, GitHub, BuzzFeed and loads of others. Oh and they also dumped 800 million into Crypto in the last 5 years. What&#39;s the theme here? Tech based software stocks that balloon in value. That&#39;s what. I think its fair to say, that when it comes to tech and software, Andreas Hobofizz knows exactly what they are doing. And they&#39;ve dumped their money and reputation into the Blox. </p>\n\n<p>Now, with all this said what does this mean? It means everyone will want a slice of the RBLX cake. Boomers who&#39;s kids never shut up about it. People who like tech stocks. Gamers. Meme train riders. Investement funds and big hedgies. Everyone can see that RBLX is a money machine. And in fairness, $45/s is modest when you dive deep into the numbers. </p>\n\n<p>TakeTwo interactive (Grand Theft Auto) is $186/s. Activision is at $95/s. Tencent (who do Leage of Legends, another HUGE multiplayer online game) is at $88/s. Electronic arts, $137/s. </p>\n\n<p>Yadadayablah you get the idea. The only real big name I can find which is near the RBLX price is Nintendo at $78/s. (This is for another day but I think Nintendo is massively undervalued - Maybe thats why Cathy and her ARKK have been constantly buying it of late?)</p>\n\n<p>So, what is my whole point of this? If you got this far, good work, because i&#39;m a moron and my hands hurt from all this typing but I like you guys so ima carry on...</p>\n\n<p>Thing is, on March 10th. Every man and his dog is gonna want to throw some money at the Blox. And what happens when everyone wants to buy? Our shitty retail brokers... break. They have &#39;outages&#39;, they are slow, they don&#39;t process orders quickly etc etc. Maybe this is because of the huge volume and demand. Tin foil hat wearers will say it&#39;s all orcestrated, to freeze out retail while the hedgies get into the Blox at 45/s and we can&#39;t get in until 90/s, just like what happened with AirBNB and DoorDash. </p>\n\n<p>Note this, in all the reading i&#39;ve done so far about RBLX, I&#39;ve not seen a single article that is offering negative sentiment about it. I saw a fair amount of negative sentiment about the other two in the buildup, but especially DoorDash. </p>\n\n<p>So, obviously you can set your limits, but this won&#39;t work if the price is zooming around and the volume is being gobbled up. Oh yeah, volume. 199 million shares will be up for grabs. </p>\n\n<p>AirBNB put out 50 million. I think DD put out about 35 million. So... RBLX is putting out a lot of shares... But I also think it&#39;s gonna have much more interest than the companies I just mentioned...</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what the answer or solution is here if you do wanna buy it. I personally think (in the short term), it&#39;ll be bigger than a certain recent StopGame share in terms of interest. I honestly believe everyone will want some of this, and as retail investors, we&#39;re likely gonna get boned. <em>again</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Now this also extends to people who might not care about RBLX. If you shitty broker goes down, or lags, or won&#39;t connect because everyone wants some blox, then good luck selling that pennystock you&#39;ve been sat on for a while when March 10th is the perfect time to sell. It <em>might</em> have a knock on effect on your ability to perform other trades so please bear it in mind. You spot an amazing buy on American Airlines but unlucky bro, you cant because your shitty phone based broker has another &#39;outage&#39; because everyone wants to buy rublix or some shit. Maybe people could set up a couple of brokers to give them the best chance of a buy? Remember some brokers want proof of earnings and stuff so consider this sooner rather than later if you want in on this partay. </p>\n\n<p>Finally; Ever seen or heard someone online say <em>&quot;oof&quot;</em>? Its a Roblox meme that&#39;s been around for years. Its the noise a character makes when it gets hurt or falls over. Its another meme version of &#39;RIP&#39;.  I hope March 10th isnt a big <strong>oof</strong> for retail.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s it guys and girls. I&#39;d love to hear thoughts on this. At least give me the dignity of telling me my DD and entire post sucks. This will justify the 25 minutes I spent typing this out. </p>\n\n<p>My position? I&#39;m unsure at the moment. I&#39;m 50/50 between going total YOLO on Roblox on the 10th and either sitting out totally, or just trying to open a small position to see if I&#39;m right.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
