I warned that there was no way Fauci and the CDC would lift restrictions on these cruise companies but you people kept droning on and on about the vaccines.  Well here we are.  The restrictions will remain in place and the hopium high you were all on has just crashed.  All the summer cruises that Carnival booked will now have to be canceled.  They have a huge burn rate and that means trouble.  The only option moving forward for Carnival is either more offerings and crippling debt or bankruptcy restructuring.  And at this point I bet they would love to angle for a bankruptcy restructuring.  </p>\n\n<p>Go ahead. Vote this down like you did the other warnings.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
