Nuclear is also heralded as a solution to the issue a lot of renewables (solar and wind) have with providing a constant baseline of energy. However, this could also be solved by battery technology or hydrogen power not just nuclear. \n\nFor example:\n\n\\- [Ambitious EU emissions target needs nuclear](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Ambitious-EU-emissions-target-needs-nuclear-says) \\- September 2020 - World Nuclear News (Bias)\n\n\\- [Stepping stones: the slippery path to a clean energy future](https://theconversation.com/stepping-stones-the-slippery-path-to-a-clean-energy-future-3375) \\- September 2011 - Australian calls to replace coal.\n\n\\-[A UK Nuclear solution for Net Zero](https://innovateuk.blog.gov.uk/2020/11/24/a-uk-nuclear-solution-for-net-zero/) \\- November 2020 - GOV.UK \n\nSo as you can see there have been and still are calls for nuclear to supplement our path to net zero.\n\n**The Issue with Nuclear:**\n\n[The UN states we need to halve our global emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050](https://www.un.org/press/en/2020/sgsm20411.doc.htm). \n\nFrom now that leaves us with around 29 years achieve global net zero issues. Which to me doesn't seem long enough to implement nuclear with the current process of building nuclear plants.\n\nFor example:\n\n\\- In 2010 the UK announced 8 new nuclear plants to be built. In October 2020 Hinkley Point C is the only one of the eight sites to have begun construction with total cost of £22bn. [Hinkley Point C is due to open in mid-2026](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station). \n\n\\- The [site for Belarusian Astravets Nuclear Site was chosen in December 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astravets_Nuclear_Power_Plant), construction began in June 2012 and it was opened in June 2021.\n\n\\- Finnish Olkiluoto 3 [began construction in 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Unit_3), expected to begin operations in 2010. Currently still under construction after [facing another delay TODAY](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/finlands-olkiluoto-3-nuclear-reactor-faces-another-delay-2021-08-23/).\n\nSo for Hinkley Point C it will have taken 16 years to construct site from once it was announced as a site. Astravets took 13 years. Olkiluoto 3 is still being built after 16 years. There are many more examples of these lengthy construction and development times which are often increased due to lack of public support for projects and heavy government red tape surrounding nuclear power. \n\nIf we start constructing nuclear power plants TODAY it will take 5 years to be allowed to choose a site and another 10 to build the plant! Bringing us up to the year 2036 - and that's if we start choosing nuclear today.\n\nSome countries I believe will do this for example the UK government is very pro-nuclear. However, we still have major countries such as Germany and Italy. Germany shutting all nuclear plants by 2022 with no plans for more and replacing them with coal, Italy phased out all nuclear power in 2018 with no plans for more.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSo how will nuclear support us reaching net zero emissions when plants seem to take 15 years to plan and build and we have major economies ignoring nuclear? \n\n**A Solution? Small Modular Reactors:**\n\nSmall Modular Reactors are currently being developed by a number of companies such as Rolls Royce in the UK, Chinese ACP-100, US/Japanese Hitachi-GE BWRX-300 for some names.\n\nAdvantages ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small\\_modular\\_reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_modular_reactor#Waste)):\n\n\\- Much smaller - Rolls Royce's SMR takes up 40,000m2 which is 10% of that needed for a traditional plant. I think this could sway public opinion as well as current nuclear plants are huge eye-sores.\n\n\\- Licensing - Once the first unit is designed and approved, licensing subsequent units should be much simpler as all units operate the same. This will reduce roll-out times drastically.\n\n\\- Scalability - One site can begin with one module, however modular design will allow more SMRs to be added to any individual site to increase capacity.\n\n\\- Reduced waste - Most SMRs are fast reactors with higher fuel burn up reducing the amount of waste.\n\n\\- Economies of scale/manufacturing - SMRs aim to be standardised to allow for mass production due to their smaller size. This will allow for mass-rollouts and cheaper costs. \n\nObviously, most of these projects are also in design stages and will require approval and then constructions which I don't believe will be quick. However, I do believe in the ability of these SMRs to be rolled out relatively quickly once approved. \n\n**Further Reading and Sources:**\n\n\\- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small\\_modular\\_reactor#Waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_modular_reactor#Waste)\n\n\\- [https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/small-modular-reactors.aspx#/](https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/small-modular-reactors.aspx#/)\n\n\\- [https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable)\n\n\\- [https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-nuclear-power-must-be-part-of-the-energy-solution-environmentalists-climate](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-nuclear-power-must-be-part-of-the-energy-solution-environmentalists-climate)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on nuclear?",
