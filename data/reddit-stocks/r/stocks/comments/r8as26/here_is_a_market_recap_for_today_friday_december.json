  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 3, 2021**\n\nStocks sank today to end the week lower, with technology and growth stocks cratering as market participants digested further updates regarding the Omicron variant and recent marks made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, alongside the Labor Department’s November jobs report. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the week -1.2% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slid -2.6% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell -1.83%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week a whopping -5.24% lower. \n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.87%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.74%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.11%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.05%\n* VIX: +8.71%\n* NVIDIA: -4.46%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -6.42%\n* DocuSign (DOCU): -42.22%\n* Asana (ASAN): -26.40%\n* Marvell Tech (MRVL): +17.70%\n\nDevelopment surrounding the new Omicron variant remains front and center of the market’s attention. So far, at least five US states have reported at least one case of the variant and over three dozen countries globally. A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far seen “a suggestion that there is increased transmissibility” of the Omicron variant. However, the report notes that it is still too soon and not enough data is available to make any conclusions yet. \n\nVaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. \n\nHe said, “There is no world, I think, where \\[the effectiveness\\] is the same level we had with \\[the\\] Delta \\[variant\\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)\n\nMoreover, the market move today coincides with the release of the Labor Department’s November job report, which showed a disappointing hiring rate even as the unemployment rate fell to a fresh pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers\n\n* Payroll Gains: +210,000 vs +550,000 expected\n* Unemployment Rate: 4.2% vs 4.6% in October\n\nJim Smiegiel, Chief Investment Officer at SEI Investments, said “The markets ... have been pricing in, really, a worst-case scenario. I think the market is now switching gears a little bit and perhaps lessening the intensity of the potential for negative outcomes. The big issue still remains more about the world government's reaction to the variant and what that means from a lockdown perspective. And that's what the market is still kind of struggling with at this stage.\" \n\nJ. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. \n\nPowell said, ““We tend to use \\[the word transitory\\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”\n\nMoreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. \n\nCharlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond-buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory.\" \n\nOn a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying (no more than ¼ position). As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) cratered more than 40% after posting disappointing earnings and lowering guidance. Like Zoom (ZM), Teladoc (TDOC), and Peloton (PTON) before, this is the latest COVID stock to crater in value. \n* Shares of Chinese ride-hailing company DIDI gapped down once again after announcing plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange amid regulatory pressures from the Chinese government. This is one of the most spectacular IPO failures I have ever seen and probably just the beginning. I’m glad I divested all my shares in Chinese companies, I wouldn’t trust a single dollar of mine in that environment. At this point, I’m expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. \n* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you aren’t really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company\n* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. \n* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. \n* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. \n* Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. \n* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  \n* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go. QCOM said it partnered with hardware company Razer to create an initial test device for gamers.\n\n“The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.” *-Nelson Mandela*",
