So I really hope to start seeing some DD posts about new companies or existing ones with potentially bright futures. </p>\n\n<p>I was in amc at 2.41 a week before they took off fully having researched and believing theatres will make a comeback and that that share price was an absolute steal. I was rewarded for this but only by luck, not by AMC themselves. Luckily I’m able to distinguish that and not consider this pure luck as me being some expert investor in my first week of investing</p>\n\n<p>Right now I’m in sundial. It’s a penny, high risk high reward stock. The ceo is making headway toward profitability and that’s really all we can ask for, a ceo who is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed= good odds of success in my eyes. All anyone can do is try, sundial is up today in a good way. Hoping to see more good results tomorrow</p>\n\n<p>Just saying though, like the people constantly bombarding with GME posts are seeing a lot of fucking new income, getting high off it and are now just as fucking greedy as wallstreet folks.. like lol. It was never about taking on the big guys. If it was, it was only like the first few days of it now it’s just greedy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
