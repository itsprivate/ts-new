The decline has only been slightly eased by the broad rally across global markets in recent days, which ended a seven-week losing streak for Wall Street stocks.\n\n&gt; Nearly $36bn has flowed out of emerging market mutual and exchange traded bond funds since the start of the year, according to data from EPFR; equity market flows have also gone into reverse since the start of this month.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\n- Pandemic lockdowns (e.g., China)\n- Rising interest rates in the US and other rich countries devalue the debt of cheap countries leading to bond sell-offs.\n- Many countries heavily rely on Russian oil (e.g., Hungary).\n- General geopolitical uncertainty with Russia and China\n- The USD is appreciating to historically high levels (to 2002 levels)\n- Lower expectations of global growth cutting into emerging market equities\n\n\nYou can gain exposure to emerging countries with a general ex-US fund like VXUS, which holds 25% in emerging economies. You could overweight emerging directly or beyond this level, but the large negative skew in returns in emerging economies makes this a bit risky ([negative skew looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/YdOwpTJ.png), occurring when there are extreme outcomes to the downside relative to the center). Emerging economies are more likely to undergo total collapse than richer ones. \n\nFor those of you who are super-bearish and listen to Jeremy Grantham (I usually do not), he actually expects negative returns everywhere except in emerging markets, and in particular recommends emerging market value. [Here are his 7 year forecasts.](https://i.imgur.com/qXuOf3M.png) (Personally, I think his US predictions are a bit absurd) You can directly invest in emerging market value through the Avantis fund AVES, and they offer AVEM for general emerging markets.\n\nEmerging and ex-US countries have larger concentration in industrials, commodities, energy, etc. If you don't like the tech-heaviness of the American market in general, this is another reason to diversify internationally. Years like 2022 show how important energy can be to a portfolio, for instance.\n\nYou can also pick individual stocks, so please feel free to recommend your favorite emerging market stocks--this is /r/stocks, after all.",
