Initial Asia supply chain builds for iPhone 13 are in the 100-million-unit range compared to the firm&#39;s initial iPhone 12 reads of 80 million, he added.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;While this number will clearly move around over the coming months, we believe this speaks to an increased confidence with Cook &amp; Co. that this 5G driven product cycle will extend well into 2022 and should also benefit from a post-vaccine consumer &quot;reopening environment,&quot; Ives wrote in the note.</p>\n\n<p>The iPhone 13 will likely have a 1 terabyte storage option, double that of the current highest Pro storage capacity, the analyst said. It will also include a number of enhancements, with Lidar across all iPhone 13 models.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the iPhone 13 could be a &quot;game changer&quot; indicating the supercycle party in Cupertino is going well in 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AAPL Price Action:</strong> At last check, Apple shares were rising 5.22% to $127.59.</p>\n\n<h3>Latest Ratings for AAPL</h3>\n\n<p><strong>DateFirmActionFromTo</strong></p>\n\n<p>Feb 2021RBC Capital Assumes Outperform</p>\n\n<p>Jan 2021DA Davidson Maintains Buy</p>\n\n<p>Jan 2021 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/03/19914271/why-apples-iphone-13-could-be-a-game-changer-with-1tb-storage-option-lidar\">https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/03/19914271/why-apples-iphone-13-could-be-a-game-changer-with-1tb-storage-option-lidar</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/users/shanthi-rexaline\">Shanthi Rexaline</a> , Benzinga Staff Writer</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
