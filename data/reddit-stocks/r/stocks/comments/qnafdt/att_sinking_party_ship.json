But i work for company A, who sells me to Company B, who then sells me to AT&T. ATT pays like $80 for me, and i get FAR less. All those middlemen packing their accounts with money. Its a full blown circle jerk up top while the ship sinks beneath them. The shear fact thats its a utility company and that it is so HUGE is the only reason this dinosaur is not dead...yet. Just look at that DIV, desperation!! Anyways, buy puts or whatever else your vultures want, keep circling. I wonder who will buy us?",
