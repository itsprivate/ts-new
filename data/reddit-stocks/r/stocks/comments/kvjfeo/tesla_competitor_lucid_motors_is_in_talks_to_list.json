Lucid, which is backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, is working with financial advisers, the people added. The talks are ongoing but could still fall apart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Several electric vehicle makers have done deals with [reverse merger companies] as startups seek to bulk up and raise cash to compete with industry leader Tesla Inc. Lucid would be one of the most established electric vehicle companies to take this route.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lucid targets the luxury end of the market and its chief executive officer, Peter Rawlinson, was previously Tesla’s chief engineer on the Model S sedan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
