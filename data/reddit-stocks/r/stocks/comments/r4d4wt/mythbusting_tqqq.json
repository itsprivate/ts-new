  "selftext": "It seems many posters are circulating a lot of misinformation about TQQQ (and leveraged ETFs in general) so I'm certain a lot of readers have internalized many false myths that I want to bust:\n\n**TQQQ will always decay over time vs 3x QQQ**\n\nFALSE\n\nBasically TQQQ rebalances daily after the close.  The purpose of the rebalancing is to ensure TQQQ will perform at 3x the next day so it will reduce or increase it's exposure appropriately.  This rebalancing means TQQQ will have a variance to 3x QQQ over time.  If bullish, TQQQ will be >3x, bearish <3x which are both positive developments for investors.  The problem is choppy markets will cause TQQQ to decline in value vs. QQQ which is what a lot of myths focus on.\n\nBloggers have coined this \"volatility decay\" and this is a bad misnomer.  Decay implies the rebalancing is always bad as in negative to the returns on TQQQ.  For example:\n\nOn February 19, 2020 the pre-pandemic closing high for QQQ is $236.98, for TQQQ is $118.06 (pre-2021 split).  On March 23, 2020, QQQ closed at $170.46, a drop of 28.1%.  A 3x drop would be 84.2% and many bloggers would have you believe the drop would be even worse with volatility decay --  WRONG.  On March 23, 2020, TQQQ closed at $35.62, a drop of 69.8% which while significant is still way less than 3x and a *positive* variance of 14.4%\n\nNow, let's take it from there to the close on September 1, 2020.  QQQ is at $299.92, a 75.9% gain.  3x would be 227.8% but TQQQ closed at $169.74 a 376.5% increase and a huge *positive* variance of 148.7% to 3x QQQ.  Thus, the rebalancing or \"volatility decay\" can be positive or negative.\n\n**TQQQ will go to zero one day**\n\nFALSE\n\nThe only way to have TQQQ drop to zero is if the NASDAQ 100 drops 33.4%+ in *one* trading session.  Remember, it has to be *one* trading session.  Just think about that, what would it take for the index to drop that much in a single day?  Probably something that makes money worthless like a nuclear war or huge asteroid strike.  And then we have circuit breakers on the exchanges.  Not going into detail but a drop of 20% should shut down trading for the day and TQQQ will rebalance.  Even if this kept on and on the bottom line is TQQQ will continue to exist.  Want more evidence?  SQQQ is still alive and kicking despite the massive bull market and many reverse stock splits.\n\nAlso bloggers have cited many leveraged ECN's and commodity ETFs closing and citing contango as a built in negative factor.  There are so many problems with this.  TQQQ is based off stock index and while contango is a real thing it is inapplicable to TQQQ.\n\n**My Opinion**\n\nFor me TQQQ has been great for swing trading and writing options on.  But I watch it daily, use technical analysis, and have been lucky to sniff out major drops before the bottom and sell, and then get back in.  Yes, I got murdered on the way down but I recovered it all and then some.  Buy and hold (and the implied *forget*) is IMHO too dangerous no matter what backtesting tells you.\n\nThat is the big question; will you have the discipline to sell out when the next big correction hits?  And also will you buy back in before it completely bounces back?  If you don't think you can do both then I would stay away from TQQQ.",
