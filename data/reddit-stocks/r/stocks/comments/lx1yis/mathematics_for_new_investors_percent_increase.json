I.e., if you’re talking about a stock that goes up 1% one day and then down 1% the next day, you’ve actually only lost 0.01% of value. However, in the example above at 50% volatility, you’ve lost 25% of the value ($100 stock goes to $150 then down to $75). At the extreme at 99% up then 99% down, you’re stock is now worth $1.99.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a graph I made to show what the curve looks like at different % change levels: (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/dyb1npq\">https://imgur.com/gallery/dyb1npq</a>)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
