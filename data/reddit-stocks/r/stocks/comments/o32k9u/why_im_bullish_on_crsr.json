Also, I&#39;m not saying we pump this stock this is just my DD so mods please don&#39;t remove my post again I put in a decent bit of effort lol and this isn&#39;t another shit post. </p>\n\n<p>First, CRSR is trading at a P/E of just 20 which is extremely low compared to the previous growth it&#39;s had. Of course, CRSR can&#39;t sustain their growth from last year but they will continue to grow nonetheless. Their competitors such as Logitech are trading at slightly higher P/E&#39;s yet are 7x the size of them indicating once again how low their P/E is for their sector.</p>\n\n<p>Then, their free cash flow is very strong. With most companies I would like to see them trading at around a 20x free cash flow or 25x if their growth is strong. For a company like Corsair 20x seems low and 25x would seem reasonable yet they are trading at just 16x FREE CASH FLOW. N</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention they are trading at a P/S of less than 2 and I understand that they have low margins but this is still very good for a relatively small company. Additionally, with Corsairs strong cash on hand this provides them with the opportunity to possibly improve their management or put more money into paid promotions with youtube/twitch streamers which I believe is much needed.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, when I used my DCF model assuming 11% growth for the next 3 years, then 9 percent growth for the next 3 after that, and lastly 8 percent growth for the next 3 years then CRSR has a margin of safety 28% and an intrinsic share value of 41. Also remember, I am assuming somewhat conservative growth numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, one of the main arguments against CRSR is that they cannot maintain their growth from last year and they will in fact shrink but this was proven completely wrong in q1 of 2021 where they continued to grow.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
