With the earnings call out of the way and a good entry point at hand,  I&#39;d like to discuss my outline of the business and my short-term price targets. After that, I will discuss how I am approaching this trade, namely through cheaply priced long-term call options </p>\n\n<p><strong>Core Outline of the Business Model:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I presume most people are familiar with CVS in some capacity but you may not be aware of the whole of their current business model. As you might imagine, a large part of CVS is its pharmacy sector. CVS sells and manages prescription and OTC drugs, receiving most of its revenues as reimbursement from insurance. CVS also provides a number of pharmacy services (vaccinations, minor check ups, etc.) This has been a growing part of their business as I&#39;ll discuss later. You also probably know that CVS has a large retail sector. They sell candy, household goods, etc. Not very exciting. </p>\n\n<p>However, if you have not been following this company, you are probably unaware that since 2018 CVS has also owned Aetna, an insurance provider, and Caremark, a PBM (pharmacy benefit manager). Aetna obviously collects premium and partially or fully covers the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs for its clients. Caremark, as PBM, negotiates with drug manufacturers on behalf of clients and takes a cut of the money that it saves consumers. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll discuss the potential developments in each these sectors but first I&#39;d like to state my central thesis:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Target, Fair Value Estimate, and Spreadsheets Galore</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Central Thesis:</strong> CVS is deeply undervalued at $70-75 dollars a share (EV/EBITDA ~9) given its consistent, if moderate, revenue and earnings growth. This cheap pricing  likely reflects market fears over 1. CVS&#39; debt and 2. Competition with Amazon. I believe that these fears are unsubstantiated and should be dispelled as CVS begins to pay off its debt with its strong cash flow and fully integrates its newly acquired insurance sector and its growing service business. The market should accordingly award CVS a higher earnings multiple and this in-addition to growing earnings should provide investors with an above market return. This investment also provides a good opportunity for considerable leverage considering the cheap pricing of long term options contracts. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>2 Year Price Target: $100</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Long Term Fair Value: $130-140</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>I will try to keep the rest of this post mostly to text. However, since I am providing a concrete price target and fair value estimate, I should provide concrete numbers to back them. </p>\n\n<p>The  full forecasting I used for my 2 year price target can be found here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnS5nVvVcAfRu4TrPwXL7IFEMXP9OLTJI5HRe5EuBV8/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnS5nVvVcAfRu4TrPwXL7IFEMXP9OLTJI5HRe5EuBV8/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>The fair value estimate comes from <a href=\"/u/EnduredMarkets\">u/EnduredMarkets</a>: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPR0TqRXZOYqM81nUfuUGIRsot9kfDIif93L7H3y1YQ/edit#gid=1734015007\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPR0TqRXZOYqM81nUfuUGIRsot9kfDIif93L7H3y1YQ/edit#gid=1734015007</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is CVS so cheap?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll notice looking at the CVS chart that CVS has traded in the $70 range for a long time putting it at a very cheap (9-10x EV/EBITDA) despite its strong earnings and revenue growth. In fact it was down almost 5% today on a earnings report with almost no surprises. What is the market concerned about? </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Debt: CVS acquired ALOT of debt in 2018 when it acquired Aetna. As a result of this, CVS has had a rather concerning Debt/EBITDA above 5 for the past 2 years. However, I believe these concerns are overblown. Debt is obviously a detriment to a business because its represents future earnings that will not be paid to share holders. However, debt is only really a concern when it puts a company at risk of default. This is not a concern with CVS. CVS&#39;s free cash flow from operations has allowed them to consistently service their capex, debt, and share holder obligations with almost a third of this cashflow left over. CVS, in fact, could have been more aggressive about paying down this debt for the past couple years but chose not to. This is likely because the cost of servicing these debts was so low (interest rates) and because they saw opportunities to expand their buisness. CVS (both in their own earnings reports and by analyst estimates) is expected to pay down this debt over the next two years and should reach a much healthier 3x debt/EBITDA by the end of 2022</li>\n<li>Amazon: Amazon has recently introduced Amazon Pharmacy, a mail service for prescription drugs. Obviously as soon as Amazon gets into your industry you should just close up shop right? Not necessarily. Amazon has not been particularly aggressive in expanding their pharmacy business. As far as I can tell, they have not pursued aggressive pricing schemes like in other industries they&#39;ve attempted to disrupt. In my view, Amazon Pharmacy is intended to act as an added incentive from Prime members rather than an industry disruptor. However, even if they should become aggressive, CVS has two key advantages.  First, CVS has great synergistic benefits from their insurance and PBM buisnesses which they can use to keep customers in the CVS ecosystem and offer attractive pricing. Second, healthcare is an area where consumers are likely to stick to known trusted brand names. Amazon is well positioned to disrupt &quot;low stakes&quot; businesses (groceries, consumer goods, etc.) where you can &quot;just give it a try.&quot; You may not be as likely to switch to them from known healthcare provider which has records of your regular prescriptions/healthcare info and may be entrusted to deliver critical, lifesaving medication. I believe that this will become apparent to markets over the next couple of years as CVS continues to grow revenue and earnings in a post-covid world. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If we, as investors, do not believe that these factors are of concern, then we can assume that CVS&#39;s earnings will continue to grow as they have over the past couple years (mid single digit per year) and that the market will award CVS a higher earnings multiple as it does so<strong>. My 2 year price target of $100/share assumes that this scenario plays out (i.e. CVS maintains it status quo).</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Added Business Drivers</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I just stated, I attempted to have a conservative outlook in my price projection. However, there are two key additional developments in CVS&#39; business which may propel earnings and price further than expected in this estimate. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Aetna-Caremark-CVS synergy: For a traditional pharmacy, there are a lot of negotiators to work with. Customer, PBM, Drug manufacturer, insurance provide, and pharmacy all have to agree to certain terms which fit their best interest. With Aetna and Caremark under its wings, CVS controls all parts of this system except of the customer and drug manufacturer. This provides a number of synergistic benefits that can be used to drive revenues and improve margins. For example:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>a. Aetna may offer consumers lower co-pays to get their prescriptions at CVS pharmacies</p>\n\n<p>b. Aetna and CVS pharmacy can merge their collected customer data to recommend preventative treatment which will lower customer and insurance expenses by avoiding costly procedures as a result of a health crisis</p>\n\n<p>c. Caremark may use the added leverage of its association with CVS pharmacy and its gains in customer base (due to the advantage its able to provide due to these other synergistic effects) to negotiate better drug pricing from manufacturers (thereby increasing their profits and reducing customer costs.)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Health Hubs: CVS has, for a while now, had &quot;minute clinics&quot;  in CVS stores where customers can receive shots and basic health assessments. However, CVS has recently introduced &quot;health hubs&quot; which offer a much wider range of services. In essence, these health hubs can provide almost all of the healthcare services provided by a primary care doctor at a much lower cost. These health hubs have not been fully rolled out yet and are only being tested in a few cities. However, they are expected to become increasingly prevalent if they are successful. Not only do these health hubs provide an additional source of revenue to CVS, they can be a good way of introducing customers to CVS&#39; system. Using a &quot;health hub&quot; provides CVS with the opportunity to recommend that a customer switch to Aetna as an insurance provider by offering them low or zero co-pay at the health hub. Aetna can then incentivize them to use CVS as a pharmacy. Caremark gains the negotiating power of another customer. A fully integrated, healthcare ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not an expert in this industry. I have no idea if these additional factors will play out. However, if they do, they will likely bolster earnings and CVS&#39; share price</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cheap Options Pricing</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re only interested in holding shares, you can stop reading here. This is a great play as a shareholder looking for above market returns and you can earn a good dividend along the way. </p>\n\n<p>I, however, am adding leverage to this play with long dated, ITM, call options (LEAPS). Because of CVS&#39;s low volatility, options pricing is incredibly cheap. Buying, ITM options for Jan 2023 will allow you to at least breakeven, even if CVS only returns 8% over the next 2 years. If CVS hits my price target, this play will provide ~100% return. If the extreme bull-case plays out, ~200-300% return. Obviously, the use of options introduces considerable risk. If you&#39;re wrong and hold to expiration, you will lose all your investment. However, I believe that CVS is priced so cheaply it is unlikely to trade much lower and I see good potential for it to reach my current price target. If you access the &quot;what contract should I buy&quot; and &quot;ROI Calculator&quot; tab of my spreadsheet above, you can see how these return scenarios play out given different prices at expiration. <strong>Note that the option prices listed here do not automatically update. You will need to update them with real-time quotes.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Explore and decide what is best for you. Personally, I am holding Jan 2023 $65 calls. </p>\n\n<p>I am not a professional investor and I mostly learn by researching company&#39;s  making a predictions and testing them by investing. I would appreciate any criticisms, added knowledge, or other ideas you&#39;re willing to provide. We all learn together</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/EnduredMarkets\">u/EnduredMarkets</a> for the fair value estimate. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Bo3andlol/\">u/Bo3andlol</a> whose spreadsheets I used to automate the &quot;Financial Overview&quot; tab of my spreadsheet.
