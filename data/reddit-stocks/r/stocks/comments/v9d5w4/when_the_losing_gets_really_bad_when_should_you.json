I also understand that unless you sell, you haven't really lost any money because you never know... economy could rebound and certain stocks come make a comeback... HAVING SAID THAT... I highly doubt these will ever come back to the price I bought them...\nSoooooo, what's the best plan? Load up to lower average price and then sell at a lower loss? Or just wait out and hope it goes back up to a certain level and cut them loose?\nI am a \"long term investor\" if you will, so I can handle the wait if needed\nEither way it will be a loss and I might have to live with that... I just want to soften the loss if possible\nAny comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated...thanks\n\nEDIT 1.... the companies are GMBL, FUBO and VIOT\n\nGMBL was an impulse buy for sure and I might have to live with that loss... I highly doubt I would recoup even 50% of what I put in\n\nFUBO I felt was a good investment since they are in the live sports/streaming service but the industry is just been getting hammered for a while.. I thought they had a solid business but I am not sure anymore and I am willing to give it some time to make sure\n\nVIOT is a Chinese Internet of Things company which means this could have been a great play if not because all the Chinese companies are just getting dragged down by the government but thats another discussion.. I just don't know if this might get better down the road and I could be patient if necessary but just wanna make sure I do it for the right reasons...\n\nEDIT 2  ....I just realized the original post might have been confusing in the sense that these are NOT the only three stocks I own...they are just my worst performers (apologies for the confusion) \n\nEDIT 3 .... I just started investing last year on my own so I don't have shares in the triple digits on any of my stocks and since I am new to the investing world I don't dabble in the options, calls, puts that most people here are more experienced at...just regular investing (buying shares and holding them) \n\nThanks again for all the advice so far 🙏",
