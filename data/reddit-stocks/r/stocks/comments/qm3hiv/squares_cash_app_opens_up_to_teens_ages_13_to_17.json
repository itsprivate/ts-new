Previously, the app required users to be at least 18 years old, like rival Venmo. The company says younger teens will need to get a parent or guardian to authorize their account, but can then begin to send peer-to-peer payments and take delivery of a customized Cash Card, powered by Visa.\n\nIn addition, teens will be able to send and receive peer-to-peer payments with family and friends, or anyone else on Cash App’s network of over 40 million monthly active users.  Other features also mirror the existing version of Cash App, including access to spending rewards at top retailers, ATM access with a $2 fee, and support for paycheck direct deposit.\n\nThis is a good news for square as more people can use cash app. As it competing with venmo, this first move will provide square the opportunity to increase the users loyalty to cash app. Square is still growing revenue at a fast pace and the best fintech stock to own for the next decade.",
