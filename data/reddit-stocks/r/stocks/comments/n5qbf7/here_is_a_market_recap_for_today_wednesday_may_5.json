Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. </p>\n\n<p>The sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn&#39;t overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them.&quot; In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”</p>\n\n<p>With the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, “I do think there&#39;s a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it’s going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it’s consumer confidence, whether it’s the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.”</p>\n\n<p>The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing</li>\n<li>Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a “mistake”. He said, “Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”</li>\n<li>Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about its plans to expand to the European markets.</li>\n<li>Virgin Galactic (SPCE) shares drop after Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos space company, announced plans for first New Shepard suborbital flight in July of this year. Virgin Galactic plans to reopen ticket sales after the founder makes his own first flight, now slated for the summer after several delays.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Commerce Department is pressing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and other Taiwanese firms to prioritise the needs of U.S. automakers to ease chip shortages in the near term, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.</li>\n<li>Factory orders rose 1.1% in March over February after a 0.5% drop the month prior, according to the Department of Commerce. This was still slightly short of 1.3% estimates. </li>\n<li>*<strong>*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) with a host of target raises.
