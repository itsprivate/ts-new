To put in perspective, if markets were flat, amazon alone would contribute 0.15% drop in VT (all equities worldwide) 0.3% in VOO (sp500) and 0.63% in QQQ The drop is enough, in theory, to send 1100 dollars to every us household. In terms of marketcap leaders, apple is 2.4 trillion, microsoft is 2.15 trillion, saudi aramco is at 1.85 trillion, google is 1.8 trillion, amazon is 1.67 trillion. google surpasses amazon in marketcap due to strong surge as earnings beat expectations by more than 40%. amazon missed revenue and guidance was below expectations. this is one of the few times amazon misses earnings, and one of the worst % drops for amazon not including 2000,2008 crash.\n\nIn my opinion, this drop is exaggerated. most of the drop is because of sales dropping and bad guidance, but most of revenue comes from retail. But most of the profit comes from aws and ads, and both of the business has accelerated this year. Retail is low margin business, usually 2-3% whereas 20-30% for ads and aws. so aws and ads revenue is 10 times more valuable. People pay attention to revenue as a whole instead of the segments making the profits. I would consider to buy this stock but im more of an etf guy, so i dont have a position.\n\nsources: companiesmarketcap, vanguard/nasdaq site.",
