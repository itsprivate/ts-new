However, after closing red, both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) turned green after-hours on the back of Apple’s (AAPL) monster earnings report. \n\nMarket participants continue to digest yesterday’s FOMC statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference and newly released US GDP data. \n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.49 \n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.01% \n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.03% \n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.27% \n* Volatility Index (VIX): -4.60%\n* Apple (AAPL): +4.50% after-hours\n* Tesla (TSLA): -11.55%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): -14.10%\n* Lending Club (LC): -28.13%\n* Teradyne (TER): -22.44%\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released its first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. For the full-year 2021, GDP grew at a 5.7% rate, marking the fastest since 1984. And this marked a sharp reversal from the contraction seen in the economy in 2020 when GDP shrank by 3.4%. Here were the main metrics from the print, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\n\n* **GDP quarter-over-quarter, annualized:** 6.9% vs. 5.5% expected, 2.3% in Q3\n* **Personal consumption:** 3.3% vs. 3.4% expected, 2.0% in Q3\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter**: 4.9% vs. 4.9% expected, 4.6% in Q3\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)\n\nIn yesterday’s monetary policy decision, the Fed held rates at near-zero and reaffirmed plans to finish tapering by March, at which point we will likely see the first interest rate hike of the year. Higher rates could address inflation by raising borrowing costs and dampening demand — particularly for goods.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said, “With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March”. It is likely the first interest hike will come either in March or April, after the Fed completes tapering.\n\nHere is the entire statement: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf)\n\nIn his press conference following the meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said, “I would say that the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming conditions are appropriate for doing so. \n\nBut the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee unanimously agreed that “it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,” and Powell’s commentary suggests the first increase will happen on March 16.\n\nCharlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said “While offering some clarity on how the Fed would begin the process of removing policy accommodation, the outcome of the meeting fell short in providing the needed guidance on the timing and magnitude of the shift in policy. Today’s meeting has market participants fully convinced that a March hike is certain, but with Chairman Powell not making any timing commitments, the door is slightly open for a slower moving Fed.\"\n\nThe Labor Department released its weekly jobless report, which showed first-time claims unexpectedly jumping to the highest level since October 2021, potentially a sign of renewed virus-related disruptions due to the surge of Omicron. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 286,000 vs. 225,000 expected and a revised 231,000 during the prior week\n* **Continuing claims:** 1.635 million vs. 1.563 million expected and a revised 1.551 million during the prior week\n\nDespite notching a quarterly profit and sales well above analyst estimates for the fourth quarter, shares of Tesla closed down 11.55% to $829.10 a piece after the electric vehicle maker admitted supply chain woes were likely to strain operations and halt new vehicle launches this year. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $2.52 per share, vs. $2.36 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $17.72 billion, vs. $16.57 billion expected, up 65% YoY\n* **Auto Sales:** $15.97 billion, up 71% YoY\n* **Energy Generation &amp; Storage:** $688 million vs $815.5 million expected, down 8% YoY\n* **Gross Margin:** 27.4% vs 26.6% the previous quarter\n* **Net Income**: $2.32 billion, up a staggering 760% YoY\n\nApple (AAPL), the largest company in the stock market, gapped up 4% at the time of writing after reporting exceptional earnings, which showed sales grew despite ongoing supply-chain disruptions. Apple lifted the SPY and QQQ, which turned green after-hours on the back of Apple’s beat. Here are the numbers: \n\n* **EPS**: $2.10 vs. $1.89 estimated, up 25% year-over-year\n* **Revenue**: $123.9 billion vs. $118.66 billion estimated, up 11% year-over-year\n* **iPhone revenue**: $71.63 billion vs. $68.34 billion estimated, up 9% year-over-year\n* **Services revenue**: $19.52 billion vs. $18.61 billion estimated, up 24% year-over-year\n* **Other Products revenue**: $14.70 billion vs. $14.59 billion estimated, up 13% year-over-year\n* **Mac revenue**: $10.85 billion vs. $9.52 billion estimated, up 25% year-over-year\n* **iPad revenue**: $7.25 billion vs. $8.18 billion estimated, down 14% year-over-year\n* **Gross margin**: 43.8% vs. 41.7% estimated\n\nTim Cook said, “What we expect for the March quarter is solid year-over-year revenue growth. And we expect supply constraints in the March quarter to be less than they were in the December quarter.”\n\n“*\"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\"* \\-Eleanor Roosevelt",
