The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting -- released on Wednesday -- pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.\n\nAll this could spell trouble for active managers with broad market exposures since so many stocks are off their recent highs. \n\nThe Nasdaq Composite index is on pace for its biggest weekly decline since November, even as it rose in the New York afternoon trading session Thursday. A 3.3% fall Wednesday marked its worst single-day session since February last year.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/number-of-nasdaq-stocks-down-50-or-more-is-almost-at-a-record-1.1704111",
