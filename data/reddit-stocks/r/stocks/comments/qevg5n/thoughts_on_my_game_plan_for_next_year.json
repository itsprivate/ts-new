I got about 40k in etfs but I’m starting to get worried. With the supply chain shortage being forecasted for the majority of next year and the fed saying they’re gunna start tapering November of next year too,(which id imagine means they’re liable to taper in the summer), is anyone worried that we’re nearing the end of the bull market or at least a steep correction? Stocks just can’t stay overvalued for too long without great growth. I have another 15k and more coming in cash to throw at a big dip but I’d hate find out I rolled the dice on gains this year when all of this spelled for a disaster that I just ignored. Maybe I should sell off in the spring time and wait for everything to stabilize a bit more? Just play a few personals to pass the time? Kinda nervous about November earnings too if someone could help me on what to expect. Thanks guys!",
