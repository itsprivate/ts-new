Ready to harass me with unkind things?\n\nBefore you do here are some facts:\n\nI make $11 an hour and work 40 hours a week.\n\nI make enough to invest over $1000 a month.\n\nI only spend $400 a month out of my $1500 - $2000 monthly pay.\n\nI plan on getting an apartment in 2022 at some point as well as a better job.\n\nI want to invest for the long term. My ideal minimum goal would be 10 percent profit every year and take out 4 percent per year when I retire.\n\nI have looked at many stocks past 5 year history and many of them are skyrocket. The ones that seem to go up up up and never really go down in the long term would be the ones I think I would invest in.\n\nI have at least a year of savings at $400 a month meaning my savings is at least $5000.\n\nHaving finally looked into stocks and looking up videos for about 100 hours and still having no real true 100 percent plan I know a few things. First: Stock market seems better than a savings account. Second: If I had invested 5 years ago I would have so much more money. Third: It seems some stocks will almost always profit over the long term. Forth: Inflation means stocks are a decent option instead of a bank.\n\nI did put a very small amount of money into stocks and so far have a 2.5 percent return. I put the money in 3 stocks and it increased. That was 24 hours ago.\n\nI have a decent savings account and I was wondering if I should put it all into stocks. The truth is if I put $5000 into stocks and lost it all I would not lose my life and could make it back but it would hurt my heart and make me want to stay in my car a bit longer.\n\nI currently am trying to better myself and I have come a long way. I won't get into that so try not to judge me to harshly. Right now I am at a point where I can invest a bit more at a low paying job, but I do intend on getting a better job when I can and then get an apartment so I can have a home and invest more money as well. But I also have no friends and no family. I am all on my own with the grace of God and perhaps your input here...\n\nBut currently $1000 is completely able to put into the stock market  every month.\n\nWhere do YOU personally put your money and where would YOU personally put your money if you were in my situation?\n\nWith inflation is it okay to start investing or is it too late now?\n\nWould it be best to stick with the stocks that seem to have a history of doing well or would they be overvalued due to the inflation lately?\n\nIn the long term what stocks do you feel will stand the test of time and keep raising even in times of trouble?\n\nPlease provide your thoughts and hope I am not too much of a loser. Thanks.",
