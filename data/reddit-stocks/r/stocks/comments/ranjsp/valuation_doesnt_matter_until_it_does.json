Well, all of those high multiples, and irrational stocks, have been tanking hard in the past two weeks. It all started when Disney and Paypal started to tank, a lot of stocks followed such as Twilo, PLTR, DKNG, SQ, ZM, meme stocks, and all the others.\n\nFinancial markets are forward looking, as announced, the FED will start tapering soon, and will increase the interest rate in 2022 most likely. So all the growth stocks will be hit by a higher expected return on the Discounted Cash Flow models, and with more conservative multiples. We can forecast a shrinking of PE / PE1 / PS ratios. However, with the bond market offering such a low yield, **we can expect higher stock multiples than usual**. A good stock with a P/E of 20 is way more attractive risk/reward than anything else. There's no place to park money, and with inflation, cash is trash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are the opportunities this market offers?\n\nIf the elevator is going down (growth stocks), it is better to take the stairs. However, the market will still offer a great return (in my opinion) for the year 2022. Stocks selection will be crucial.\n\n\\-Cyclical stocks: With the economy re-opening, cyclical stocks will be very hot. Stocks like McDonald's, Walmart, Bath&amp;BodyWorks, Airlines, cars marker will all beneficiate from people that cannot wait to go out to spend their money once they are allowed to do so.\n\n\\-Financials: As we said, markets are forward looking, financial stocks will beneficiate from an interest rate hike.\n\n\\-FAANG+M: Those companies rule the World. They are money printing machine, and they will all keep growing. They are a little bit more expensive, but you have to pay a premium for such quality companies that have a lot to offer.\n\n\\-Energy: This one is a shorter trade. Supply cannot keep up with demand. Joe Biden doesn't want the US to produce more oil, the OPEC+ is in the driver's seat, and US oil companies are distributing the cash to investors instead of drilling more. Price of oil will keep going up in, at least, the first half of 2022. Both Chevron and Exxon offer more than 4.5% in dividend yield, and they will see their stock price going up accordingly with oil prices.\n\n\\-Buying leaps on the SPY: It is hard to go wrong with this one. The problem with options is the timing. If you buy long duration call options on the SPY during dips, you will most likely see a profit. This one is for a bit experienced investors. Be careful to not lose all your money.\n\nI wish you all the best luck in your investments, I hope this will help some people.",
