This winter break, we made it a goal to develop a system that can paper trade + real-trade stock strategies that we have. We spent a LOT of hours on this system (over 12,000 LOC), and wanted to share it with a community who might find it neat!</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we’re just using the paper trading functionality until we have money we can risk. The system is implemented in such a way so that we can hold multiple stock trading strategies. It helps inform us about our trades, because for any stock we encounter, we can easily track the stock’s performance.</p>\n\n<p>If anybody wants more details about the system, we’d be happy to answer them! We were also thinking of making an in-depth YouTube video explaining the system if people here seem interested.</p>\n\n<p>I was also wondering if anybody’s interested we can make a community portfolio of sorts. Just comment down below your favorite stocks and we can pick the top 5/10/25 most upvoted top-level comments and put it into a community portfolio. It’d be a neat way to keep track of <a href=\"/r/stock\">/r/stock</a>’s favorite stocks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
