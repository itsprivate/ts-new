Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?)\n\nIf both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD.\n\nI don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. \n\nNow, the big question of course is.... \"What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?\"\n\nThe biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any **profits** without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2.\n\nWhat if I have an emergency and need the money?  You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it.\n\n\nHow much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year.\n\n\nI think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE.  You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. \n\n\nThe way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA.\n\nSo, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022.  Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... \"But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years\".\n\nBut remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events!\n\n\nAlso, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT.\n\n\n**NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.**",
