  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 25, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again reaching intraday record highs. It seems market participants have looked past the Federal Reserve’s July meeting minutes, which included language signaling that tapering may begin sooner rather than later, and continue to digest Q2 record-breaking earnings season and new developments coming out of Washington D.C. Looking ahead, market participants await Fed Chair Jerome Powell annual Jackson Hole speech, scheduled this Friday morning.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\nUS Crude oil prices continued gaining, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.\n\nEnergy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.\n\nYesterday, The House of Representatives voted to adopt a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, taking a major step toward enacting President Biden’s ambitious economic agenda that calls for increased spending on education, health care and renewable energy. The 220-212 vote, which fell along partisan lines, was originally delayed after a group of moderate Democrats said they would not approve the budget until the infrastructure bill was voted on. \n\nFollowing the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “Passing an infrastructure bill is always exciting for what it means in terms of jobs and commerce in our country.” President Biden thanked every member of the House, saying, “There were differences. Strong points of view. They’re always welcome. What’s important is that we came together to advance our agenda.”\n\nFederal Reserve's virtual Jackson Hole Symposium, which kicks off on Thursday. After last week's July Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes came off as more hawkish than many market participants were expecting, more clues on the path forward for monetary policy remain a key focal point. Namely, traders are looking to see whether central bank officials signal when they will announce and implement tapering of pandemic-era quantitative easing.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Mortgage applications unexpectedly rose, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Overall applications were up 1.6% during the week ended August 20, following a drop of 3.9% during the previous week. Home purchases led the advances, with these rising 3% week-on-week on a seasonally adjusted basis to reach the highest level since early July.\n* Western Digital (WDC) is in advanced talks to merge with Japanese semiconductor company Kioxia in a deal valued roughly $20 billion.\n* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued absolutely beasting, which makes me so happy. As I have said before, NVDA is by far my favorite stock in the market.\n* President Joe Biden called cybersecurity a \"core national security challenge\" in a meeting with leaders from Silicon Valley, the water and energy sectors, the banking and insurance industries and academic institutions on Wednesday to discuss [shoring up the nation's cybersecurity.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/cybersecurity-executive-order/index.html) IMO cybersecurity stocks are a great place to look into for future value.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with a host of target raises. Average price target $240 at Outperform. Stock currently around $212\n* Affirm (AFRM) target raised by Bank of America from $71 to $82 at Buy.
