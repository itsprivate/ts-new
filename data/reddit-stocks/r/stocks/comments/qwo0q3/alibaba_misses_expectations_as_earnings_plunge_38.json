Alibaba was fined $2.8 billion in April as part of an anti-monopoly probe.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, China’s economy slowed down in the third quarter of the year.  \n\n\nExpectations were low coming into the fiscal second-quarter earnings report as a result, with analysts expecting it to be one of the most challenging quarters ever for the Chinese e-commerce giant.  \n\n\nThe company is coming off the back of Singles Day, a huge shopping event in China where e-commerce platforms push heavy discounts and rack up billions of dollars of sales.  \n\n\nAlibaba raked in gross merchandise volume during the 11-day period totaling 540.3 billion yuan ($84.54 billion). Any revenue Alibaba gets from this event will not be reflected in the September quarter.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/alibaba-earnings-fiscal-q2-revenue-misses-earnings-plunge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/alibaba-earnings-fiscal-q2-revenue-misses-earnings-plunge.html)",
