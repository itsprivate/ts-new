But the labor markets are historically well off, GDP growth is high, covid cases are going down - and really can only improve from here, supply chains are slowly unwinding, and inflation is peaking. \n\nImagine covid being a long hike up a mountain with chances of slipping from lockdowns, liquidity drying up , bank runs, tangled supply chains etc etc. We've gone up that mountain and now we can finally start hiking back down. We see unemployment at pre-pandemic levels and our society is learning how to transition from a pandemic response to an endemic response. Of course this descent back down the mountain does require us to keep our footing. I personally have faith in J Powell in taking the safe, conservative approach of predictable, incremental, and slow rate hikes/ quantitative tightening to give a chance to see how improving supply chains decelerate inflation. I personally think Russia is mostly posturing and no real conflict will come of this. I personally think covid has accelerated technological advancement in many ways. And as soon as omicron cases start to dissipate near spring, consumers will begin to use their purchasing power on more industries, specifically hospitality/ travel. As EVs and clean energy continue to come online, less reliance on oil will continue, and not just in the US but globally. \n\nI really don't see much downside risk after this recent correction. You could say any slips and falls going down the mountain have been mostly priced in by now. I mean we have room to breathe. I think now is one of the rare times during a correction where you can feel comfortable about \"buying the dip\". Think about all the other market corrections/ crashes. In '08, when banks were going out of business and houses lost half their price, things were A LOT more uncertain. When unemployment rose at a faster pace than any other time in history and peaked at a figure not seen since the 50s, no one knew how long it would last and many thought this was going to lead to a second Great Depression. Now, markets are almost 10% down on the S&amp;P500 and over 15% down in the NASDAQ. We have to ask ourselves are times really this uncertain? I think many of you may be in for a surprise to see how quickly inflation will taper off and how quickly supply chains will fix themselves. I am personally very bullish about the future in the US and globally.",
