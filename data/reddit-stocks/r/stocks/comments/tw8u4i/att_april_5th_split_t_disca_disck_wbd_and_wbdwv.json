Sorry for the copy n paste.  Important here to note that you will not receive fractional shares of $WBD and receive cash payout 10 days after the split for all fractional $WBD shares. \n\nIf you own AT&amp;T stock at the end of trading on Monday, April 4, you will receive two temporary stocks in addition to your AT&amp;T \"T\" stock before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5. \n\nThe first temporary stock you will receive before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5, is under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ticker symbol \"T WI.\" If you sell \"T WI,\" you will be selling only AT&amp;T common stock while retaining the right to receive shares of WBD common stock. \n\nThe second temporary stock you will receive before the market opens on Tuesday, April 5, is under the Nasdaq symbol \"WBDWV.\" If you sell \"WBDWV\" you will be selling your right to receive shares of Warner Bros. Discovery common stock while retaining your shares of AT&amp;T common stock. \n\nAT&amp;T Shareholders may not have very long to decide because the recording date for the new Warner Bros. Discovery shares is at the close of business on Tuesday, April 5. If you do nothing, you will retain your AT&amp;T \"T\" common stock and own Warner Bros. Discovery common stock once the merger is complete.  \n\nAfter the merger is complete, the temporary stocks \"T WI\" and \"WBDWV\" will cease to exist, and AT&amp;T's \"T\" stock price will adjust lower to reflect the loss of WarnerMedia.\n\nFinally, WBD will not issue any fractional shares of its common stock. As a result, you would receive cash compensation for any fractional shares within 10 business days of the merger.",
