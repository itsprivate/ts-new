Quick credentials: I am a Director at a nationwide developer of large-scale, ground-mounted solar projects.\n\nIn simple terms, ARRY makes “single-axis trackers”. Solar panels sit on top of the single-axis trackers, which rotate from east to west as the sun rises and sets, maximizing energy production. This style of racking has become the industry standard in recent years, and ARRY is the best one, in my opinion. With a single motor and a single center driveshaft, their technology can rotate over 3,000 solar panels. They are a market leader, based in the US, and the largest factor in their input cost is steel.\n\nThere are 3 reasons why I’m bullish:\n\n1. The massive reconciliation bill currently in front of congress could pass any day now. It would dramatically increase and **extend the solar investment tax credit and feature a “domestic content requirement”**, which requires a percentage of the capital investment to go toward US made or assembled products. A rising tide lifts all ships, plus ARRY is uniquely positioned to satisfy the domestic content requirement.\n2. ARRY’s Q3 earning’s report is expected on **November 4**. There’s been an unprecedented steel shortage that has wreaked havoc on ARRY and other companies heavily reliant on steel. My guess is the earnings report will be not amazing but decent. And a decent earnings report would indicate light at the end of the tunnel regarding the steel shortage – this is the primary thing holding this stock back over the last 6 months.\n3. As the price of steel comes back down to Earth, ARRY may maintain its current pricing, which means they could have a **significantly higher profit margin than they did pre-steel-shortage**.\n\nDisclaimers: Most of my company’s solar projects use ARRY’s solar racking equipment. I am not a financial advisor, and I personally own some ARRY stock. This opinion is the product of public information and my own professional experience - I don't have access to any confidential intel on ARRY.",
