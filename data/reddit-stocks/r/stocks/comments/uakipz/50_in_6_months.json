I started the 4th quarter of 2021 very optimistically and added new stocks into my portfolio. But now most of those stocks have gone red with one of them even dropping almost 70%. When the shit started going red I tried doing some damage control, but I guess it wasn't enough. I stopped caring about my portfolio since it wasn't big and focused on things in real life. I thought to myself that I just need to hold on and everything will stabilize itself, but with the shit in the world only becoming shitier my portfolio has been only going down with some insignificant outliers. So, I came to Reddit to ask you what would you do in my situation?   \nFor context the stocks in my portfolio: SE, PYPL, CRSR, BRK.B, ZS, HDB, CRWD, RVLV, MSFT, NVDA.",
