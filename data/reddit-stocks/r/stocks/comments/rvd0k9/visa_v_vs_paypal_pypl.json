This recent dip makes people believe that PayPal is at a crazy discount right now and leads to a lot of retail investors btding. I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal.\n\nHowever, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle.\n\n**Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently)**\n\nMany people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market.  I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa?\n\nOverall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa.\n\n**Growth**\n\nVisa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3%\n\nPayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01\n\nWhile visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32\n\nIndicating a similar growth between the 2 companies.\n\n**Dividend**\n\nPayPal has no dividends currently\n\nVISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Margins**\n\nVisa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through.\n\nPayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s.\n\n**Concerns**\n\nFor me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor.\n\n**Overall,**\n\nThe growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol. Overall if I were to compare these 2 at their current prices, I would rather put my money into Visa.",
