Are we today already basing their stock price on the 2031 Q3 Earnings Report? 2032 Q1? This is also just one example of how overvalued some stocks are today. Can anybody make some sense of this? Do you think this will correct itself or is this what the market has become now and this is just how it will be in the future?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
