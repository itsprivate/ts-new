I'll make my case below.\n\nI will not share the video with my analysis as that would be considered self-promotion.\n\nMcDonald's makes money in two ways:\n\n1. Company-owned restaurants - The revenue has significantly decreased in the last decade. This part of the business is related to the restaurants that McDonald's operates and the revenue represents the sales of burgers, fries, beverages, and pretty much everything that is on the menu. It represents about 40% of all the revenue and the operating margin is very low (8%).\n2. Franchised restaurants - This is the part that has been increasing over time, now represents the remaining part of the revenue, and has an operating margin of 73%. However, unlike the first business segment, in this one, they make 64% of the revenue from collecting rent and the remaining 36% from royalties.\n\nIf you look at the total revenue of the company, you'll see a decline for a decade, accompanied by an increase in the operating profit which is not surprising. Instead of owning the restaurants, McDonald's is renting them to individuals who would like to have their own business and on top of that, they're collecting royalties. So the type of revenue shifted from the low-margin \"Sale of burgers, fries, beverages, shakes, and ice-creams\" to the high-margin \"collecting rent and royalties\".\n\nFrom an operating profit point of view, 60% comes from rent, 30% from royalties, and 10% from actually company-owned restaurants. Therefore, my conclusion is, that it currently operates as a real estate company that rents branded properties.\n\nAfter finishing my analysis and preparing my presentation for recording a video, I take some time to do a quick research online on the company, mainly to figure out if I'm missing something. I often stumble upon certain videos and I'm disappointed that many of them have basic checklists without understanding the business and providing value for the viewer. These come mainly in the form of \"Did the revenue increase in the last 5 years? Do we have a P/E of &lt; X\". In the case of McDonald's, if you have a checklist, you would not have a check on the revenue growth in the last 5 years and without understanding the company, you'd have a wrong impression on McDonald's. Finding good investment opportunities takes a lot more than having a simple checklist that most 6-year olds can use.\n\nSo, I did value McDonald's based on the following assumptions:\n\nRevenue - 5% growth in the next 6 years, then growing slower after that (Similar to analysts' forecasts for the next few years)\n\nOperating margin - 45% (No significant change compared to the last few years, also in line with the analysts' forecasts)\n\nWACC - 5.91%\n\nOutcome: $150.90/share (Much lower than the current stock price)\n\nBelow is an overview of the value of the company based on different assumptions related to revenue growth (in 10 years) &amp; operating margins:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|45%|50%|55%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|48% ($34.5b)|$150.9|$173.9|$196.8|\n|60% ($37.2b)|$161.5|$186.1|$210.7|\n|80% ($41.8b)|$178.5|$205.8|$233.0|\n|100% ($46.5b)|$165.3|$224.9|$254.8|\n\nI'd like to get your thoughts on the company and see if there's anything significant that I'm missing from my assumptions.",
