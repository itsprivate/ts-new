Isn&#39;t the point to learn trading option from knowledgeable people I don&#39;t get it? Anyhow, maybe someone here can reassure me.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve gotten a bit more comfortable with basic options trading over the past 6 months. I still consider selling a put option a basic task but very important to add to the repertoire for setting up more complex strategies. I want to start getting more comfortable with this type of trade as well. I want to keep the first one small just to make sure I don&#39;t screw it up or lose a bunch of money. I&#39;ll outline the trade below and just want to make sure there&#39;s no huge potential for loss here.</p>\n\n<p>I want to own Palantir (PLTR) at $23.5, it is currently trading at $26. My assumption is that I can sell the put option (sell to open) contract for a strike price of $23.5 for whatever date I choose (looking short term just to start off - say April 1). If the price of PLTR drops to $23.5 at any point during that period and gets executed, I am assigned the shares at the strike price of $23.5 (minus the premium I receive so actually less than $23.5 overall). If it never hits the strike price of $23.5, the contract expires I get no shares but I collect the premium. Am I missing something on this that might cost me a bunch of money? I know that I need to ensure I have the capitol in my portfolio to cover the cost of the contract if it gets executed, that&#39;s not an issue. But my concern is my Brokerage states my maximum loss potential is $2,239 which scares me. I&#39;m assuming that the $2,239 loss is actually just the cost for purchasing the shares minus the premium received, but that to me is not a loss I still own an underlying equity worth $2350 (i.e. no loss).  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
