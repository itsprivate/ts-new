I make a humble income and this portfolio is most of my networth, so this has been incredibly difficult for me. \n\nThat being said, I would like some advice from here. Some may think I trade high-risk options with that kind of money. Actually not really, my holdings include Nio, Tesla, Eyes, Joby, Sofi, Aht, Btx, Mp, Cpe, Arkg, Arkk, Spce, Dkng, Fubo, Amc, Clov, Rlx, etc. I used 10-20% margin at some point that looked like buying opportunities which I shouldn’t have of course. \n\nMost of the time I just buy and hold (I didn’t even buy at the highest price). When stocks keep going down, I buy more. I don’t know how it happened but many of these stocks have gone down 70%+?? I don’t have any cash now and my portfolio is down 70%. I even sold some covered calls to hedge. \n\nWhat’s incredibly scary is that many experts keep saying a crash/recession coming soon. I don’t know what I’m supposed to think or do. Cutting losses now??? My stocks have crashed so hard already except Tesla, Mp, Cpe. I really don’t know what a crash means for those ultra growth stocks which have gone down 80% already?..and it’s been very difficult for me to cut losses at this deep (and I don’t know if there’s still a point in doing so)\n\nLuckily I’m no longer on margin and I didn’t invest all my savings. So I’m not desperately in need of the 350k right now and can wait maybe 3-5 years. But what to do now? should I sell everything or keep my holdings or revise my portfolio? I can’t really afford to lose the money in the long run. And all this in the past year has been hurting my mental health. Anyone has any advice?",
