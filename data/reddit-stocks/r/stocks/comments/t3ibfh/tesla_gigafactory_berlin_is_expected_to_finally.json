Gigafactory Berlin, a critical new factory for Tesla’s plans to expand in Europe and improve its manufacturing and distribution efficiency, has been in limbo for months.\n\nThe automaker has yet to secure the needed environmental permit to start producing vehicles for customer deliveries. Last month, Tesla confirmed that it built the first few Model Ys at Gigafactory Berlin at the end of 2021.\n\nThe automaker also received approval to build 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory Berlin ahead of the final approval by the state of Brandenburg. Tesla said it needed to conduct more tests of its production process, and it hasn’t been approved to deliver those vehicles. However, it looks like the factory is up and running with hundreds of new Model Y vehicles spotted coming out of the factory last week.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2022/02/28/tesla-gigafactory-berlin-expected-finally-receive-approval-production-this-week/](https://electrek.co/2022/02/28/tesla-gigafactory-berlin-expected-finally-receive-approval-production-this-week/)",
