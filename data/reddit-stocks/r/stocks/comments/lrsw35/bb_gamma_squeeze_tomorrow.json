That price places quite a few call options in the money. T<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrsn56/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/\">ake a look at the open interest for calls expiring this Friday</a> (i.e., Feb. 26) at strike prices of $11.00, $11.50, and $12.00. You are looking at 18,722 contracts open as of the close of trading today (i.e., Feb. 24).</p>\n\n<p>Given the sell-off in the NASDAQ this week, many hedge funds / others thought BB was going to stay under $11. (Look at the spike in open interest at $11). I bet a bunch of the options at $11 and above were written naked. If BB can close above $13 tomorrow, a boat load of call options will be in the money. Friday could bring a gamma squeeze where BB really takes off.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
