From what I see, no company can produce EVs as cheaply, as high quality and as many as Tesla (not even Chinese EVs). They have the trifecta of manufacturing and EVs are still in the early adoption phase. Legacy auto makers have stagnant evaluations for the last decade.\n\nTesla is also the current leader in FSD technology, although it has a long way to go, growth in AI is exponential and we will get there eventually within a reasonable time frame. Tesla is going to be more of a robotaxi company than a car company. The economic gain of robotaxis is going to be insane, cars sit idle 95% of the time any decent economist will tell you that is money being lit on fire. If they can reduce that to just 70% idle, it will result in at least a trillion saved by not requiring a driver, increased speed of traffic, reduced accidents, and most importantly (in US and Canada) not being financially burdened by owning a car just to name a few.\n\nIt is more correct to say a Tesla revolution than an EV revolution. I did my research on TSLA back in mid 2021 and I strongly believe that today, in terms of information available and TSLA financials, is the best time to invest because there is very little uncertainty. If your bearish on Tesla I want to know why and if I'm missing anything in my arguments.",
