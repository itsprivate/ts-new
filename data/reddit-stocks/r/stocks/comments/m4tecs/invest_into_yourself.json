READ. READ. READ.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t know anything about something - simply do a search, don’t be pressured into clicking the first link you see though; go deep. </p>\n\n<p>Go 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 + pages deep. </p>\n\n<p>Does it still make sense? </p>\n\n<p>Or does it continue to seem like more and more bullshit as you go to the next page? </p>\n\n<p>Keep turning the pages in your book. </p>\n\n<p>Never stop reading. </p>\n\n<p>Your brain needs it.</p>\n\n<p>Write more too; especially when it comes to your investments.  </p>\n\n<p>Journal your thoughts on why your investment is good or bad.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, continue to invest in yourself.</p>\n\n<p>When I say invest in yourself I don’t mean to go deposit $500 into a high interest savings account that’s going to yield you a whopping 1% at most a year on returns.</p>\n\n<p>I mean invest in yourself in ways that will benefit you in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Start exercising more, it could be as simple as waking up in the morning and doing some heart racing cardio like jumping or pushups or sit-ups or if you’re lucky to have a treadmill or bike go for a run/walk for just 10-15 minutes to clear the air for the day.</p>\n\n<p>Think positively on yourself and others daily</p>\n\n<p>View the brighter side of things when it comes to your thoughts; sure there’s always going to be a possibility of a bad outcome but why fear the worst in life? </p>\n\n<p>Life is too short to fear the unknown! </p>\n\n<p>Always have your head up high ready to go with confidence! </p>\n\n<p>We are all unique.</p>\n\n<p>We are all human. </p>\n\n<p>We all love.</p>\n\n<p>Remember - investing in yourself is investing in others when they see your energy that’s being thrown off; domino effects do work ✌️</p>\n\n<p>Now; what should I go and Invest in? And what should others go and invest in?</p>\n\n<p>Remember - RESEARCH! ❤️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
