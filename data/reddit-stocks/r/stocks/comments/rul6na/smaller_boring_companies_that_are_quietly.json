I no longer live near one, but wish I did.\n\nEquity Lifestyle Properties (ELS) - REIT focused on relatively nice retirement mobile home communities.

Not exactly cheap, but not overpriced either.\n\nWhat are your ideas along these lines? There must be a lot of profitable, growing and potentially undervalued small caps hiding on the fringes where most don’t look.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the wonderful suggestions. I haven’t looked through all of them yet, but I will, and suspect many of you do the same. This will keep me busy for weeks! So many companies I would most likely never have been aware of.
