All that money so far has gone into very risky stocks and although I really like those companies, I’d like to start investing into ETFs. \n\nI’m looking for ETFs that have the most growth potential for the next 5-10 years and then I’ll look into moving it into even safer avenues. As I mentioned before I am newer to investing and recently learned about leveraged ETFs and I believe this is what I’m looking for.
