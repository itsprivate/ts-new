  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 20, 2022**\n\nThe stock market struggled for direction, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) eventually closing red after jumping roughly 2% early on in the session. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve’s hawkish pivot, a fresh weekly unemployment report, and ongoing earnings season. \n\nThe Labor Department released its weekly unemployment report on Thursday, which showed first-time claims unexpectedly jumping compared to consensus estimates, a sign of disruptions caused by the Omicron-driven surge of COVID infections. Claims had reached a 52-year low of 188,000 in December, as many employers attempted to keep their existing workforces in the face of widespread labor shortages.\n\nHere are the numbers: \n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 286,000 vs. 225,000 expected and a revised 231,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims:** 1.635 million vs. 1.563 million expected and a revised 1.551 million during prior week\n\nThe Fed is currently in a blackout period ahead of its policy-setting meeting next week but remained in focus as Treasury yields continued to rise, briefly topping 1.9%, the highest level since January 2020, before retreating to 1.85%. \n\nRecent market volatility can be attributed to the multidecade jump in consumer and producer prices reported last week, which served as a reminder that inflation remains the key driver of risk and uncertainty in the year ahead. \n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 7% in December compared to a year ago, the fastest pace of increase since 1982 and the eighth straight month in which inflation exceeded 5%. Excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, core CPI rose 5.5%, the most since 1991.\n\nLike last year, inflation in the prices of goods played a large part in the jump. For example, prices of used cars and trucks soared 37%, and furniture prices rose 14% from a year ago. While pandemic-related supply-and-demand imbalances continue to drive prices for durable goods higher, services inflation is also strengthening but to a lesser extent, rising 3.7% in December. \n\nOn the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sank -20% after and fell below the original IPO price of $29 after the company announced it was halting production of its products citing consumer demand declines and desire to cut costs. \n* National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that existing home sales fell 4.6% to a seasonally adjusted 6.18 million units in December from a month earlier. November’s existing-home sales were revised slightly down to 6.46 million from 6.48 million. The number of sales was down 7.1% from the same month a year ago and came in far below analysts' expectations of a 0.5% month-over-month decrease\n* Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz is teaming up with self-driving sensor maker Luminar Technologies Inc. (LAZR) to pursue fully-automated driving \n* Netflix (NFLX) stock plummeted after reporting earnings today after-hours.\n* China cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points. The home mortgage rate was also cut by 5 basis points. Following the lending rate cuts, shares of U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies traded mostly higher in Hong Kong on Thursday, lifting the benchmark Hang Seng Index to its highest level in almost two months\n* Microsoft (MSFT) acquired beleaguered videogame maker Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) in a blockbuster $70 billion deal. Not to get into it, but ATVI has been facing some massive controversies recently. \n* Shares of Social Finance Technologies (SOFI) soared after the company received approval from the Office of the Comptroller of Current and the Federal Reserve to become a bank holding company. In order to become a bank, SoFi plans to acquire California community lender Golden Pacific Bancorp and operate its bank subsidiary as SoFi Bank. The deal was announced last year and is expected to close in February.\n* The Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee is seeking to list publicly in the United States after being removed from the Nasdaq in 2020 following an accounting scandal, according to a report from the Financial Times. \n\n“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.” *-*Walt Disney",
