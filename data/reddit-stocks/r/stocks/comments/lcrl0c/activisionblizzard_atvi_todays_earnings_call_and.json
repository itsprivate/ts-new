Reports are saying $3.05 billion versus $2.78 billion expected, and earnings per share: $1.21 versus $1.17 expected:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html</a></p>\n\n<p>I don’t own any at the moment, but I wish I had made a major investment. I had been filtering stocks, and a few stats about Activision stuck out to me. Activision has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Over 70% gross profit margin</li>\n<li>Over 30% growth in earnings per share this quarter</li>\n<li>Over 30% growth in sales this quarter</li>\n<li>Positive sales growth over past five years</li>\n<li>P/E under 40</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Only five other large cap stocks share these characteristics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alexandria Real Estate - ARE</li>\n<li>Facebook - FB<br/></li>\n<li>Horizon Therapeutics - HZNP</li>\n<li>KKR &amp; Co. - KKR</li>\n<li>Vertex Pharma - VRTX<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Every other stock with those growth, sales, and margin numbers are stocks with insanely high P/E ratios, like Etsy (123) or NovoCure (2486 lol). But you’ve got this group of stocks with what looks like value P/E ratios under 40: Activision, Facebook, two medical tech companies, and two financial companies. And all of them are generally regarded as strong buys. </p>\n\n<p>But there’s something unique in my mind about Activision. Biotech is volatile, prone to setbacks on a technical or regulatory level even before you start talking business fundamentals. And I know the finance companies are good buys. But Activision’s business model seems more insulated from the some of the pitfalls of the market. It was a strong COVID business and not one that I personally see taking a post-COVID recovery hit. </p>\n\n<p>This is one of those rare companies where the numbers looks fantastic, I’m familiar with the industry, and I like the company’s products. I’ll probably get invested soon. Just going to wait to see how its price responds to the earnings call. I&#39;d be very interested to hear what others think.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
