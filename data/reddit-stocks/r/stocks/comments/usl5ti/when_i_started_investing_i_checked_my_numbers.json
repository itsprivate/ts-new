I'm confident that the value of my collective retirement savings is down by some obscene number, but I'm not worried about it at all because I'm invested in things that I truly believe are smart long-term funds (mostly target-date funds, a smattering of the S&amp;P, and a small handful of long-established financial companies).  \n\nI used to get really disappointed at seeing something go down 4-5% over the course of a few weeks or months.  Unreasonably disappointed.  Like, kicking myself for \"not timing it better\".  Stupid, I know.\n\nLet me tell you newer investors: if you're picking responsible funds and have automatic payments set up (via a 401k, recurring payments to an IRA, etc), there is a great peace to be found in just letting things continue without obsessively tracking it.  If you're close to retirement age, this is obviously not advice I would impart on you.  But if you've got a long way to go, just keep that brokerage app closed, head outside for a walk on a nice spring day, and enjoy the knowledge that you're currently buying retirement funds on sale instead of paying way over MSRP.",
