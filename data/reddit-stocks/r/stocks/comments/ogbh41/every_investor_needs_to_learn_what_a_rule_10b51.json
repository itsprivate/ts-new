Most people are aware that company insiders are beholden to very strict regulations regarding insider trading.

Company insiders obviously always know more than the public, so almost any trade they make could potentially be considered an insider trade. So how do executives trade their shares without violating the rule?\n\nTo get around this risk, many company executives are typically asked to sign what are known as 10b5-1 plans. This is essentially an agreement between themselves and a brokerage firm, outlining the exact price minimums they want to sell shares at, along with the volume and frequency. These plans are typically entered BEFORE shares are even issued, or pre-IPO if its a newly public company.\n\nThe plan does 3 things ([https://ccbjournal.com/articles/the-10b5-1-plan-what-executives-need-to-know](https://ccbjournal.com/articles/the-10b5-1-plan-what-executives-need-to-know)):\n\n* **Specifies the number of shares to be traded, along with the price and date of the purchase or sale; or**\n* **Includes a written formula, algorithm or computer program for determining the number of shares to be traded and the price and the date of the trade; or**\n* **Transfers trading authority to a third party not in possession of MNPI and prohibits the insider from exercising any subsequent influence over how, when or whether to make purchases or sales.**\n\nThe executive signs the agreement...and the brokerage carries out the trades based on the pre-determined instructions. The insider has no influence over the future sales of their stock.\n\nAt the bottom of form 4 filings in the \"Explanation of Responses\" section, look for a note that says something like: \" (1) The sales reported in this Form 4 were effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the Reporting Person\"\n\nIf you see that note, it means that insider has a 10b5-1 plan, the sale was pre-determined well in advance, and has 0 to do with the executive's sentiment towards the company.  It is 100% normal for executives to take share profit periodically to supplement their income, especially post-IPO...and means nothing about performance.\n\nNow, these plans aren't bulletproof, and can be modified or suspended. But if the insider has any MNPI, they can get in deep shit if they're caught doing something shady.\n\nOver 57% of S&P companies are under such a plan, and most new IPOs I see are doing them.\n\n10b5-1 Plan...learn it, love it, and use it to tell FUDsters to GTFO\n\n  \nEDIT: Here's some great simplified info about them: [https://media2.mofo.com/documents/faq10b51.pdf](https://media2.mofo.com/documents/faq10b51.pdf)",
