Everything else is falling into place, we are looking good.  </p>\n\n<p>Although I myself was excited to see $BB in the $12 range premarket and in the morning, I myself was wondering if we were about to see a blow-off, it looks like AMC ruled the day today.    </p>\n\n<p>Average volume daily today too which is nice to see, probably some profit-taking as we are up 40% from the bottom at 8.83 which is fine by me. People can take their pennies if they wish, I&#39;m more into the long game and swing trading ain&#39;t really my jam.</p>\n\n<p>Continue accumulating and holding, we are looking extremely strong and this pullback was very very healthy.   </p>\n\n<p>From all aspects of technical analysis standpoint, this is an absolute screaming buy.<br/>\nFrom a fundamentalist&#39;s view, those who know the sentiment, the deals, the products, and the history, this is a screaming buy.<br/>\nFrom a speculatory view or the ultra-long like 2-3 years down the road, this is a screaming buy.  </p>\n\n<p>Think of this stock as smoking a brisket or making a nice prime rib roast. We want this baby to cook low and slow, or in another way set it and forget. If you do that you&#39;ll get the tastiest, juiciest reward.   </p>\n\n<p>Take care.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
