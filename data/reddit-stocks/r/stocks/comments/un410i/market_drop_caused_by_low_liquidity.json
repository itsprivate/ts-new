The dip was caused by a UBS fund getting liquidated - but I didn't know that at the time and was simply being a buyer of last resort.\n\nThere are a lot of people getting margin called and funds needing liquidity right now, and if you have the cash you should be buying. Similarly, if you're holding shares and don't need liquidity, don't sell at the same time as people who are desperately seeking liquidity. \n\nThese are just my thoughts and not financial advice.",
