Market participants continue to be encouraged by the stronger-than-expected start of the Q3 corporate earnings season, with companies posting robust results despite ongoing supply-side disruptions and labor market imbalances. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the Fed’s monthly meeting minutes, set to be released later this week, where I expect the Fed to officially start the tapering process, and the October jobs report, which is expected to show a pick-up in hiring after two disappointing months in a row.\n\nAccording to a report by LPL Financial, November has been the best month for equities since 1950.\n\nThough some of the heavily weighted index components from last week had disappointed against consensus estimates — with both Amazon and Apple shares dropping after posting weaker-than-expected results and guidance — other stronger results helped offset these misses, with names including Alphabet and Microsoft rallying to record levels on the heels of their respective reports. \n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will meet for its monthly policy-setting meeting, which is followed by a statement and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This meeting is expected to either announce or concretely set the stage to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing which has been running at a clip of $120 billion per month. Last month, the Fed announced that amid improving economic data, the process would begin before the end of the year and would come to an end around mid-2022. \n\nGiven the market has been anticipating the start to tapering for months now, speculation around when the Fed will make a move on interest rates has become a point of particular interest to investors. This week's FOMC statement and press conference are likely to provide some more color to market participants around how committee members are thinking about the timing for interest-rate hikes, especially given the persistent jump in inflation seen in data including last week's core personal consumption expenditures report.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) continued its psycho-rally to reach a new all time high and making CEO Elon Musk the first person ever to surpass a $300 billion personal net worth.
