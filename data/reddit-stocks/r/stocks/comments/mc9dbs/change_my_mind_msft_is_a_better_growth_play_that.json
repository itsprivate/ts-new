Documents, spreadsheets, and presentations have been used for centuries if not millenniums and we will continue to use these methods of communication for centuries more. PLUS the shift to cloud is driving demand for their cloud offering Azure (50% growth in one year). It&#39;s intelligent cloud segment revenues grew 23%+ a year and quickly gaining market share. Ever since they pivoted to SaaS, their revenue and earnings have been stable and increasing so consistently - it&#39;s beautiful. Businesses will always choose Microsoft!</p>\n\n<p>Apple relies more heavily on consumer products and its total revenue and earnings haven&#39;t grown that much since 2015. What’s next after the iPhone? Car? Glasses? We&#39;re betting on them innovating in a massive way. But can they replicate the vision and innovation of Steve Jobs? Many men and women have tried... Only person doing it right now is Elon Musk. But that&#39;s besides the point.</p>\n\n<p>Check this out - financials support Microsoft as a better growth company than Apple.</p>\n\n<p>2015 to 2020 Revenue (June 2015 to Present): \n$MSFT - $93.6B to $153B (+64.5% - $59.4B growth) $AAPL - $233.7 to $294B (+25.8% - $60.3B growth)</p>\n\n<p>2015 to 2020 EBITDA (June 2015 to Present): \n$MSFT - $33.6B to $71.7B (+113% - $38.1B growth) $AAPL - $77.9B to $85.1B (+9.2% - $10.5B growth)</p>\n\n<p>2015 to 2020 Operating Profit Margin (June 2015 to Present): \n$MSFT - 19.4% to 33.4% (+72%)\n$AAPL - 30.2% to 21.7% (-28%)</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft is a cash cow and sales and profits are increasing at double digit rates. Apple is even more of a cash cow but sales and profits are slowing. Microsoft has a new core offering (Azure). Apple does not (yet). Numbers don&#39;t lie. Microsoft is a better growth play than Apple.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
