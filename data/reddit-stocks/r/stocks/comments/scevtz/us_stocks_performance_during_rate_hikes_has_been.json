Market returns tend to be muted until later in the year, as there is less certainty of the outcome and the subsequent effects on policy changes. \n\n\\----------\n\nYou can have a look at the Fed rates history at:\n\n [https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart) \n\nfor example, from end of 2015 to  beginning-mid 2019, the rate increased from 0.1% to 2.4%, that is 230 basis points!\n\nDuring this time, most big tech performed fantastically.\n\nFor example:\n\nAMZN\n\n [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/amzn/amazon/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/amzn/amazon/pe-ratio)\n\nPE fell from above 500 to around 75 during the same period\n\nAlphabet\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOGL/alphabet/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOGL/alphabet/pe-ratio)\n\nPE fell from around 35 to low 20s\n\nMeta\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/FB/meta-platforms/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/FB/meta-platforms/pe-ratio)\n\nPE fell from around 70 to mid 20s\n\nMSFT\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/msft/microsoft/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/msft/microsoft/pe-ratio)\n\nPE fell from mid 30s to mid 20s\n\nAAPL\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)\n\nPE actually rose from around 10 to around 15 \n\n So except for AAPL, all the above became massively cheap during this time.\n\nOf course, there are other things on the table like Russia-Ukraine crisis that could affect things in a way that no one can predict. But I don't think we need to worry about rate hikes effect in the long term (or even medium term) for solid companies with good cash flow like the above. For sure, there will be volatility in the coming months, but few years from now, all these will be small noise on the price or pe charts of these companies. \n\n**Personal anecdote:** \n\nDuring 2015 and 2019, I invested with a very simple strategy, where I invested in MSFT, AAPL, GOOG and AMZN on a quarterly basis, and I didn't even check my portfolio or followed business news. I didn't even know there were a crisis!  What a wise investor I was when I was younger!",
