I would like to add to my investments every month to increase the outcomes over time.\n\nI am open to suggestions and I am currently studying trading in my free time to digest all the information out there. However, I would like to secure some investment that are fool-proof in the long run before I can start on more volatile trading which I plan to do as paper trading for a year.\n\nI assume this question comes up fairly often but I wanted to know more up-to-date version. If you were 25 and wanted to take a super safe long term investment route, what would your percentages be for what funds?\n\nThank you for reading my post this far.  \n\n\nShould I go for 100% on S&P 500 for my first investment?",
