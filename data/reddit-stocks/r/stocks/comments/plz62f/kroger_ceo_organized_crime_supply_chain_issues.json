  "selftext": "Kroger (NYSE:KR) CEO Rodney McMullen said Friday that the gross margin compression that contributed to poor reception for the grocery chain's latest earnings report stemmed from supply-chain pressures and shoplifting that involved organized crime.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, McMullen also predicted 2%-3% inflation for the rest of the year for the company's inputs. He added that the chain can pass most of the costs associated with increased commodities prices to its customers.\n\nKroger shares dropped more than 7% on Friday even though the company reported earnings and revenue that nominally topped expectations.\n\nThe company's margins decreased by 60 basis points, and many investors apparently saw that as their cue to take profits on the stock after KR ran up 24% in the two months heading into the earnings report.\n\nMcMullen told CNBC that half of the margin decline came as a result of disruptions in Kroger's supply chain, which drove up costs. The other half came from a rise in stolen products fueled by an increased prevalence of organized crime.\n\nMcMullen said shoplifting by organized crime has become more prevalent in the past year or two. He added that he has been working with other retailers and law-enforcement authorities to counter the problem.\n\nThe CEO suggested that technology might make it easier for criminals to sell their ill-gotten products, making \"shrinkage\" –  the industry term for merchandise lost to theft –  a bigger problem.\n\n\"In the past, it would have been more flea markets, much harder to sell,\" he said. \"[But] if you look at the current market, it's much easier to sell in the market.\"\n\nKR dropped $3.48 on Friday to close at $42.67. Shares had advanced from early July into last week, when the stock set a closing 52-week high of $47.31. KR also established an intraday 52-week peak of $47.99\n\nhttps://s eekingalpha.com/news/3738842-kroger-ceo-organized-crime-supply-chain-issues-compressed-margins",
