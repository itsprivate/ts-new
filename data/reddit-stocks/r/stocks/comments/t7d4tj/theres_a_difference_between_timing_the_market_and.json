You could say, hey, VOO is only yielding 1.4% in dividends, I'm not sure that's really worth it.  But then you take interest rates into consideration, and then maybe you say, well, that's actually fair, then.  Great!  But what's happening now is that interest rates are going to be going up.  You have to adjust your notion of what's fair.  That's not \"timing the market\".  That's sound fundamental analysis.\n\nThe same people who use the phrase \"don't time the market\" to throw valuation out the window (whether of companies or indices) are the same people who would say \"don't time the market\" in real estate from 2000-2006.  Funny that nobody recommends timing the market, but if that baby's going up, suddenly the trend line is more important than fundamentals.\n\nFor some indicators, see here: [https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/).
