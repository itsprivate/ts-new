From what I understand from it, in the new upcoming Apple IOS update they are turning off the option for Facebook to be able to access your data as default. Which means you now have to give Facebook permission to access your data. Thats what I gathered from this. I could be totally wrong on the interpretation. In my personal opinion I think Apple is in the right of the situation. I don’t use Facebook so why should Facebook be able to access my data freely. I am a investor in Apple but not in Facebook.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
