Right when it was about to acquire i think AMD was about 140B, but at its peak it was alot more than that, without accounting for share change the price was $150ish and so its now worth less than before it acquired it. So basically theyre value it like AMD has no growth and the acquisition is not going to help out at all. this probably one of the most promising growth story there is, because i dont see any other large M&amp;A as big as this. I remember the stock even went up when they announced the news it was doing the M&amp;A. now people forget it?",
