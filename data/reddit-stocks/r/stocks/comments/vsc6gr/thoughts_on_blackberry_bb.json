I have been lurking for over a year trying to learn the basic principles of the market and have learned a lot from the people kind enough to share their wisdom here.  \n\nI raise this post to talk about Blackberry, the previously failed phone company which has since moved into cyber security and EV software.  \n\nI have my own thoughts on it but I do not want this to seem like an attempt at a pump (or dump) so I will just say that I am curious about their potential but equally skeptical on their future.  \n\nI am trying to initiate a discussion to draw on the vast wealth of knowledge so often shown here to see what peoples assessment of BB actually is and why.  \n\nThe reason for this is I don’t think I have ever seen it discussed on here and I would be interested to see peoples take on it.  \n\nI have done my own DD (or at least what I hope is DD) and would describe myself as neutral.  I am looking for further opinions to supplement my own \n\nThank you in advance and I hope this proves not to be a waste of everyone’s time\n\nEdit: I will say what I have discovered about them as people are starting to ask in the comments.  Forgive me primitive DD I am still a bit of a noob.\n\nI am interested in their future due to the predicted emergence and growth of smart cities.  A lot of their technology and software is catered towards smart cities which I think will likely be adopted by most major advanced civilisations within the next 5-10 years.  In terms of profit, they are only just becoming profitable according to their balance sheet but their revenue does appear to be going in the right direction albeit at a painful pace and their debt has started to reduce.\n\nThey have already secured multiple government contracts in reputation to cyber security and are starting to have their software installed in certain EV’s.\n\nJohn Chen by most accounts is a poor CEO and I think the company could do with fresh leadership.  But I do think they have future potential 5-10 years from now",
