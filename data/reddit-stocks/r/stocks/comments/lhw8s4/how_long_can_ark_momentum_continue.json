Realistically, an ETF should have continued growth over years - mabye 5-10% a year? I’ve been invested in some of the ARK ETFS for 2 months and seen 20% gains already. Is this an effect of this bull market or is Cathie Woods really that great? How light do you guys think this can continue? I’m reluctant to putting a large amount of money into ARK because in 10-20 years time I’m not so sure ARK will be the mammoth it is today - although I’m sure it will still be gaining. Are these ARK ETFs here to stay long term or do you think they will reach the end of their life within 10 years?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
