If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of NVIDIA´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for NVDA´s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I do not own shares in NVIDIA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\n\nFirst let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **45%** of their sales comes from **Gaming**. The **Data Center** makes up around **41%**. Another **8%** comes from **Professional Visualization**. Then there is **3%** from **OEM**, and another **2%** from **Automotive**.\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 9,2%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for NVDA´s stock of **$327 per share**. But because we have to account for **NVDA´s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$311 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith NVDA´s price being at **$326** **per share** right now, it´s kind of fairly valued. That´s why I think buying *heavily* might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see NVDA´s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$868 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. \n\n**What I´ll do.** I believe NVIDIA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not exactly where I would want it to be (I want to include a margin of safety), I will maybe start to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I won´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",
