But it didn’t announce any major deals, something that led many analysts and investors to wonder about its next moves. Berkshire ended the year with a near record amount of cash on hand.

It is a good thing for the U.S. to be producing more of its own oil, Mr. Buffett said. Mr. Munger went further, saying he could hardly think of a more useful industry. \n\n---\n\nPersonally I'm not sure what made OXY or CVX so much more appealing this year than last year or the year before, when they were selling for much less.",
