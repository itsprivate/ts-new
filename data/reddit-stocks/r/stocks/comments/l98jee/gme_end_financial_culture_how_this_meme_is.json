Not only are the videos of youtubers explaining what&#39;s going on increasing exponentially, but the incredible thing is that even influencers and youtubers completely outside the stock and financial game are talking about it.</p>\n\n<p>The consequence of this is that a lot of people are getting informed, they are trying to understand what is happening, why it is happening, and what are the rules and mechanisms that are permitting this situation.</p>\n\n<p>This wave of information is spreading at lightning speed financial concepts that have always remained obscure to most people.</p>\n\n<p>In short, ordinary people are opening their eyes. Financial education, albeit minimal, is beginning to be part of the cultural baggage of young and old alike. And this will have huge consequences in the future.</p>\n\n<p>This meme, and the whole GME situation, is opening the eyes to the world. I could compare it to the boost that the first trips to the moon gave to space engineering, or the boost to Karate gyms after the success of the movie Karate Kid, or the boost to medical culture that the pandemic that&#39;s hitting us is giving.</p>\n\n<p>This, gentlemen, is the major event that is revolutionizing economic culture from the ground up. And each one of you is a part of it. And each one of you will be able, one day, to proudly say &quot;f**k money, that time we were the protagonists&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Be honest: who else would have had such an opportunity to use money as a tool against the powerful market manipulators without GME?</p>\n\n<p>This is why what is happening is not a meme anymore. The world will be different afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr</p>\n\n<p>The GME Affair is changing the world&#39;s financial culture forever. No more financial ignorance, no more &quot;under the mattress&quot; investments. No more underhanded economic power plays.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
