The year-over-year forecast of 7.2% is the highest since 1982 and is up from 7% in December.\n\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, is expected to rise 0.4% in January or 5.9% year-over-year, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a monthly increase of 0.6% in December and a year-over-year pace of 5.5% in the final month of last year.\n\nCPI is key for the markets since inflation is seen as a direct trigger for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, and economists are basing their forecasts for the central bank on how much they think inflation will slow from its rapid pace. The Fed has made clear it will fight inflation, and it is widely expected to raise interest rates multiple times this year, starting with a quarter-point hike in March.\n\n\nEDIT: Link has been updated",
