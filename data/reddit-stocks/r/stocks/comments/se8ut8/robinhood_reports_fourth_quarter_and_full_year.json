The decrease was primarily related to lower trading volumes per user for options and equities and lower interest earnings per user from securities lending due to declines in market rates earned on loaned securities, partially offset by higher trading volumes per user for [redacted]. ARPU for the year decreased 5% to $103, compared with $109 for the year ended December 31, 2020. On a sequential basis, ARPU remained consistent compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2021.\n\n* For the first quarter of 2022, Robinhood anticipates that total net revenues will be less than $340 million, which assumes some incremental improvement in trading volumes versus what we have seen so far. At the top end, this implies a year-over-year revenue decline of 35% compared to the first quarter of 2021, during which we saw outsized revenue performance due to heightened trading activity, particularly relating to certain meme-stocks.\n\nDown ~15% after hours, now below $10 after hitting a high of $85. I can't see this company lasting after the memestock debacle. Thoughts?",
