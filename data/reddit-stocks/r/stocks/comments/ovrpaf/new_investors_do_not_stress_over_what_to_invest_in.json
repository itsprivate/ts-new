I spent hours fretting over:\n\n*Should I choose spy?*\n\n*Wait, this expert says vti is better!*\n\n*Hold up! This guy claims voo + vxus is king!*\n\n*Vt and chill you say?!*\n\n*Wait, what’s the difference between spy and voo?*\n\nYou get the idea…\n\nHere’s the thing. It doesn’t matter which one you choose. There are several variations of “the gold standard of investing” and they are all relatively similar. And here’s the kicker: It is foolish to say one is better than the other, because what does “better” even mean? Does it mean it will perform better? Does it mean it is more diversified and carries less risk? But if it has less risk, it may perform worse in the long run, so is it really better?\n\nThe point here is that **no one knows which version of “investing 101” will end up with the best performance 30 years down the road.** Each classic, index-fund-based choice is likely to perform relatively close to its peers in the long run. It’s not like any of them are going to heavily outperform the other. Just choose one and sleep soundly knowing that your money is safe (long term) and will absolutely grow (long term), somewhere in the 8-10%/year range over 30 years. \n\nI think it’s still great to learn about each option, if you find it interesting. I enjoyed learning about the various options. If you enjoy it, learn it! If you don’t, then just choose ANY of the classic strategies and call it a day. Expect to double your money every 7-10ish years. Don’t stress. Investing is actually one of the easiest things in the world to do. It need not be complex. \n\nRedditors on investing subs are often passionate about which version of index fund investing is “best.” It’s cool. It’s all healthy discussion. But don’t let “stonkboy69_420” stress you out just because he’s convinced VT is king of kings. Became in reality, no one knows which one is king, and the differences between each option will end up being minimal anyway. \n\nOne other tidbit: If you are investing for retirement in a 401k or similar, and just want to choose the “best choice” and “set it and forget it,” consider a target date fund. For example, if you plan on retiring in 2060, choose the fund that is set up for that specific date. It automatically rebalances and gets less risky as you get older and closer to retirement. It’s managed by a robot/algorithm and is a great option for anyone. I use one myself in my 457b.",
