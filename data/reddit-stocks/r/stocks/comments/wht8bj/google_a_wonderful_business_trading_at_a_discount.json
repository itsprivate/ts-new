  "selftext": "  Google (Or Alphabet inc) is a 1.5T market cap company - But I still see growth ahead of it. Here's my DD.\n\nWe all know what Google’s main business is (Google Search), so here’s a quick breakdown of the alternate revenue sources for Q2 2022:\n\nSearch - $39.6B\n\nCloud - $5.8B\n\nYoutube - $6.9B\n\nNetwork - $8.2B\n\nOther - $6.8B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, Google search contributes to over half of Google’s revenue, but revenues from Youtube, Network &amp; Cloud are not insignificant either. Google isn’t falling behind the competition either, using nearly $10B on R&amp;D per quarter. Google search has a massive moat, and as more of the world are getting online, I can not see Google’s search revenue declining. On the other hand, Youtube is eating up more streaming viewers from twitch, while Tiktok poses tough competition in the Youtube ‘shorts’ section. I still believe Youtube to be the premium video content platform. Google cloud has a roughly 10% market share in a fast-growing industry, expected to be worth roughly $83B at the end of 2022. Cloud is the third largest player in this sector, behind AWS (33%) and Azure (22%). Google is constantly innovating to keep its market share, and the moat is not eroding. Because of this, I believe Google is a wonderful business trading at a discount due to market conditions - Here is my estimation of Google’s fair value:\n\nTTM FCF 65.19B\n\nAssumptions \n\n3% FCF growth \n\n8% Discount rate \n\n2% Terminal growth rate \n\n10 years of projection\n\n$184.92 Fair Value \n\n$116.93 Price\n\n38% Discount on Fair Value \n\n\\*Always do your own calculations of fair value, I am not a financial advisor\\*\n\nWhile the P/E (21.3) &amp; P/B (6.0) may be high, making Google not a traditional ‘Value’ Investment, I feel it is fair to pay a small premium for a wonderful business, AKA a fair price for a wonderful business, as opposed to a wonderful price for a fair business. \n\nFor me Google is a long-term hold, as the management team has shown their competence, and I have high conviction in the performance of their products, as well as the business as a whole.\n\nGoogle is also using cash flow in acquisitions, such as buying Mandiant for $5.4B, a cyber security company, as well as buying FitBit for $2.1B, a smartwatch company to further enhance the google suite of products. Fitbit is the 4th biggest company by market share in the wearables industry.\n\nHere are the revenue &amp; earnings growth for the last 5 years: \n\nRevenue:\n\n2016 – 90.27B\n\n2017 – 110.85B \n\n2018 – 136.82B \n\n2019 – 161.86B\n\n2020 – 182.53B\n\n2021 – 257.64B \n\n5 year Revenue CAGR: 23.7% \n\nEarnings Per Share:\n\n2016 – 1.39\n\n2017 – 0.90\n\n2018 – 2.19\n\n2019 – 2.46 \n\n2020 – 2.93 \n\n2021 – 5.61 \n\n5 Year EPS CAGR: 46.1% \n\nGoogle, a 1.54T market cap company, is still growing at 20%+ per year – that is insane. \n\nI firmly believe Google to be a wonderful business, with a lot of growth ahead of it. \n\n\\*This is not financial advice, always do your own research\\* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCrosspost from r/HoldForeverInvesting",
