  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, January 3, 2022**\n\n***Disclaimer: There will be no market recap tomorrow since I will be travelling back to my home after the holidays.***\n\nStocks rose in the first trading session of the year as the three major indexes continued to hover near record-highs, building on the momentum from last week. As has been the case for weeks, market participants continue to digest surging coronavirus Omicron cases\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (SPY), which tracks the performance of the five-hundred largest companies in the US, posted another year of amazing gains, rising roughly 27% in 2021. Within the S&amp;P 500, the energy and real estate sectors outperformed, gaining more than 42% each during the year for these sectors' best annual gains on record.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.58%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.96%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.65%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.29%\n* Tesla (TSLA): +13.53%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.50%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -3.66%\n* AMD: +4.41%\n* Daimler (DMLRY): -17.51%\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin, the five largest components of the S&amp;P 500 (or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google) together returned 37% last year – and now constitute about 23% of the entire index.\n\nKostin said, “In 2022, variables associated with earnings and valuation will determine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index and its underlying constituents. Goldman Sachs now expects the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) to climb roughly 7% in 2022 to end at $510.\n\nAnd indeed, this week investors will be eyeing new economic data including the Labor Department's December jobs report to help show the relative strength of U.S. economic growth in the final weeks of the year, as inflation concerns and labor shortages continued to ripple across the country. Risks around the latest surge of the coronavirus are also weighing, with impacts to the labor market from the Omicron variant potentially set to show in the final monthly jobs report for 2021.\n\nUnfortunately, the highly contagious coronavirus Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly throughout the US and the world. The US seven-day rolling average of cases neared 400,000 on Saturday, by far the highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic and more than double the average registered on Christmas Day, according to the Financial Times data tracker.\n\nFortunately, the data suggests that while more contagious, the Omicron variant is less severe compared to previous strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After gaining more than 2% today, Apple (AAPL) became the first company in history to break the $3 trillion market cap.\n* Construction spending in the U.S. rose at a 0.4% monthly clip in November, the Commerce Department said on Monday. This matched October's rate, which was in turn upwardly revised from the 0.2% monthly increase previously reported.\n* The purchasing manager’s index for the manufacturing sector came in slightly lower than expected, reflecting continued supply-side disruptions. The PMI came in at 57.7, the lowest print in over a year.\n* On Sunday, Tesla (TSLA) reported Q4 deliveries that far exceeded Wall Street estimates, which is only made more impressive when one considers how traditional automakers like Ford, Toyota, and General Motors have slashed production due to the semiconductor shortage.  Tesla delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, far higher than analysts' forecasts of 263,026 vehicles.\n* The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced worldwide sales of semiconductors were $48.8 billion in October 2021, an increase of 24.0% from the October 2020 total of $39.4 billion and 1.1% more than the September 2021 total of $48.3 billion. Additionally, a report from Euler Hermes showed expected semi sales growth of 9% for 2022.\n* A.A. Milne's 1926 book \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" was among the many classic works to lapse into the public domain in the United States. Since Milne's work is no longer protected by copyright, the text can be freely published by any company, while the characters and setting of the book can be adapted by any producer or studio.\n\n“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. *-Walt Disney*",
