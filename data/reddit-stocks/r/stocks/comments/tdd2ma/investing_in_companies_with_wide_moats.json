  "selftext": "The term \"**economic moat**\" was coined by Warren Buffett.\n\nThink about a castle that is surrounded by a deep trench, a moat, filled with water. The moat acts to protect the castle from invaders, and the bigger the moat, the less of a chance attackers have of getting across the moat!\n\nMoats, in the context of investing, allows a company to outearn and fend off its competitors for as long as the moat is intact. Just like a castle, the wider and deeper these moats are, the harder it is for competitors to replicate, the less of a chance they have of seizing market share.\n\nMoat investing is based on a simple concept:\n\n**Invest in companies with sustainable competitive advantages trading at attractive valuations**.\n\nOne of the first steps in implementing this approach is finding companies with a moat. A company’s moat refers to its ability to maintain the competitive advantages that are expected to help it fend off competition and maintain profitability into the future.\n\n# Moat archetypes\n\nWhile Moats come in different shapes and sizes, they can be categorized into **five distinct archetypes** (you can find a more comprehensive explanation with examples in this [VanEck Report](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/morningstar-wide-moat-etf-moat/what-makes-a-moat-white-paper.pdf/)).\n\n1. **Intangible assets** (e.g. SBUX) -  Patents, brands, regulatory licenses and other intangible assets can prevent competitors from duplicating a company’s products, or can allow the company to charge a significant price premium\n2. **Network effects** (e.g. GOOG, MSFT, V) - As more people use a company’s product or service, the value of that product or service increases for both new and existing users\n3. **Switching cost** (e.g. CRM) -  When it would be too expensive or troublesome to switch away from a company’s products, that company often enjoys pricing power\n4. **Low-cost producer** (e.g. WMT) -  Firms with a structural cost advantage can either undercut competitors on price while earning similar margins, or can charge market-level prices while earning relatively high margins\n5. **Natural monopolies** \\-  (e.g. D) When a company serves a market limited in size, new competitors may not have an incentive to enter. Incumbents generate economic profits, but new entrants would cause returns for all players to fall to a level in line with or below the cost of capital\n\n# Key Takeaways:\n\n* A company is a good investment if they **earn and can continue to earn more than what they’re selling for**. The greater the earnings are compared to the price, the better the investment.\n* A moat is a distinct and structural advantage a company has that is difficult to replicate and are what allows a company to earn lots of money. **The stronger the moat, the more money it earns**.\n* The **longer you hold a company** with a strong moat, the **better your return on investment will be**.\n* Identifying a moat is not rocket science — **understand how the company makes money**, **figure out why consumers prefer their products over their competitors**, and cross-reference your hypothesis with a few key numbers.\n* Owner's earnings growth is a good and reliable way to identify if a company has moat. **The wider the moat, the more owner's earnings will grow**.\n\nInterested to hear examples of companies with wide moats in each of these archetypes, so feel free to share in the comments.",
