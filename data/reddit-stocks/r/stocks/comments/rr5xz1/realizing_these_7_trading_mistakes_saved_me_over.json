Even more jarring was the complete crash of Chinese darlings Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com due to concerns that the communist government in China would be, well, communistic. \n\nInstitutional investors used fears of inflation and the latest COVID variant as a reason (excuse) to get out of positions they knew had been overbought. And all the stop losses got triggered thereafter, creating a snowball effect. This has restored some sanity to the market, though I’d argue many stocks are still overvalued.\n\n I’m going to lay out 7 mistakes everyone makes when investing below in the hope that it provides some guidance to those who need it. If you feel you don't need, just don't read it. Thanks.\n\n**Expecting the Market to Rise in a Straight Line**  \n While this seems straightforward, many people believe the stock market only goes up and never down. This is not true. The market goes up 80% of the time BUT not all companies are taken on that ride and you should expect a 10% pullback every other year. \n\nLikewise, the number of smaller pullbacks of 5% have become more common over the past decades and now average around 5 per year. Keep in mind, these pullbacks represent the average of a bundle of 500 stocks, meaning some stocks are affected a lot more than 5% and others less than 5%.\n\n**Not Picking An Entry Point**\n\nThese market pullbacks represent great buying opportunities, but should not be relied on as the entry points because in the moment investors don’t know if it’s a 5, 10, or 20% correction. Instead of trying to predict the future outcome of a pullback, I have a set list of companies I want to buy always ready to go with my target price.\n\nThink of this list as your budget - you determine this entry price and you don’t budge from that target. If the stock drops to the price or below, it’s a buy, and you enter the trade. I may lose more money on the way further down but that’s OK, I got my entry price and need to have faith in the investment rebounding. I have gotten burned more times than I care to count by getting impatient and buying a stock above my target price only to watch in horror as it tumbles back down to the price I wanted to pay to begin with six months later.\n\nTruth be told, this is more a game of patience and good technology. I set price alerts using Fidelity (always to my phone not email) and I try to ignore the FOMO as the stock rides up high quickly.\n\nBeing a successful investor is a lot like being on a diet at all times. I’m constantly hungry for more, wanting to jump in an enjoy decadent treats, and having to sacrifice my desires for better outcomes. If I’m not feeling the friction of personal restraint, I’m not investing, I’m just gambling.\n\n**Setting Entry Prices Based on Graphs Only**\n\nOK, so I need to set an entry point to avoid being the bag holder - how do I do that? There are many ways. The worst way IMHO is to look at a chart and pick a number based on where a stock has been previously aka a previous dip. Technical analysts will often point to support and resistance lines in graphs and talk  about whether or not a stock will hold its fall at a resistance point or break out through a previous resistance line. \n\nNew support and resistance lines are forming all of the time because of the micro and macro environments. Said plainly, events cause these levels - they are not mystical levels that form on their own. People react to events and prices change. And many levels are created by people in support of their own thesis these lines exist, self-perpetuating their existence. Usually, they are formed around events. The events could be company news or it could be macro news about the inflationary environment, policy changes, or other world events. So it’s critical to track events and know what’s going on with the company and the world before going in. You can do this through the news or by using technology.\n\nI use a software system to keep track of major company events and help me understand how they will impact the price movement. I haven’t found a more efficient way of doing that.\n\nIf you’ve taken account of events, the next thing to do is find a way to value the stock. There are many ways to do this and I plan on writing a post with more detail on that in the near future. For now, I’ll note a few simple ways to do this.\n\n**Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)** \\- the P/E ratio gives an analysis of the stock’s price relative to its annual earnings or profit. The higher the P/E, the more expensive the stock. The easiest way to understand this is to think about your investment as the share price and the annual return on that investment as the earnings. If the P/E is 20, it would take you 20 years to recoup your investment in terms of the value of those earnings. This ignores a lot of things like inflation, free cash flow, the total assets of the company, company debt, and how fast the company is growing. But it’s a useful back of envelope way to give an idea about whether the investment may turn out well. If a stock has a P/E above 20, the company should be growing double digits annually, not be riddled with debt, and have competitive positioning so it doesn’t get crushed. If it’s trading over 60 P/E, it should be growing earnings and revenue triple digits to justify the valuation, or be in a position to dominate a market for many years to come.\n\nOther valuations include the Price to Book ratio, the Price to Sales Ratio, and the Enterprise Value to EBIDTA. We’ll have to cover these in another post. For now, know they exist but you can use the P/E as a north star to guide your entry points and avoid overpaying for stocks. In an environment of low inflation, P/E matters less than it does than in an environment of higher inflation, where companies with less earnings and cash flow have to borrow more at higher interest rates to continue growing.\n\nSo set your entry price on a reasonable P/E ratio that is in line with the historical 5-year P/E of the company and its peers (Fidelity makes this readily available). If you buy a company with no earnings, it’s going to get crushed every time there’s an inflationary scare because in order to grow, that company has to borrow money or raise more money by selling more shares or debt, which dilutes the company’s value. Likewise, if their high growth stalls for even one quarter, the stock will go into free fall. So you need to monitor earnings results very closely if you own one of these stocks.\n\n**Creating a Portfolio That is High Risk**\n\nIf I had a hundred dollars for each time someone asked my opinion about Nio, PlugPower, or Docusign, I’d be able to pay a full year’s college tuition. Yea, these stocks have done very well until now. But they are volatile stocks all based on the premise of future domination with little evidence to back that up today. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE growth stocks. But they should compose a portion of a portfolio, not the whole pizza.\n\nI allocate 20% of my portfolio to growth stocks and that’s pretty high, but I’m willing to lose over half of that for the longer term gains. I would never be 100% growth stocks as that is an easy way to experience immense pain as these stocks are likely to crash heavily as we’ve seen recently. And I buy and sell these stocks - I don’t hold them forever.\n\nThere are far better experts than I at creating the killer portfolio allocation, but my advice is to carve it up into stable dividend payers like Verizon, large cap leaders in tech like Apple, large cap healthcare companies (I like Anthem), large cap payments companies like Visa and Mastercard, strong value mid-cap companies like my favorite: Crocs, some consumer staples stocks that people need even when things are bad, some semi-conductors that aren’t overpriced, and companies leading in new industries that actually make money. \n\n**Buying At The Peak Price**\n\nIf you’ve ever bought at the peak, the following scenario should sound familiar: An event happens, the stock you’ve been hearing about all year, which is up 100%, rallies 13% today and another 15% the next day. Analysts up their price targets, the news is buzzing that the company is unstoppable, and days later the stock is up another 50%. You’ve heard about this company for a long time and have wanted to buy it but waited. Everyone you know owns it, brags about their gains, and it looks like it’s making another unstoppable, huge run. Not wanting to be left on the sidelines missing out again, you throw some money at the stock, buying at its peak. A week later, UBS calls the stock’s valuation detached from reality and lowers its price target, sending the stock down 15%. In the days that follow, it continues to sink, with analysts downgrading their estimates. Then they miss their earnings target, and the stock plummets further. You’re unsure what to do, so you do nothing and watch your losses pile up. You are the bag holder.\n\nIf the description above sounds uncomfortably familiar, don’t fret: you’re not alone. We’ve all been there. The only thing to do is to learn from the events and take the lesson that it’s very risky to buy at the peak, where a peak can be defined as the point at which everyone knows about it, is talking about it, and has already invested in it. If you come in after, you’re taking on more risk than the possible reward. So what should you do when you want to own that stock? Wait. Set a reasonable entry point and wait. You might have to wait 9 months. Women do this for children all the time while being wildly uncomfortable. You can handle not buying a stock for 9 months.\n\nThere is another way to play it that’s more complicated: you could pick a price that is a little above your entry point and sell a put. That gives someone else the right to sell the stock to you at that price and in return you collect the premium for the contract. If the stock you want is trading at 300 and the price you want to pay is 200, sell a $30 put at 230. If the stock never comes down, you make $30 a share, and you have profited from the stock. Congrats! If it does come down under 230 and the contract is exercised, you end up buying the stock at 230 but pocket a $30 premium, making your net purchase price 200 - just the price you wanted! Win win.\n\n**Losing Faith &amp; Conviction**\n\nAfter taking a beating on a stock or ten, it’s easy to lose faith in your abilities to make sound investments and even easier to lose conviction in your other stock purchases. It’s these moments where you need to remind yourself that the market goes up AND down and you will have many more years to make money (if you’re healthy) provided you learn from your mistakes and continue trying.\n\nI write down everything I’ve learned in a list that I revisit time and time again. This list is now 30 points strong on what not to do based on 30 ways I’ve lost money. It’s now a list of how to make money in the stock market (and how to populate blog content).\n\nIf you write down what went wrong, you’re committing to lifelong learning and to be improving. If you don’t and opt to wallow in self-pity, you’re bound to not only repeat these mistakes, but you’re likely to sit out on future market rallies because you lack conviction. The best buying opportunities comes when market participants feel powerless and are willing to sell their stock at steep discounts.\n\n“When there’s blood on the streets, buy property.”\n\n**Not Having an Exit Plan**\n\nHow much money do you want to make on your investment? The answer can’t be infinity and I don’t know isn’t much better. Professional wealth managers aim for 6% a year, net of fees. The S&amp;P 500 returned an average of 7.5% over the past 20 years.\n\nSo what will I do if a stock I own goes up 300% in one year? I sell it and wait for an opportunity to buy it again when it comes back down to earth. Why? Because I’ve accomplished the returns I’m looking for. I sell it because I reached my exit price, even if that happens a lot faster than I thought it was going to because my goal is to make money not to own stocks.\n\nSome stocks *are* long holds. Visa, Apple, Microsoft, Google - it’s ok not to have a lifetime price target on these. For others less established, I like to have a goal. I bought Lemonade stock at $44 for example. When I bought it pre-IPO, I thought it was a 10X stock over 10 years. In the first year, the stock skyrocketed to 175. It was too much too fast for the trajectory I was expecting so I sold some at 80 and the rest at 120. Making 2 x and 3x my money in one year reached my goal of 10X return over 10 years in terms of the annual return, so I was out. I also thought the valuation was not justified. Others agree, and the stock is back at $44 now. If I had bought and held, I would have achieved no profit. Instead, I grossed $50,000 on a $20,000 investment.\n\nIn case you’re curious, I do plan to buy Lemonade again IF they can prove they are able to gross more revenue per existing client. Right now they are paying too much for customer acquisition.\n\nJust remember to take taxes into account when determining your profit targets. In my case, I held LMND for a year prior to selling, so I paid capital gains taxes not income tax rates.\n\nGood luck.",
