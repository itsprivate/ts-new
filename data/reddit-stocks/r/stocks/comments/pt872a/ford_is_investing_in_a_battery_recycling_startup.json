The company is investing in battery recycling start-up Redwood Materials, which is run by Tesla (ticker: TSLA) co-founder J.B. Straubel. The two companies are working to create a closed-loop recycling chain for lithium ion batteries. Cars, of course, are recycled, and investors know about scrap steel prices and scrapyards. But traditional cars have been on roads for generations. EVs are relatively new, and there are only about 2 million on U.S. roads—out of roughly 276 million vehicles. And because new EVs likely won’t be scrapped for years, battery recycling is just in its infancy.\n\n“Ford is making electric vehicles more accessible and affordable through products like the all electric F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit, and much more to come,” said Ford CEO Jim Farley in the company’s news release. “Our partnership with Redwood Materials will be critical to our plan to build electric vehicles at scale in America, at the lowest possible cost and with a zero waste approach.”\n\nFord is investing $50 million in Redwood to “expand Redwood’s manufacturing footprint.” Ford plans to invest $30 billion between now and 2025 developing EVs and building its own battery capacity with partners. Redwood has plans to be more than a battery recycler. Eventually, it wants to be a battery materials company, potentially producing battery raw materials—which are typically produced in northeast Asia—in the U.S.\n\nRedwood isn’t publicly traded. But Li-Cycle (LICY) is a battery recycler that recently became publicly traded via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Li-Cycle stock jumped about 4% in premarket trading, far above the roughly 0.5% gain for both S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/ford-motor-stock-redwood-materials-ev-battery-51632318687?mod=markets](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/ford-motor-stock-redwood-materials-ev-battery-51632318687?mod=markets)",
