In addition to structurally lower interest rates, the last 12 years were also an environment with effectively infinite QE.\n\nThis low inflation, QE supported environment is likely a huge reason why US tech stocks were able to dominate and have outsized returns starting in 2009-10. Money was effectively free, making it easier to grow a business without needing to show immediate profits. This is largely what created the environment to support a Tech boom and higher P/E's.\n\nBut as we know, the top 10 companies of today are unlikely to be the top 10 companies in 10 years from now.\n\nWith the macro environment now shifting away from unlimited QE and a breakdown of globalization, there's a lot of talk of a regime change. I don't have the words for how important this could be for equity investors. A regime change is not a \"good\" thing (at least in the short term), and it could very well lead to a world of structurally higher interest rates, the end of QE, and ultimately, a change in investor perceptions.\n\nIf this regime change does happen (and we are seeing the beginning of it), and QE goes away for the next 40 years and interest rates \"normalize\" to 5%+ as they used to be before the 08 financial crisis, I'm wondering what that will mean for investors.\n\nWhy buy a stock at a 20+ P/E when you could buy a Bond that pays 5%+ guaranteed? All of a sudden, the average P/E we've been accustomed to for the last decade+ is completely  unsustainable. An example of this, during the inflationary bear market in the 70's, the stock market got down to P/E's below 10x. Could you imagine what would happen to SPY if it went to a P/E of 10? People would say it's the end of the world and investing is dead. I don't anticipate this will happen, I'm just putting into context what higher interest rates for longer will do to stocks, and the higher interest rates get, the lower P/E's have to go.\n\nSo, if we are going through a regime change due to higher for longer inflation, and the last 40 years of low interest rates is over, what happens to equity valuations, and does it still make sense to index to something like the S&amp;P?\n\nWould it make more sense to Index specifically to cash flowing dividend payers that are already priced below 15x P/E on average? When there's a real cost of capital and money is no longer \"free\", it seems to me that investors will prefer return of capital rather than return on capital.\n\nThe idea of a regime change away from structurally low interest rates could make stock market investing extremely unattractive, and the fact that broad market ETF's have become such a crowded trade over the last 2 decades, in addition to the macro environment we had, it just makes me think indexing won't be the free lunch it used to be.\n\nThat doesn't mean I think we should all become stock pickers or bond investors. But, it does make me think that the way ETF's are currently structured (with high P/E Tech being the biggest weighting), returns will be severely muted going forward.\n\nAll of this of course is speculation on the idea that we are going through a regime change, and interest rates will \"never\" be as low as we've seen them recently. It's easy for people to anchor to what the world used to be (we saw this when Covid happened, people thought we were just a 1-2 week lockdown away from the world going back to normal, but it never did.)\n\nI find it difficult to believe one day everything will just go back to 0% interest rates and markets will continue to grind up like nothing ever happened. I find it much more likely that interest rates are higher for longer, and investors start to prefer different types of equities than the ones we've seen over the last 20 years, which ultimately could lead to broad market ETF's being a \"dead\" investment for a long time, at least until a new group of \"leaders\" emerges like the FAANG stocks.",
