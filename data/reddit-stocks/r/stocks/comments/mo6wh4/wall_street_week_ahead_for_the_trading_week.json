I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Earning season is about to get underway and that could be a positive catalyst for stocks - <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/earning-season-is-about-to-get-underway-and-that-could-be-a-positive-catalyst-for-stocks.html\">(Source)</a></strong></h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead, and it is expected to be a positive catalyst that could continue to send stocks higher for now.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The Dow and S&amp;P 500 start the week at record highs after a strong rally Friday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The coming week is packed with Federal Reserve speakers and important data, including a much anticipated inflation reading Tuesday, when the consumer price index is released. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell kicks off another busy week for Fed appearances with a Sunday evening interview on “60 Minutes.” He also speaks Wednesday at an Economic Club of Washington event.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Powell, in comments this past week, continued to reinforce that the Fed will keep its easy policies in place for a long time, and that any emergence of inflation should be temporary. But hotter-than-expected producer price inflation data Friday has made the consumer price index release Tuesday all the more important. PPI gained 1%, double the expected increase.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said he expects core CPI to rise 0.2% for March, or 1.5% year-over-year, but headline inflation should rise 0.5% or 2.5% year-over-year. Cummins said March is the beginning of a period where inflation could appear greater, just because of the comparison to low levels last year when the economy was shut down.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“I think the Fed has already moved ahead of it,” Cummins said. He expects CPI to peak at 3.6% in May but then calm down during the summer.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The other key piece of data in the coming week is the retail sales report for March, which Cummins said could show a 10% gain. The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 5.6% gain, following a 3% decline in February.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Cummins said March sales should be boosted by the $1,400 stimulus checks sent to individuals, which started reaching bank accounts in mid-March. More of the economy has also been opening up, as more people get vaccinated.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“The back end of the month should be very strong,” he said. “If you look at auto sales, that was the highest level in four years. It seems like restaurants are getting more crowded, with outdoor seating.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Earnings season</h1>\n\n<p>But it may be the earnings season that is the real tell for the economy.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“It isn’t what they report,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “For the first time, we are going to hear more and more companies now actually making comments about the future. Are they going to upwardly revise some of their outlooks or are they not? That’s what’s really going to be key about it.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The big banks kick off the reporting Wednesday, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Bank of America and Citigroup report Thursday. Morgan Stanley reports Friday. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines are also among the first to report.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“The consensus for the first quarter is earnings are supposed to be up roughly 22%. We have an easy comp from last year. That number could be closer to 30%,” said Brian Rauscher, head of global portfolio strategy at Fundstrat.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Rauscher said he expects the most earnings beats to be in the cyclical sectors, like consumer discretionary, financials and materials, all sectors that benefit from the reopening economy.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“I think earnings season is going to be constructive, and it’s going to be good enough to keep the market going higher,” he said.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Based on estimates and early reports, Refinitiv now expects earnings growth of 25% for the first quarter. Companies have been beating estimates so far at a pace of 81%. Earnings for the financial sector are expected to be up 76%. The consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by shutdowns a year ago, and its earnings are expected to bounce back by 98%, according to Refinitiv.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“I think what we’re going to start to see is the operating leverage for these companies is really underappreciated. The earnings are going to start to come back faster than the revenues,” said Rauscher. “Corporate America has really done a good job in the last year of streamlining their operations, their cost structures and everything else. Revenues could come back 50%, and earnings could come back 100%.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The major stock market indices were higher in the past week, but small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 losing ground. The Dow rose nearly 2% for the week, ending at a record 33,800, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.7% to a record 4,128. The Nasdaq was the leader, gaining 3.1% to 13,900. The Russell was down a half percent at 2,243.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stayed in the mid zone of its recent range. On Friday afternoon, it was at 1.65%, well below its recent high of 1.77%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><strong>This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/SsNKd5t.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7PxjyGO.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/BGn3mdX.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Futures Markets as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ucOV16J.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZcDexnu.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hs3rgqt.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/D84TrTx.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/HSpBbEE.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JGKdm0f.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/I3hQau1.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Here are the upcoming IPO&#39;s for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/jd1CmAU.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Friday&#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/KBXlmf7.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/M9IZaVr.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/IGlLCbW.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>As Close to a Perfect Year For Equities as You Can Get</h1>\n\n<p>Every day in our Morning Lineup, we provide a technical snapshot of the market looking at various metrics. One chart we show is the relative strength of stocks (S&amp;P 500) versus bonds (US Treasury Long Bond Future) over the trailing 12 months (chart below). Whenever the line is in the green area, it indicates that stocks are outperforming bonds relative to the start date, while readings in the red zone indicate bonds outperforming stocks. What stood out about the chart in this morning&#39;s report was the fact that relative to one year ago (4/1 close), stocks have been outperforming bonds every day since. Sure, there have been periods in between where bonds outperformed stocks (falling line), but from a longer-term perspective, it has been about as perfect a year for stocks relative to bonds as you could imagine.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Bonds-vs-Stocks.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>The chart below shows the performance of both asset classes individually over the last year. If you think the divide between political parties in the US has ripped wider, it has nothing on the growing divide between stocks and bonds. While the S&amp;P 500 is up over 50%, the US Treasury Long Bond Future is down 14%. If we had to bet on which divide will start to narrow sooner, is there anything closer to a sure thing than taking the stock vs bond divide over the Democrat vs Republican divide?</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Stocks-and-Bonds.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Blowout Q1 Harbinger For More Gains</h1>\n\n<p>Well-above average Q1 gains for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 bode well for continued gains in 2021. DJIA’s 2021 Q1 gain of 7.8% is significantly higher than its historical average of 2.0% and the 17th best Q1 gain since 1949. S&amp;P’s 5.8% gain was also substantially higher than its average of 2.1% and the 19th best since 1949. NASDAQ was the laggard up only 2.8% in Q1 this year, which is actually below its average of 4.1% since 1971 and the 28th best since 1971.</p>\n\n<p>In any event positive Q1 returns have been a harbinger for continued market gains for the year as whole. As you would imagine, subsequent Q2 and Q3 returns during the Worst Six Months are not as strong as Q4 at the outset of the Best Six Months. As you can see in the tables below, Q2 and Q3 post positive average numbers, but returns are lower than Q1 and Q4 and there are more losers.</p>\n\n<p>Further gains for the year as a whole failed materialized for DJIA in 1956, 1971, 1979, 1981 1987, 2002, 2011 and 2012 with lackluster performance for the remainder of the year in 1976 and 1992. S&amp;P failed to produce additional gains in 1956, 1981 1987, 2000, 2011 and 2015 with weak gains for the rest of 1971, 1986 and 2012. NASDAQ failed to add to Q1 gains in 1974, 1981, 1986, 1987, 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2018 with paltry showings for balance of 1975, 1983, 1988, 2006 and 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Overall positive returns for Q1 resulted in full-year gains for: DJIA 40 out of the last 42 times with an average gain of 16.4% (median 16.3%); S&amp;P 41 out of 45 times with an average return of 16.4% (median 15.6%), and NASDAQ 28 of 34 with an average gain of 18.9% (median 17.0%).</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/50307cca0bb95baca38fd6c91ea3345d/9fd682449cdaab61-24/s640x960/7bb498d3f99669e09cd0dfb1cbf7343b7b7c0282.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/dca086c6e79aace768209005887d3bdb/9fd682449cdaab61-4b/s640x960/006e88dfccaa2434d2d637b047a7fa54994b2b5e.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2d386a4603e3176179127ee1f420309/9fd682449cdaab61-c8/s500x750/9a14c5198f1105963337ba87a0b6a61239bf4b0d.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>LPL Market Signals: Raising Economic and Market Forecasts…Again</h1>\n\n<p>On the LPL Market Signals podcast, Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder and Asset Allocation Strategist Barry Gilbert update forecasts based on how the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, aided by vaccine distribution, massive stimulus, and the desire to return to normal, continues to surpass expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Strong March jobs report. The US labor market grew the most in seven months in March, as the economy added 916,000 jobs, trouncing the median economists’ estimate for a 660,000 gain (source: Bloomberg). Segments of the labor market most dependent on in-person interaction saw the greatest gains, notably hospitality and leisure. We expect to see bigger job gains in the coming months, potentially over one million per month into the summer, helping to close the gap on the more than eight million jobs still needed to get back to the pre-pandemic peak.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a></strong></h6>\n\n<p><strong>Raising U.S. and global economic growth forecasts.</strong> An accelerating vaccine rollout, American’s desire to resume somewhat normal lives, and massive stimulus set the stage for booming growth in the U.S. economy this year. Our 2021 U.S. GDP growth forecast goes from 5—5.5% to 6.25—6.75%. A stronger U.S. growth outlook pushes LPL Research’s expectations for growth in emerging markets and globally higher as well.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a></strong></h6>\n\n<p><strong>Raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate.</strong> With more economic growth comes more revenue opportunities for corporate America.

We are leaving our year-end fair value target for the S&amp;P 500 Index unchanged at 4,050—4,100 for now in anticipation of lower stock valuations as interest rates rise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Raising our year-end target range for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield.</strong> Stronger economic growth and more stimulus spending may put further upward pressure on yields. We have raised our forecast for the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.25—1.75% to 1.75—2.00%.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a></strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Global Growth Expectations on the Rise</h1>\n\n<p>Before the pandemic we had begun to warm up to international stocks. Valuations relative to the U.S. markets had become increasingly attractive after a long stretch of outperformance by U.S. stocks compared with those in Europe and Japan. We had also anticipated that a weaker U.S. dollar would enhance international stock returns for U.S.-based investors.</p>\n\n<p>Then the pandemic hit. Since then we have maintained our preference for U.S. stocks over their developed international counterparts. In 2020 the U.S. market benefited from its heavy concentration in technology, digital media, and e-commerce stocks that are well positioned for the stay-at-home and work-from-home environment. More recently, as the Eurozone has struggled to contain COVID-19, our conviction in our U.S. preference has increased.</p>\n\n<p>“As the end of the pandemic has come closer into view and value stocks do better in anticipation of a full reopening, the environment should theoretically be better for international stocks,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “But the global dominance of the U.S. market has continued in 2021, in part due to sluggish vaccine distribution in Europe, and LPL Research continues to favor U.S. stocks over those in Europe and Japan.”</p>\n\n<p>A look at consensus expectations for economic growth around the world supports our preference for the U.S. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, not only is gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. expected to outpace Europe, the UK, Japan, and the broad emerging markets this year, but the U.S. has also seen the biggest increase in consensus expectations for GDP growth year to date—an increase of 1.9 percentage points to near 6% (source Bloomberg). Earlier this week we upgraded our U.S. GDP growth forecasts for 2021 to 6.25%—6.75%, while maintaining our growth forecast for developed international economies at 3.75%—4.25%.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-CHart-1.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>The reopening of the U.S. economy amid the accelerating pace of vaccine distribution is certainly a big driver of the increase in growth expectations this year. But massive fiscal stimulus—now over $5 trillion—is another key part of the story.</p>\n\n<p>The chart below illustrates how massive this stimulus is relative to the size of the U.S. economy (about 26%), and also how much larger it has been than the response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009. While U.S. stimulus is comparable in size to Europe’s, U.S. stimulus has included more direct payments and spending, and therefore has been more impactful than stimulus in Europe, which has included more loan guarantees.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>We continue to recommend investors focus their regional tactical allocations on the U.S. and underweight developed international equities. We also recommend a modest allocation to emerging market equities, where suitable, to take advantage of a strong economic growth outlook and attractive valuations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>A Goldilocks First Quarter Has Bulls Smiling</h1>\n\n<p>Stocks have kicked off the year in a strong fashion, and history shows this may give reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. After a solid—but certainly turbulent—year in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index has continued to set new all-time highs in 2021, returning 5.8% in the first quarter.</p>\n\n<p>“Momentum breeds momentum, but you may not want too much of it,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Hitting singles and doubles has historically been the sweet spot for first quarter returns.”</p>\n\n<p>As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns between 5-10% have been the “Goldilocks” level in the first quarter, with an average return of 12.4% through the rest of the year.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/revised-blog.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Returns through the rest of the year have historically been the worst when the S&amp;P 500 is negative in the first quarter, averaging just 3.1%. However, too much momentum in the first quarter may not be ideal, either. When the S&amp;P 500 has returned more than 10% in the first quarter, returns through the rest of the year have averaged 6.5%.</p>\n\n<p>1987 is a year that is often referred to as the year of the “blow-off top,” as the S&amp;P 500 returned over 40% through its peak in August, with over a 20% return in the first quarter alone. This was the only year with a first quarter return greater than 10% that was negative through the rest of the year, but removing 1987 from the data only raises the average to 8.7%, not enough to beat the 5-10% return group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish</h1>\n\n<p>Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. April ranks #2 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.91% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.30% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is just as strong over the recent 21-year period.</p>\n\n<p>Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off around the seventh trading day. At which point, there is just a hint of weakness heading into mid-month. Then the market tends to resume its charge higher through month’s end.
