  "selftext": "Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a research report that Nvidia ([NVDA](https://NVDA.US)) shares have been sold off recently due to concerns about slowing growth, but the sell-off appears to be overdone.\n\nArya said Nvidia shares fell sharply last week, likely due to concerns about its gaming business, which has also sent the stock down 26% so far this year. Arya speculates that market concerns may stem from the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict that may dampen demand for European customers, Chinese customers may be affected by the epidemic blockade measures, and cryptocurrency-related customers may be affected by the falling price of Ethereum and the POS consensus mechanism (representing Ethereum Blockchain security will transition from expensive power-hungry mining hardware to relying on staking tokens) resulting in reduced demand for graphics cards.\n\n\"While we point to these headwinds, we believe investors may be underestimating other supporting trends, including: strength in data centers, the Pro Viz platform and the automotive business in the second half,\" the analyst added, based on Hopper-structured gaming products and inventory replenishment will also boost the stock.\n\nArya pointed out that if Nvidia's gaming business were to decline, it would only have a 7%-9% impact on earnings per share. The analyst lays out a scenario for this, expecting Nvidia’s earnings per share to decline by 5% sequentially in the current quarter and 10% in the next quarter. \"It's worth noting that Nvidia's gaming business sales grow by an average of 25% every two years (a CAGR of 8% to 45%), while the above scenario assumes a two-year CAGR of only 25%,\" Arya wrote. 6%, well below the historical range.\"\n\nIn the end, Arya concluded: \"Considering that Nvidia is increasing sales in the high barrier computing market at a CAGR of 20-25% (3 times the growth of the semiconductor industry) in the high barrier computing market, while maintaining more than 45% Industry-leading EBIT and we continue to view Nvidia as one of the most important growth companies in the semiconductor space, even in technology.” Currently, the analyst has a “buy” rating on Nvidia with a price target of 375 Dollar.",
