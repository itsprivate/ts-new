He added that Tesla should use its free cash flow to fund the buyback and should not affect its existing $18 billion cash hoard.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Koguan said Tesla had free cash flow of $2.2 billion in the first quarter of this year. He added that after accounting for capital spending, he expects it to climb to $8 billion this year and $17 billion next year.\n\nTesla shares closed down more than 6 percent on Wednesday amid a broad market sell-off. The company's shares have fallen more than 30% this year.
