Don't DCA. Just dump it in the stock market that day and that approach will have been better than DCA 68% of the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Analysis:**\n\nI've seen a lot of people talk about the benefits of [dollar cost averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) (DCA). I was one of them. So I put it to the test. Using the SP500 at-open data (Thank you [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/)), I compared the results of dollar cost averaging vs. lump sum investing.\n\nFor every single market day from 2007 to 2019, I compared the performance of a lump sum investment vs. DCA every week for 12 months and looked at the 2-year return from the initial investment date to calculate ROI. I then aggregated the results and came up with a few heuristics to help summarize the findings.\n\nI'm also pretty skeptical of the current market conditions. We're at an All-Time-High (ATH) and I assumed in ATH markets, deferring some of your investments through DCA might yield better results since corrections are more likely in the short-term.\n\nWhat I found was:\n\n* Lump sum investing yielded better results 68% of the time, and on average returned 4.1% more on your investment than DCA\n* Investing in non-ATH markets yielded better results (shocking... /s).\n* Surprisingly (still checking the script and data to validate), you had a higher rate of losing 10%+ of your investment through DCA than Lump Sum indicating Lump Sum would be safer which I am still validating because I just don't buy it. I don't think there's anything wrong with the script but triple and quadruple checking to be sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Validate the output of the script again to triple check results\n* Apply statistical significance measures to the analysis to validate the pvalues are in an appropriate range.\n* Run the analysis on a bundle of individual stocks where volatility is higher than a broad index to see if that changes anything.\n* Run the analysis for periods in the 70s, 80s, 90s to see how things change\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|ATH Flag|All Years|ATH|Not ATH|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total Inputs|2652|2029|623|\n|Lump Win Pct|68.4%|68.4%|68.5%|\n|Lump Return Over DCA Pct|4.1%|4.0%|4.3%|\n|||||\n|Lump Avg. ROI|19.9%|18.1%|25.6%|\n|DCA Avg. ROI|15.2%|13.6%|20.4%|\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe analysis was done using Python in VSCode. Some specifics about the analysis for those interested in the methodology.\n\n* Every market day, I compared investing 100% of the funds vs. investing an equal proportion of those funds every week over 52 weeks.\n* I then looked at the market price 2 years into the future for that market to calculate ROI\n* If, in 2 years, that day ended up on a weekend I looked for the next Monday\n* To determine if market was at an ATH for each investment date, I looked at the max price over the last 60 days and compared that to the max price of the previous 3 years. If the max price of in the last 60 days was >= 95% of the ATH of the previous 3 years, I would flag that day as \"Yes - ATH\". Otherwise it would fall back into the \"No - ATH\" bucket.",
