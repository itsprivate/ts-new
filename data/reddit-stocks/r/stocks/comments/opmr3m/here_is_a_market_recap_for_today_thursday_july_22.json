  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 22, 2021**\n\nStocks edged higher today in a very volatile session, with the three main indexes (S&P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), Dow Jones (DIA) falling at open before reversing to the upside mid-session, a sign that market participants remain eager to buy up any dip. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its two day rally, trading 1.75% lower at the time of writing. Market participants continue to weight a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.\n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings season continues full steam ahead, with the quarter shaping up to be another record-setting one. Earnings are expected to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers as the economy reopens. While concerns around the delta variant have put a damper on sentiment, reports by companies have not reflected any slowdown in growth. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat (SNAP) skyrocketed after-hours after the companies reported better than expected earnings and raised guidance moving forward.\n* Shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) skyrocketed after smashing earnings estimates and announcing a new share buyback program\n* US Senators introduced a bill that would amend Section 230, the well-known law that gives social media companies immunity from what users post on their platform, to hold companies liable for health-related misinformation.\n* Websites of several airlines, banks and technology companies, including Amazon's AWS, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Express (AXP), were facing outages, according to DownDetector. So far, I’ve been unable to find the cause.\n* Bank of America (BAC) on Wednesday said its board approved a 17% increase to the company's quarterly cash dividend.\n* U antitrust regulators are set to give unconditional approval to Irish aircraft leasing company AerCap's (AER) $30 billion bid for General Electric's (GE) aircraft leasing business, three people familiar with the matter said.\n* Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year. At first, there will be a safety driver behind the wheel but reportedly want fully automated robotaxis by 2022 or 2023.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Ally Financial (ALLY) target raised by Citigroup from $59 to $63 at Buy.
