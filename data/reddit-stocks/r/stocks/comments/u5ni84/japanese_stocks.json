I know this is not the only indicator of fair price evaluation but it seems that the American stocks are all overpriced for multiple reasons more than just high PE. Can anyone make an argument on why Japanese stocks will/will not grow in the next 5-10 years. People have discussed Japan’s work ethic as being unmatched in the world so I imagine this will be a factor in quality products and services. Also, if there are bullish claims out there are there any stocks you are specifically excited about? Thanks for taking the time to read this. Any advice is welcome.",
