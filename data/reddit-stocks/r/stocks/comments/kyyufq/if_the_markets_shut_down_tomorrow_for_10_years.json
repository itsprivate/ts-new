He&#39;s consistently preached about investing in good companies with great management or investing in within your circle of competence. Sure, he&#39;s missed out on the tech boom, but results are results. His teachings span across all generations and his quirky teachings make investing seem so simple. </p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re now in an environment that many say is a bubble (though that&#39;s been the case for 20 years), uncertainty about the FED artificially inflating the price of stocks, and an army of young investors YOLOing it all on garbage companies, perhaps exploiting how easily the market can be manipulated. But for Buffett, the dude just grabs his McDonalds sandwich each morning, heads to work, sucks down a Coke, and reads for like 8 hours...completely ignoring all the noise. Why? He&#39;s invested in good companies with good management. </p>\n\n<p>So assuming you could only invest in 6 stocks, (1 of which is completely speculative just for fun) and TOMORROW the markets shut down for 10 years, which companies would you invest in TODAY?</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s my list in the order from highest to lowest portfolio %</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Google</li>\n<li>Disney</li>\n<li>Amazon</li>\n<li>AT&amp;T</li>\n<li>Coke</li>\n<li>* Canoo ($GOEV)</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
