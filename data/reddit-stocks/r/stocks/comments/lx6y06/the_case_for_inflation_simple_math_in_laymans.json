Based on our simple equation, these factors mostly offset each other and therefore were not visibly inflationary.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 money supply increased from $15.1 trillion to $19.4 trillion (+28%) Note: Fastest growth rate since WWII</p></li>\n<li><p>From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 velocity declined from 1.4 to 1.1 (-21%)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Plugging into our equation:</p>\n\n<p>Year-end 2019: 1.4 x $15.1T = $21.14T annualized nominal GDP</p>\n\n<p>Year-end 2020: 1.1 x $19.4T = $21.34T annualized nominal GDP</p>\n\n<p>This represents a change in NGDP of just 1%! No inflation!</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>What happens next? Some of you have already gotten vaccines, others have already been sick and developed immunity. States have recently announced reopening completely, and national case counts are showing relatively steep declines as we approach vaccination and illness-induced herd immunity.</p>\n\n<p>What does this mean? Consumer spending habits are changing. Record high savings rates and savings balances are likely to revert to normal. We&#39;ll take vacations, go to concerts, eat out at restaurants, etc - all things we haven&#39;t been able to do for the last 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>This means a recovery in M2 velocity but with a new much higher base of money.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look back at our equation and make a few assumptions about the recovery of velocity.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Scenario 1: Velocity recovers to pre-COVID level at end of 2019</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>1.4 x $19.4T = $27.16T NGDP (+27% compared with year-end 2020)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Scenario 2: Velocity recovers and overshoots the pre-COVID level, say to the trailing 10-year average velocity of 1.5</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>1.5 x $19.4T =$29.1T NGDP (+36% compared with year-end 2020)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Scenario 3: Inflation becomes widely recognized and consumers/investors look for alternatives to holding cash, velocity spikes to the highest it has been in 10 years at 1.75 and inflation feeds on itself</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>1.75 x $19.4T = $33.95T NGDP (+59% compared with year-end 2020)</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>It is likely that this inflation will be spread out over more than a year, but the key question at hand is:</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;How long will it take for the price level to reflect all of this new money in the system and how long will it take for velocity to fully recover (or overshoot)?&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>In each scenario, even if it took 2-3 years we are talking about <strong><em>double digit annualized inflation rates...</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p><em>AND THAT IS BEFORE WE SEE THE IMPACT ON MONEY SUPPLY AND VELOCITY FROM YET MORE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS.</em></p>\n\n<p>Inflation rates may be <em>much higher</em> than the figures outlined above... and despite all of this the Federal Reserve continues to say that they see no inflation, that they are content to keep short-term interest rates at zero until 2023 or later. Asleep at the wheel if you ask me.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>What does it mean for <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> and your investment portfolio? In a nutshell:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Nominal interest rates are likely to rise, commodity prices (oil) will increase, real estate values will increase (REITs), the prices of all <em>real assets</em> will increase.</p></li>\n<li><p>Companies that are able to index their revenues to inflation (pricing power!) will be able to defend their earnings, while others will see input costs skyrocket and revenues fail to keep up.</p></li>\n<li><p>The equity markets are going to be volatile, with winners and losers. Companies that are highly leveraged and don&#39;t have pricing power may go bankrupt when they need to refinance debts at higher rates.</p></li>\n<li><p>Other companies with pricing power, low variable costs, or durable intellectual property will be huge winners.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tech/growth stocks that trade at obscenely rich valuation and who promise real profits years or decades into the future are going to get smashed. These so called &quot;long-duration&quot; equities, many of which are favorites on <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> and <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a>, even if they survive, may go from trading at 25-50x trailing revenues (on zero net income) to 5-10x revenue or less - examples: SHOP trades at 50x trailing revenues and 470x trailing earnings, ROKU trades at 27x trailing revenue on <em>negative earnings</em>. </p></li>\n<li><p>In relation to point 5, inflation-driven equity volatility is likely to result in <em>higher equity risk premiums</em>, or higher discount rates on forecasted growth. </p></li>\n<li><p>Those with fixed rate debt (e.g. 30-year fixed mortgages) will be well-protected as home prices appreciate and the dollars owed to the bank depreciate.</p></li>\n<li><p>Those on fixed incomes and those who hold cash balances will be punished by inflation. Those who are unable to see their wages increase with inflation (American middle class) will see their quality of life decline. Inflation will punish those without real assets, those on fixed income pensions, and those who save their cash. There&#39;s a whole other discussion about income and wealth inequality in here but we&#39;ll leave that for another day.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In the meantime, check out Epsilon Theory for a quick read - &quot;The Opposite of 2008&quot;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-opposite-of-2008-2/\">https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-opposite-of-2008-2/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
