I heard that there were many quarter earnings with losses but that gains were going to be seen in the future. We’re almost a year removed from the actual WSB hype of $BB, and I’m just curious, now that all the smoke has settled, what are the realistic expectations for the stock (not the actual company itself even though I know there’s somewhat of a correlation)? Is it just going to hover around the $7-12 price point per share for a long time or is there possibly something in BB’s future that may trigger some more growth in the price?",
