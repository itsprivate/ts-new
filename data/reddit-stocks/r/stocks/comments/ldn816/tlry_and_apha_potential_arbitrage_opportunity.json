The current price of APHA is lower than .83 of a TLRY share. Perhaps I&#39;m not understanding, but does this not mean that there&#39;s an obvious deal on APHA currently assuming the merger goes through? If the prices converge later, someone still would have been able to secure Tilray shares at a lower cost if they purchase now than simply buying Tilray shares. I&#39;m long on Tilray, and there of course risks (merger not going through, share price dropping significantly, etc.), but assuming these two stay the course and TLRY continues to rise isn&#39;t this a simple arbitrage opportunity? What am I missing?</p>\n\n<p>I additionally found an article which explains a way to limit downside (admittedly capping upside). Essentially the author suggests selling covered calls on APHA to maximize the arbitrage explained above. Would someone who is even more bullish be able to maximize returns even further by simply buying calls on Tilray currently for pre-merger?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any insight!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
