We expect some of the new hires to start with the company very soon,” Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said.\n\nKellogg also said there was no further bargaining scheduled and it had no plans to meet with the union.\n\nThe company said “unrealistic expectations” created by the union meant none of its six offers, including the latest one that was put to vote, which proposed wage increases and allowed all transitional employees with four or more years of service to move to legacy positions, came to fruition.\n\n“They have made a ‘clear path’ - but while it is clear - it is too long and not fair to many,” union member Jeffrey Jens said.\n\nUnion members have said the proposed two-tier system, in which transitional employees get lesser pay and benefits compared to longer-tenured workers, would take power away from the union by removing the cap on the number of lower-tier employees.\n\nSeveral politicians including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have backed the union, while many customers have said they are boycotting Kellogg’s products.\n\nKellogg is among several U.S. firms, including Deere, that have faced worker strikes in recent months as the labor market tightens.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/kellogg-to-replace-striking-employees-as-workers-reject-new-contract.html",
