  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**\n\nStocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last week’s volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:\\~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program)).\n\nLast week, equities came under pressure after the Fed’s July meeting minutes, which said “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” \n\nIn order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities.\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Food and Drug Association (FDA) officially approved Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech’s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine. Until now, it was administered under emergency use authorization. Moderna’s vaccine is likely to be approved in the next few days as well. Stock of vaccine-makers were higher. \n* Shares of cancer-research company Trillium Therapeutics (TRIL) were up 188% after Pfizer (PFE) acquired them for $2.26 billion. Andy Schmeltz, President of Pfizer Oncology said, “The proposed acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in Oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe”.\n* Existing home sales unexpectedly rose in July, marking consecutive monthly gains. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 2%, compared to a 0.5% dip expected. \n* Ford Motors (F) has doubled its production target for the new F-150 Lightning pick-up truck due to strong early demand. The company now has a target of producing 80,000 in 2024, up from its previous target of 40,000.\n* Target (TGT) announced it planned to triple the number of Disney (DIS) shops within its stores by year's end. Target started hosting these Disney “shop in a shop” locations in 2019.\n* Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said Boeing Co. will invest in the satellite-launching startup's planned $3.2 billion merger-listing later this year, an investment that comes as the plane maker's own space program faces hurdles. Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) are still reeling following Branson’s flight a few weeks ago.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $130 at Outperform. Stock currently around $120\n* Abbott Labs (ABT) target raised by Cowen from $125 to $140 at Outperform. Stock currently around $126\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Loop Capital from $208 to $253 at Buy. Stock currently around $228\n* Burlington Stores (BURL) target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $380 to $400 at Outperform. Stock currently around $343\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Barclays from $285 to $291 at Overweight. Stock currently around $260\n* John Deere (DE) target raised by Credit Suisse from $430 to $440 at Outperform. Stock currently around $362\n* Intuit (INTU) with two target raises. Stock currently around $553\n   * Jefferies Financial from $525 to $630 at Buy\n   * Barclays from $540 to $645 at Overweight\n* MongoDB (MDB) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $390 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $377\n* Ulta Beauty (ULTA) target raised by Piper Sandler from $386 to $405 at Overweight. Stock currently around $371\n\n“The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.” - Shakespeare",
