I am leaving aside my feelings about the inflation bit of this argument (I disagree that inflation will continue to run hot and that the FED will be forced to be more hawkish). Instead, I want to focus on proposing an entirely different and more justifiable reason why P/Es are so high and why the market is likely not overvalued.\n\nThe reason for the high valuations in the market is simple: growth. If the companies in the market are expected to grow faster than they have in the past, then they should be valued higher. This is in fact the case, as the current expected long run (5 years) earnings growth rate of the S&P 500 is 21.8% compared to the historical average expectation of ~12%. So how do we adjust valuations for growth? Enter a ratio that is not considered often enough, the price to earnings growth ratio (PEG): simply divide the forward P/E of the market by the long run earnings growth rate. The current forward P/E of the S&P 500 is 21.1, implying a PEG ratio of 0.97. The only times the S&P 500 PEG ratio has been lower in the past 27 years (as far back as the data goes for me) is late 2008, mid 2011, the last day of 2018, and in March 2020. Each of these times was followed by a historic period of outperformance. The median value of the S&P 500 PEG over the last 27 years is 1.25. \n\nSo by PEG standards, the stock market is actually undervalued quite a bit! Now naturally, the next question should be whether the long run earnings growth analyst consensus estimates are realistic. This is debatable and a discussion worth having, and I would hope that the bears don’t simply hand wave earnings estimates away and say they’re way too high. Even if we discount their estimates significantly, the S&P 500 has quite a bit of room to run through the end of 2022:\n\nLet’s consider long run earnings growth estimates are too high, perhaps by a very significant 20%, and by the end of 2022, the PEG reverts back to its long run mean of around 1.25. Therefore, the actual long term earnings growth rate would be 17.44%, and the forward P/E at the end of 2022 should be 21.8. Current analyst estimates for S&P earnings in 2023 are $236/share, so the implied S&P price by end of 2022 is $5,145, 16% higher than it is today, even if long term earnings growth is overly optimistic by 20%!\n\nI welcome your critiques and encourage avoiding hand waving or overly simple analysis without nuance.",
