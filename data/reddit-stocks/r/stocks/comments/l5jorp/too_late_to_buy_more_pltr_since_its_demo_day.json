I am a college student working part time. I love the company and the software services they provide. I am still somewhat new to the concept of things being priced in already.

I have a decently diversified portfolio already and I can definitely afford to lose this $200 worst case. Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
