I want to say that i believe in this firmly.\n\njust for curiosity i’ve seen this with the us stock market, and history states this is true. However i’ve checked different markets and this is not the case, for example with the Italian stock market (im italian) its still far below the 2008 crisis, similar the france, uk and japan stock market which are barely above their ath in the 90’s. And 20 years to be barely above is wasted time, imagining people start investing in their 20, at 40 they are still under or barely above.\n\nMy question is, is this statement only valid for the us stock market as its the leader in the world? As because for the italian stock market investors would still be below of a lot from ath (not only index but stocks also) \n\nMy english is bad hope you understood my question.\n\nThanks in advance.",
