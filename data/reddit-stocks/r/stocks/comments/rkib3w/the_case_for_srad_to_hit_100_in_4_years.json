  "selftext": "Tired of DKNG and PENN deep dives? Here's a stock pick and analysis we like.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* Demonstrates ability to create profits for investors in a market not known for its get-rich-quick profitability.\n* Out-performing sector companions in heavily hit market\n* Growing at 30% YoY while increasing margin.\n* P/S Ratio of 8.3x created purely by market conditions and not fundamentals.\n* Global market leader, poised to profit from US, Canada, India, Brazil and China legalization.\n* $1bn available to fund growth.\n\n$SRAD’s stock is at $17.70 and has been mostly dropping week on week from an opening of $27 - that's a 34% decline. In market cap terms, $SRAD has decreased from $8bn to $5.23bn. But let’s first compare it to some of its market companions:\n\n$GENI – down 66% from a high of $22.27 in last 3 months\n\n$DKNG – down 55% from a high of $63.39 in last 3 months\n\n$PENN - down 63% from a high of $130 in the last 12 months\n\nKAMBI.ST – down 56% from a high of SEK 518 in last 6 months\n\n$BETZ – down 27% from $32.06 in last three months\n\nSo why has $SRAD stock held up relative to its four other market companions? It seems to have less to do with $SRAD and more to do with the market in general and the woes of the competitor stocks individually.\n\n*Let's take a closer look.*\n\nFor instance, $GENI posted a disastrous Q3 EPS loss.\n\n$DKNG will miss their 2021 revenue guidance and are being short-sold after various investigations.\n\n$PENN are struggling with earnings misses and haven’t integrated brick and mortar with online\n\nKAMBI.ST haven’t yet recovered from Covid? Not sure…\n\n$BETZ, a Roundhill ETF serving as a barometer of the gambling stocks market, is weighed down by the poor performance of one of its biggest stocks $DKNG, but also $PENN, $CHDN, ENT and FLTR even though some gaming, casino and igaming stocks have held firm (e.g. $RSI), limiting the decline a little.\n\nIn contrast, in the meantime, $SRAD have signed or renewed deals with UEFA, Fanduel, ITF and the NBA. Q3’s earnings were seen as positive with almost all analyst coverage sticking with the $28.11 Price target average and $29.27 at SA . The NFL lost deal is not in play here as this news was public knowledge in April, a full five months before IPO.\n\nThere are three main assumptions on how $SRAD is going to make its way up to $100 ($29.5bn market cap) over the next four years.\n\n**1) The market will correct:**\n\nThe market for gambling stocks looks like a gamble itself at the moment. It's in a perplexing state of freefall, like a gambler stuck on a losing streak. However, combined with other sectors such as low-medium tech on the NASDAQ, the 40% baseline decrease is seen as completely reversible with no change to any fundamentals. Simply put, $SRAD’s price will bounce to $30 with no news and/or solid future quarterlies. If $SRAD was trading at $30, $100 would seem a more reachable destination rather than a trip to *crazy town*.\n\n**2) The market and $SRAD’s expected CAGR brings $SRAD’s stock price to $74 by 2025 (with continued EBITDA growth)**\n\nThe US GGR CAGR is predicted to be 47% for ‘20-25 meaning a GGR take of $10bn by 2025. To quote Morgan Stanley: “Gaming space already has a number of players, but if SRAD can achieve even a small sliver of the market, I believe this represents healthy upside to our long-term revenue forecasts.” Data providers supposedly achieve a maximum of 5% of GGR and say $SRAD has a 40% market share (commonly quoted), this would be $200m. If RoW GGR will be $190bn (estimates vary from $150bn to $400bn), $SRAD will take 40% of 1.5% (as GGR share is less accepted), that’s another $1.14bn. When we consider current revenues of $630m which are heavily diversified as seen in their earnings report, we can estimate a revenue of close to $2bn by 2025. That’s a CAGR of 26% which is easily achievable based on current YoY growth of 30%.\n\nAt $2bn and a 11x P/S multiple, we have a $22bn market cap and a stock price of $74.\n\nSA has $SRAD’s revenue for 2022 at $774m which is 21%. If we compound $630m at 21% for 4 years, that’s $1.3bn. Even at an 8x multiple, that’s a market cap of $10.4bn and a stock price of $35. So where is the risk?\n\n**3) The upside, making moves and surprising estimates earlier than scheduled**\n\nThe path to $75 by 2025 is set with conservative estimates regarding TAM of GGR, though at the bullish end of market share (40%). But if $SRAD can get to $1bn revenue quicker than forecast, say in 2022, their launching pad will be far higher. $1bn in 2022 (58% increase from 2022) leaves 44% CAGR to achieve $3bn 2025 revenue which will bring about the $100 stock price. Some catalysts include: Legalization of sports betting in China, California, India, Brazil, Florida, Texas in that order. But what if $SRAD decides to move into B2C? What if $SRAD take on ESPN with a profitable model? How about M&amp;A to capture a new market or region? If they risk big as DKNG did initially, the payoff clears the path to $100.\n\n$SRAD recently released their Q3 Earnings and it made for good reading:\n\n· Revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased 30% to $158.7 million\n\n· 2021E Revenue guidance $642.5m ($630m currently) and AEBITDA of $116m\n\n· Q3 Free Cash Flow $37m (+144%)\n\n· Total liquidity available as of 30th September 2021 - $1.02bn (from IPO, debt and profits)\n\n· U.S. revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 119% - $56.3 million in first nine months\n\n· Strong Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate of 128% at the end of third quarter of 2021\n\n**Risks**:\n\nThe bear case for $SRAD involves them trading at a 5X multiple and not 11-15x (currently 8.3x). This will be due to slowed CAGR of 15% which will have been caused by a slowdown in legalizations or even a complete lack of legalizations. Unlikely. And there are no indications of a bear reversal in $SRAD fundamentals.\n\nUnlike some companies, $SRAD talk openly about the risks which could materially harm their business. However, their 2020 numbers show they are Covid-proof since they actually increased revenue and EBITDA in 2020 and more so in 2021.\n\nOne obvious risk is that due to the factors outlined in their F1-filing, they lose market to competitors such as $GENI. The NFL loss proved $SRAD is susceptible to failures but the pattern didn’t continue as $SRAD have won the next four since.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n$SRAD is going to be a meal ticket for years to come. There's a pattern here. It has been returning profits to investors since 2008 or so says their earnings report! $100 a share belies a $29.5bn market cap and thus a P/E ratio of 14.75x at $2bn. It is certainly speculative but there is little downside for a company at $17.70 and P/S ratio of 8.3x and revenues of $630m when there are no discernible changes from the IPO at $27, market cap of $7.98bn and P/S of 12.7x. Even at an AEBITDA multiple of 40x, $SRAD is a value proposition compared to the largely unprofitable sports betting industry.\n\nDisclosure: I am not a financial advisor, invest at your own risk. I maintain a position in $SRAD – 227 shares, average cost at $20.22 and intend to DCA back up to $40.",
