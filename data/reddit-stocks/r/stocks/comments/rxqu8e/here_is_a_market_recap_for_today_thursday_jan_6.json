Economists are expecting the economy to add 444,000 new jobs.\n\nAdditionally, market participants weighed on today’s weekly unemployment report, which showed the first-time unemployment claims ticked up compared to the previous week but remain near 52-week lows, signaling a continued recovery in the labor market. Here are the numbers: \n\n* **Initial jobless claims, week ended Jan. 1:** 207,000 vs. 195,000 expected and a revised 200,000 during the prior week\n* **Continuing claims, week ended Dec. 25:** 1.754 million vs. 1.678 million expected and a revised 1.718 million during the prior week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the markets sold off after the Fed’s meeting minutes suggested the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation. \n\nThe meeting minutes said, “Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.\" \n\nMoreover, the minutes said, “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”\n\nHere is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Bloomberg data indicated roughly four in every 10 companies on the Nasdaq have seen their market values halve from their 52-week highs.\n* Gamestop (GME) stock jumped after-hours after the company announced it was launching a division to develop a marketplace for digital images and currencies.\n* According to Apple’s App Store listing, the former President’s social media app is set to debut on February 21.\n* Snap Inc (SNAP) has sued the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office over its decision to deny federal trademark protection for the company's Spectacles smart glasses.\n* Shares of Royal Caribbean fell roughly 3.5% after popular short-seller Hindenburg Research announced it was opening a short position against the company via Twitter. \n* Datadog (DDOG) announced a global strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services. The company said, “This extended partnership with AWS will help speed the pace of innovation for customers using AWS and Datadog, and we are excited to provide deeper product alignment and go-to-market initiatives to ultimately benefit our customers.\"\n* Shares of Beyond Meat (BYND) gapped up roughly 15% ahead of KFC menu item debut across the US\n* Mortgage rates rose to their highest level in more than a year and a half after details from the Federal Reserve's last policy-setting meeting released on Wednesday hardened expectations for a higher interest-rate environment.\n* The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped from 3.11% to 3.22% this week, according to Freddie Mac. \n* The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that U.S. factory orders accelerated in November, climbing 1.6% during the month. \n* The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that November's read jumped to a near-record $80.2 billion, 19.3% higher than the October deficit of $67.2 billion and just below the all-time monthly record of $81.4 billion reported in September.\n\n“You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated.” *-Maya Angelou*",
