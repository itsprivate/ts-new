If the post is inappropriate to write on this subreddit, please let me know.\n\nI'm a junior student living in Seoul, South Korea. And in my experience, I think it's nearly impossible to make a living out of ordinary income in this city. Everything is expensive here. While I'm expected to receive about $2300(thinking of becoming a police officer) per month as a starting salary,  the average monthly rent for a studio apartment in Seoul exceeds $800\\~$1000. Considering the living expenses and miscellaneous expenditures, it's nearly impossible to make a save money. Now I'm quite panicking about my future.\n\nAnyway, so I started investing since I was a high school student. I've done a lot of mistakes(including investment in GME) but in the end, I realized that it is important to make a sustainable investment. But considering my lack of investment budget, I'm confused about whether I should be more aggressive and either leverage my bank account or invest in high-volatility stocks. Or even invest in futures or options.\n\nMy ultimate dream is to have a $2M\\~$4M amount of assets before the age of 40\\~45, but it seems like a high hope to me. If you were in my position, what would you do? What should I do?",
