This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD's 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks, the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.\n\nThe Intel Core i5-12600K beats the Rocket Lake flagship, the Core i9-11900K, with ease and it shows that Intel is seriously going to give AMD a tough time in the mainstream segment if these numbers are to be believed. We are just a few weeks away from the NDA lift and the Core i5-12600K is going to be one chip that many consumers, especially gamers, are going to be interested in.",
