I keep receiving some hate concerning my opinions and I want to be crystal clear that they are just that; opinions. I also want everyone to know that is is meant to be a dialog. I am not trying to pump this stock because truthfully, this goes far beyond us retail investors at this point. What I want is a dialog between all sides to examine this truly fascinating phenomenon that is occurring.</p>\n\n<p>I would also like to clarify something, I am not a bagholder. I do currently hold bags because I own 336 shares at a $194.34 cost basis, however, that total amount is house money that was used from my profits on the first go around.</p>\n\n<p>I also understand some people are tired of hearing about this because it&#39;s the same regurgitated form of someone else&#39;s post as it keeps circulating in an attempt to retain hype and drive future buying; this is not what this post is about. As investors and individuals involved in the world of finance, this situation should absolutely intrigue us whether or not we are involved. I am here to present my logic on the situation but encourage healthy discussion and debate.</p>\n\n<p>This brings me to my first claim. This is <strong>not</strong> over. Now, I am not claiming that a squeeze will still occur, I am simply claiming it is not over, for better or for worse. Several things need to take place for this to be completely over, at which point I will either post my gains or my losses from the adventure.</p>\n\n<p>When I say &quot;it&quot; I am referring to this entire phenomenon, not one short squeeze. I do not think these events, &quot;it&quot;, is over. This is largely due to retail and institutional purchasing not really changing all that much since we found the bottom and established support at a staggering $60. This support was lost today and found new support at $50. There was very interesting ATH action and I&#39;m not sure what to make of it.</p>\n\n<p>Millions of bag holders (not just WSB) are still holding and in fact, averaging down, thereby purchasing more. These same bag holders are absolutely refusing to sell for such massive losses and in turn are becoming long term investors on the stock if another squeeze isn&#39;t to occur. People are picking up speculative positions in the off-chance of another squeeze. Others are determining this as a fair value for the company, not fundamentally, but based on the future prospects of Ryan Cohen and team. Finally, it is nowhere near leaving the global stage with important upcoming dates that we will discuss later.</p>\n\n<p>To examine why it isn&#39;t over let&#39;s look at both sides of the argument:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bulls claim it&#39;s not over for many reasons that you can find in the hundreds of other bullish posts, so I won&#39;t bore you with those details. My argument on the bull side is more along the lines of what I listed above.</li>\n<li>Bears claim it <em>is</em> over because there was a 2250% price increase over the course of two weeks, therefore this must be a short squeeze.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think we can all agree, bear or bull, that <em>something</em> happened. A 2250% increase certainly isn&#39;t nothing. The question is...what? I see several possibilities and would like to discuss them in the comments.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze.</li>\n<li>The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze, but the price increase was mainly hype and gamma squeezes.</li>\n<li>The shorts didn&#39;t cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.</li>\n<li>Some combination of the above 3.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>First, the data:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH\">morningstar</a> the short interest is showing 78.46%. Now, I think the website is having some issues storing cookies because it will show the outdated 226% unless you open it up in incognito.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme\">Market watch</a> is showing 41.95%</p>\n\n<p>This spread is interesting for sure, my thoughts are some of these calculations are including &quot;synthetic longs&quot; introduced by S3.</p>\n\n<p>It is extremely possible to manipulate these numbers via illegal methods and even legal methods using options. <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf\">Please see this SEC document to explain how this would work.</a> I am not trying to convince anyone to fit my narrative, but these things occur far more commonly than one would expect. The reasoning is because the fines for committing the crime are far less costly than letting the event take place. Please see <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases\">FINRA&#39;s website</a> for the long, and frequent list of fines being dealt out due to manipulation. A common culprit? Lying about short volume.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s use the absolute worst case scenario being reported of 41.95%, which mind you is still extremely high for one stock:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze</strong></p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s interesting here is even if the shorts 100% covered all of their positions, they very well could have shorted on the way back down. Why wouldn&#39;t you? It would be insane to not open a short position when this hit nearly $500 especially if you lost half of your companies money; what better way to get it back? For the remainder of this thesis, I will be assuming that some of the short positions that exist are newly opened positions at a higher price unless someone has a counter-claim as to why that wouldn&#39;t be possible/probable.</p>\n\n<p>That would mean 226% was covered on the way up and another 41.95% was reopened on the way back down. Based on the volume and price changes throughout the past two weeks this simply doesn&#39;t pass the math check. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Again, using 41.95% this is highly likely and the most reasonable case. Some, probably the worst positions, were covered on the way up. </p>\n\n<p>I think this is precisely what happened, we had some partial shorts covering but for the most part it was gamma squeezes, hype, and FOMO whereby the price started climbing so rapidly it became smarter for the shorts to just wait out the bubble than to actually cover all of their positions. </p>\n\n<p>Again, we fall into a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario regarding shorting on the way back down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The shorts didn&#39;t cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This scenario does not pass the math check using the 41.95% figure.</p>\n\n<p>If the data is being manipulated then this becomes very interesting because if some of the worst positions are still open then that means all of these HF&#39;s losses that were reported were strictly interest and they are simply waiting this out for as long as it takes making back their losses on their newly opened short positions in t $300-$400 range. </p>\n\n<p>Sadly, this puts us in the guessing range yet again. We can do the math and see it&#39;s possible this scenario exists, however, we would be comparing it against losses reported by the entities that were being squeezed. </p>\n\n<p>There are way to many what-if&#39;s for me to me consider this a possibility, but I can&#39;t write it off completely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some combination of the above 3.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Truthfully, this isn&#39;t worth examining just yet. There would be far to many &quot;what-if&#39;s&quot; to address, this is something that could be address at the later dates that we will get to shortly.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;ve heard it a lot regarding the 02/09 data. &quot;It&#39;s two weeks old&quot;. Well, that is always the case. The FINRA short data is always two weeks old and suggesting that we can&#39;t pull any information from it at all is asinine. Where it gets quite murky, is the data includes 01/27 information. This was a day unlike any other in this saga.</p>\n\n<p>I will take this moment to address the following upcoming catalysts and when I truly think this will be done; one way or the other.</p>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s data 02/09, was very important because if it showed an extremely low percentage then we know shorts have exited and did not re-enter and this is completely done. Given the data does not reflect that, we now must turn to several events that could act as catalysts for either a further squeeze or a complete shutdown.</p>\n\n<p><strong>02/19 -</strong> In <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">my last post</a>, I discussed the Failure To Deliver (FTD) conundrum. I do need some help figuring out the exact expiration date. From <a href=\"https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf\">here</a> &quot;The close-out requirement states that a participant of a clearing agency needs to take immediate action to close  4 out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The exact date is slightly irrelevant because I highly doubt all of these FTD&#39;s are going to deliver on the same exact day. <a href=\"https://wherearetheshares.com/\">This site</a>, while it isn&#39;t an official channel seems to be doing a good job of tracking data. If you want to learn more about FTD&#39;s and the implications there please visit that site or review my last post which has links to follow for further reading.</p>\n\n<p><strong>02/18 -</strong> Keith Gill aka <a href=\"/u/DeepFuckingValue\">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> will testify before congress and RH CEO Vladimir will be attending. This can go several ways which can lead to an SEC trading halt on GameStop or with evidence that proves foul play occurred. Who knows? It will certainly be interesting and I don&#39;t even to speculate on the market reaction to this even because it could go a ton of different ways; it will be an important date nonetheless</p>\n\n<p><strong>02/24 -</strong> The next FINRA short interest information will be made readily available to the public. This will be far more interesting and helpful information because it won&#39;t include the insane volatility of January, but it will also highlight the newest short positions. This data will help further drive where I think this is all going to end. It&#39;s possible that shorts opened new positions at $50 thinking it was going back to $12. Let&#39;s not speculate too much here either, it&#39;s just another dataset that will bring light to the direction this is headed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>03/05 -</strong> GameStop ER. This is big too for several reasons. First, this will include the console sales cycle which historically has done well for GameStop. A typical buy the hype, sell the news event. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts leading up to this ER, maybe people won&#39;t even touch GME leading up to then due to the recent volatility, but if they do, and if there is still a lot of short interest, this too could force shorts to begin covering. Another critical part of this ER is Ryan Cohen. This will be the first time this new board addresses the public with their plans for the future and for the first time since this entire adventure began, the &quot;dying brick and mortar&quot; narrative will finally begin to change in the public eye. That is still the common misconception regarding GameStop, that it is a dying brick and mortar retailer where nothing has changed. This hasn&#39;t been the case for around 6 months now, but this will be the first time it is publicly address. The headlines surrounding GameStop&#39;s future plans will be very interesting to read and the markets reaction will be far more interesting.</p>\n\n<p>I have been asked a lot what my PT is and when I expect the squeeze to happen, but let me be clear. Very seldom do squeezes &quot;just happen&quot;. In fact, short squeezes are far more common than one would think, they just typically happen over months, if not years and the shorts cover on dips so you don&#39;t even notice it&#39;s happening. In order to force a squeeze, you need to hold a decent amount of shorts underwater. Soon one will crack and start closing their position, this leads to a series of shorts closing their positions skyrocketing the price until more and more shorts need to cover. This is <strong>rare.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I hope this narrative of purchasing heavily shorted companies comes to a close soon because a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money simply buying up companies because they are heavily bet against. Catalysts and massive changes need to occur like overhauling your entire business as is the case with GameStop.</p>\n\n<p>Normally, shorts will close their positions one at a time, covering on dips and you don&#39;t even notice it&#39;s happening. In times where you see a price rise of seemingly no news could very well be shorts closing their positions because their research led them to realize this company is on the road to recovery.</p>\n\n<p>I digress. Given the most recent data and the multiple upcoming catalysts I am still very bullish on a GME short squeeze. My <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">post</a> from quite some time ago illustrated the importance of catalysts regarding a short squeeze, this is still very much the case. The first run was interrupted and the second run won&#39;t happen with magic, it requires a catalyst. Another post was titled <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">For those who do not understand the inevitable GME short squeeze</a>, was at the time &quot;inevitable&quot; because math. That is no longer the case. It is no longer inevitable but it is still possible.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be clear: This is not nearly as close to a sure thing as it once was and it depends on a lot of different factors. One of the largest is the people. Granted, a lot of what&#39;s happening now is in the hands of institutions but millions of retailers holding their positions to the grave certainly helps the institutional buyers have more faith in their play to continue a squeeze.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SO WHAT DO I THINK</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think shorts certainly covered some of their positions, but not all. I also firmly believe a significant amount of short positions were opened on the way back down by both HF&#39;s and individuals. Some certainly positioned high, but based on sentiment, it appears a lot of people think GME is fairly valued around $20 (which I disagree with but let&#39;s use that for the time being). That would mean shorts would have no problem opening positions at 100,70,60, even $50. </p>\n\n<p>42% is <em>still</em> very high which means a squeeze is inevitable so long as the company continues in a positive path. However, squeezes typically aren&#39;t as abrupt as people think. They are actually quite common, in fact another position I&#39;m heavily invested in is SPCE and they have been going through a squeeze for several weeks and will continue to squeeze so long as news continues to be positive. </p>\n\n<p>How would we get an abrupt short squeeze? A massive bull run. The new shorts that entered at lower levels wouldn&#39;t be too hard to catch, however, they are probably low volume, so when they buy to close, it won&#39;t be large enough volumes for massive peaks, but a bull run very well could lead to these lower tiered shorts closing, triggering a gamma squeeze. If gamma squeezes are made week over week then shorts at the higher end would have two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Close early and take profits</li>\n<li>Wait it out because they are positioned so well that interest means nothing and they don&#39;t think there is any hope of us rising to those levels.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In the first case, them closing early would be a nice short squeeze to probably several hundred dollars, but it wouldn&#39;t break $1000.</p>\n\n<p>To break $1000 we would need a big bull run to catch the shorts, trigger gamma squeezes, and keep momentum until they are caught and underwater. This is highly unlikely unless there is another global sentiment. </p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS I AM MAKING ARE BASED ON THE 42% REPORTING. IF IT IS IN FACT 78% THEN THE POSSIBILITY IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SO WHEN DOES IT ALL END</strong></p>\n\n<p>My though is if by the end of March these catalysts were not enough to reignite the hype and squeeze, then it will essentially be over except in the case of a few circumstances:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A VW/Porche moment occurs where a large buyer picks up a large portion of the company.</li>\n<li>Some other currently unknown catalyst appears seemingly out of thin air</li>\n<li>The data was in fact manipulated. Regardless of what the data says, if the shorts did in fact lie about their short int to take the fine over being squeezed, then they will be squeezed regardless. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is quite possible, that these catalysts and moments aren&#39;t enough to force a squeeze anymore especially if the shorts have repositioned really well. I will retain the mindset that this fateful January 2021 was <strong>not a short squeeze.</strong> However, that does not mean it will ever actually happen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SO WHAT IS YOUR PLAY HOOMAN?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, I am long on GME which is why I didn&#39;t mind hopping back in even at outrageous prices. I will continue averaging down and don&#39;t plan on selling for quite some time, probably several years. The reason for this is I believe in Cohen and his team to turn this into something unexpected and I imagine an eventual ROI. Once this is all said and done and I think either the shorts truly have covered or they simply got away with it (Mid March-ish), I will be posting my DD for GME as a long play regardless of the squeeze mechanics.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for joining me on this wild journey. I hope we can discuss some of these points in the comments like adults and truly try to grasp this wild situation we are all in. There are extremes on both sides from &quot;get over it, the squeeze happened&quot; to a cult like mentality on the other extreme. I hope through discussion we can find the moderate approach and further understand the market mechanics at play.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time</p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNING: Until the squeeze business is over for good, this is a very volatile and risky play. Joining now for the hope of a potential round 2 squeeze should only be done in a speculative manner with money you are willing to lose. This is more akin to a gamble than it is investing. I think the current market price is fair given the future prospects of the company but do your own DD, I will not be releasing any until this squeeze is put to rest.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I am still bullish on this scenario even at 42%, if it really is 78% then I am extremely bullish. There are a plethora of upcoming catalysts that could reignite the squeeze but even if none are powerful enough, with Cohen&#39;s new direction we could expect good news for quite some time forcing shorts to exit on a more spread out timeline. </p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I do not wish to sway your opinion in either direction. I simply seek to examine this interesting and volatile situation via crowd sourcing. What you do with your money is entirely up to you.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
