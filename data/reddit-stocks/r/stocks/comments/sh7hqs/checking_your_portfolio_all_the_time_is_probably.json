However, investing is one of those odd activities where the fruit of the labor actually comes from inactivity and patience rather than constant activity.\n\nAs a result, constantly looking at your portfolio every day or even every hour for some people will most likely lead you to make short-term price-based decisions. More often than not, decisions based on price or how the market is doing on one particular day end up costing you a lot of money.\n\nHere are some studies to help get some perspective on this:\n\n1. Fidelity Study: This study revealed that the best-performing investors were ones who were inactive, forgot their password, or were already dead. Why? Because these accounts didn't make hasty trades and simply held their investments long term.\n2. Putnam Investment Study: A study by Putnam Investment revealed that remaining invested between 2005 - 2020 would've made you an annualized 9.88% return in the S&amp;P. But if you missed just the 10 best trading days within this 15 yr period (just 10!) your annualized return would've been 4.31%.\n3. Forbes Article: There is a Forbes article that lays down how too much trading has caused investors to miss out on massive returns (due to bad choices as well as capital gains tax implications).\n\nSo what are the implications?\n\nIt is simply better to remain invested in the market and continue to DCA over time, even during downturns.
