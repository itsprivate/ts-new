How can I (and any other noobs who read this) get in as fast and cheap as possible on Monday morning? I already put in a buy order for 6 @ market, I had $400 available cash in my account, will I get 6 shares in the morning? If the price goes up before I get those 6 will I get as many as I can afford for the money I had in the order or do I need to cancel the order and buy for slightly higher? I&#39;m on Merrill Lynch self guided CMA if it matters.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
