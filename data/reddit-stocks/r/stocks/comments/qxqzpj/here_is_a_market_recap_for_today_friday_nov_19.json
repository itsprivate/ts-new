  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 19, 2021**\n\nThe stock market traded mixed today, with the both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) slipping whiled the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed on the day, driven higher by a strong performance in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.\n\nNotable Numbers Today\n\n* SPY: -0.19%\n* QQQ: +0.56%\n* DIA: -0.76%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%\n* Apple (AAPL): +1.70%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%\n* Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%\n* PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%\n\nMarkets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. \n\nJim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.”\n\nIn particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said “Just like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.\n\nAdding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. \n\nYesterday, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The FDA approved boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE, BNTX) and Moderna (MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines for all adults in the US.\n* Apple regained the mantle of most valuable company from Microsoft, with the company reaching a fresh all-time high today\n* After a pop in the beginning of November, weed stocks continued their steep declines as nationwide legalization efforts in the US continue to falter. The largest fund tracking the pot industry, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) tumbled to its lowest price since last year and is down 60% from its high in February.\n* As talked about yesterday, Apple (AAPL) is reportedly accelerating development on its fully autonomous Apple Car, set to debut in 2025. A Morgan Stanley analyst said the car would double revenues and market value.\n* The Pentagon announced it has issued formal solicitations to Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Oracle (ORCL) for a multibillion-dollar cloud-computing contract to replace the JEDI procurement, which became mired in litigation between Microsoft and Amazon and objections from Congress.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with a host of target raises following its earnings report. Average price target $175 at Buy. Stock currently around $150\n* ConocoPhillips (COP) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $90 to $95 at Overweight.
