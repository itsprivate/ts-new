[This visual](https://i.imgur.com/TDz4tDH.png) from Blackrock depicts on the left panel what the Fed has in past months estimated the future trend of interest rates to be.\n\nEach Fed meeting, the Fed members take a vote, and the median forecasted Federal Funds Rate (FFR) is plotted for the next few years. The so-called [dot plot](https://i.imgur.com/yc7sX2L.png) (Graph from Bloomberg) shows all the estimated forecasts by each member, but the Blackrock plot I linked takes the median trend and connects the median dots. We see the curves for several months up to June, with the actual FFR trend plotted in green (in the first plot). You can see can see that even though the actual FFR the last few months has not actually deviated very much from forecasts made back in September 2021, the trajectory is *much* steeper and scheduled to be a lot higher than what was anticipated.\n\nThis is why forward guidance and the *rate* of interest rate hikes matter. The December '21 curve and June '22 curve have dramatically different implications, and this has been a major (if not *the*) cause of this year's current bear market.\n\n[This is what financial conditions have done](https://i.imgur.com/HFC00NO.png) as a result. The Fed did this through forward guidance, not past interest rate hikes. Changes in that future curve immediately affect bond prices/yields in global government and corporate credit markets, and as a result, translate to dampened equity valuations.\n\nI took this data and graphs from [Blackrock's weekly market commentary](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/publications/weekly-commentary). They publish weekly their tactical (short term) and strategic (long term) views on different asset classes (emerging market stocks, private credit markets, etc.). I don't find those so valuable, but I do like their summary on markets each week. Here is the [year-to-date](https://i.imgur.com/ciFkuXa.png) performance of a broad set of assets. They write in this figure's caption that \"the two ends of the bars show the lowest and highest returns at any point this\nyear-to-date, and the dots represent current year-to-date returns.\"\n\n**This is separate from Quantitative Tightening**\n\nThe Federal Funds Rate being hiked is *not* the same thing as quantitative tightening (QT). QT refers to the Federal Reserve letting their assets bought during QE expire (mortgage backed securities and longer term government bonds). \n\nThe Federal Funds rate is the rate at which banks lend to each other in 'overnight lending facilities' to make sure they have adequate liquidity. The Fed manipulates this by buying/selling short term government bonds. This impacts short term borrowing rates primarily.\n\nQE/QT, on the other hand, is about non-traditional assets being bought/sold, like asset-backed securities, or longer term government assets. Alongside the Fed raising rates, the Fed is letting these assets expire without buying more, meaning funds are being taken out of the market to pay the Fed for holding these assets. That is, imagine the Fed bought a bond from the Treasury, the bond expires, and the Treasury pays the Fed the principal, and *poof* that money now disappears. The result has impacts on longer term borrowing rates. \n\nSimilarly, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pay the Fed the principal on mortgage backed securities. These transactions are completely different from those open market operations for the FFR, which are between banks and the Fed to impact the overnight lending rates.\n\nI have describe 'passive' QT, where the Fed just lets assets expire. Another more aggressive QT is called 'active' QT, where the Fed directly sells those longer term assets to remove them from its balance sheets. Passive QT is just letting them naturally expire on their own schedule. Active QT is more hawkish since imagine if one of the biggest buyers of mortgage backed securities in the market decided to start selling them. This would reduce their value (increased supply floating around the market) and raise their yields (need to demand more to hold them).\n\nOther central banks may start doing the same. The Bank of England also has been buying corporate bonds, and those will expire too. The Bank of Japan, if they ever reverse their QE, would have to actually sell their equities, since they not only buy long term bonds and asset-backed securities, but literal stocks!\n\n**Resources for more Reading**:\n\n1.
