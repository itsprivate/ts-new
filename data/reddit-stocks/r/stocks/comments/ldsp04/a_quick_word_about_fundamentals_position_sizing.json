Maybe you give more weight to ideas you have greater confidence in, but in no case should a single position take up more than 10% of your capital unless you&#39;re Warren Buffett.</p>\n\n<p>One very nasty fact of investing is that <strong>compounding works in reverse</strong> as well. If your portfolio suffers a 25% loss, you need a 33% gain to recover; a 50% loss requires a 100% gain. </p>\n\n<p>Realistically most people are financially and emotionally crushed by anything in excess of a 30% portfolio loss. It can take years to recover from blowing up like that, because the engine of compounding has to be restarted all over again.</p>\n\n<p>If you have appropriate position sizing and do some simple risk management (don&#39;t diamond hand it into the dirt...) one bad position cannot blow up your portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Even the best investor <strong>is not right every single time</strong>. Peter Lynch said he&#39;d be thrilled to be right just 60% of the time. </p>\n\n<p>If you do bad position sizing, and YOLO the majority of your capital into each position, <strong>even if you could be right 90% of the time</strong> you will eventually hit that 1-in-10 chance and all your gains are gone. </p>\n\n<p>Over in <a href=\"/r/GMEbagholdersclub\">/r/GMEbagholdersclub</a> there are many people who successfully traded up into a 6 figure account, felt like they were on top of the world, and got sent back to square one.</p>\n\n<p>The other reason to have many positions is it <strong>gives you choices</strong> - the worst part of bagholding a losing position is all your capital is tied up, and it&#39;s psychologically difficult to take a big loss and reinvest elsewhere, even if you know you should -- it&#39;s better to be able to focus on other positives rather than watching one position drag your entire portfolio down like an anchor.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>By the way, this rule does not make exceptions for blue chips or &quot;oh it&#39;s Apple, who cares if it&#39;s 40% of my portfolio, I&#39;ll never sell...&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I was motivated to make this post because one stock I own and had a ton of confidence in just missed earnings by $0.02 last week, and got hammered with a 12% price decline in a day. It&#39;s a boring dividend stock, and I&#39;d let it grow to over 10% of my portfolio because &quot;what could go wrong.&quot; It will come back eventually as the business is sound, but still a nasty shock for a very &quot;stable and safe&quot; stock.</p>\n\n<p>Markets are unpredictable and your best defense against that is to do risk management like a professional. Or just buy index funds.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
