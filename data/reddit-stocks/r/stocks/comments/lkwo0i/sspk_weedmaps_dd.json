They are essentially a data hub for dispensaries where people can either place an order for pickup or even delivery in legal areas. Dispensaries pay big money to be featured by WeedMaps. They are the leader for e-commerce &amp; advertising for the whole cannabis sector. </p>\n\n<p>The only hurdle for WeedMaps to jump through is regulations and legalization. Even Alabama is letting people smoke the ganja now.. plus Chuck Shumer (Senate majority leader) said it is a main focus of Congress to pass federal marijuana legalization laws. Seems to just be a matter of time now. WeedMaps is positioned to be one of the biggest beneficiaries from this. </p>\n\n<p>The app has almost 200k reviews and an average 4.9/5 star rating, obviously many people like the service. Essentially the Shopify of cannabis.. SSPK (WeedMaps) is an absolute steal in the 20’s. IMO this will be a “blue chip” cannabis stock along with GRWG in the long run. </p>\n\n<p>If this were an IPO as opposed to a Special acquisition company merger I’d expect it priced at 50+ like we saw with Bumble or Doordash. People will flock to this stock especially once the ticker changes. </p>\n\n<p>Financials🤓</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue forecast to grow at an annualized 40%, EBITDA at an annualized 55% through 2023</li>\n<li>WeedMaps generates 1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume alone</li>\n<li>Stock trades at enterprise value of 5.6x 2022 sales, well below SaaS comps. </li>\n<li>WeedMaps operates a high-margin marketplace services and never “touches the plant”</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
