  "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 15, 2021**\n\n*Sorry for not posting the recap yesterday, with the market bouncing so hard decide to take a day off and treat myself!*\n\nStocks rose on Friday, continuing a monster bounce in October that has seen the S&P 500 (SPY) claw back a lot of the losses suffered in September, and finish the week 2% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), which fell as much as 8% from its previous peak, closed the week a remarkable 2.65% higher while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the week 1.49% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week 1.43% higher. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected rise in retail sales in the US and a stronger-than-expected start to earnings season, which kicked off this week with big banks reporting. \n\nNot to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip. While I understood and have written extensively about the current risk factors in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in “doomsaying” headlines from mass media, doesn’t mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.\n\nThe Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  “The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.” \n\nThis week's early batch of stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results has helped assuage investors' concerns over a sharp deceleration in corporate profits, especially as expenses mount for companies across industries in the face of higher input and labor costs. \n\nSo far, Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Big US banks kicked off earnings season with a bang, with XLF, the ETF tracking all banks in the SP 500, jumping to record levels. \n* In a statement, Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch confirmed that last week’s data breach contained the company’s source code, but insisted that passwords, credit card info, and other sensitive info was not compromised.\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) spiked after unconfirmed reports that the company planned to spin off its ESPN operations. Reports later come out to discredit the original report so it remains unclear if anything is actually happening.\n* Chinese EV company NIO reportedly plans to increase production capacity by 20% at their main factory and aim for another 100% rise by mid-2022. Shares of the company are up 4% on the news.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) is shutting down operations of business social media LinkedIn in China following increased regulatory scrutiny, but the company still has other operations within the country\n* Disney (DIS) has unveiled a line-up of more than 20 new content titles from the Asia-Pacific region, including 18 original productions, that will be streamed over its Disney+ service. This is likely in response to the unprecedented success of Netflix’s (NFLX) Squid Game, which rapidly became the company’s most viewed showed ever.\n* Twitter (TWTR) said it was rolling out new ad features and revamping the algorithm that decides which ads as the company deepens its push for monetization and launch new eCommerce features. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apollo Global Management (APO) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $73 to $79 at Overweight. Stock currently around $67\n* Citigroup target raised by BMO Capital Markets from $84 to $86 at Outperform. Stock currently around $72\n* Dominos Pizza (DPZ) with two target raises.
