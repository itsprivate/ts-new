We don’t have a better offer to provide. This is it.”\n\nDeere will continue operating its U.S. plants with nonunion employees, Mr. Howze said, and it is considering sourcing replacement parts and machinery from its overseas plants.\n\nUnion leaders and negotiators for the striking Deere workers are discussing their next steps, a UAW spokesman said. The union had no specific response to Mr. Howze’s assertion that Deere won’t negotiate on a third offer with bigger raises.\n\nThe strike at Deere, the largest U.S. farm equipment manufacturer by sales, is set to head into its third week at a time when tractor and combine sales have been booming, and farmers are planning purchases for the coming crop year. Some farmers worry that an extended strike at the Moline, Ill.-based manufacturer could deepen shortages of new equipment and drive up prices for already-scarce used equipment, with factory production currently constrained due to a lack of semiconductor chips and other components.\n\nThe contract rejected Tuesday would have given more than 10,000 striking Deere employees an immediate 10% increase in pay, plus an $8,500 bonus for each worker and additional 5% pay raises in 2023 and 2025. That proposal followed a previous contract offer rejected by Deere workers Oct. 10.\n\nDeere shares settled 3.5% lower Wednesday, with U.S. stock indexes generally moving higher.\n\nEmployees said Deere should have provided bigger raises and benefit expansions, given a surge in the company’s farm and construction equipment sales, and the pay increases other employers have offered this year to recruit workers. Deere workers went on strike Oct. 14, the first walkout at the company since 1986.\n\nMr. Howze said the company negotiators were willing to consider employees’ demand for better raises and benefits after the first contract offer failed by a wide margin. But he said the company won’t go any higher than the second offer, which he said would cost Deere an additional $3.5 billion over the life of the contract.\n\n“There’s no benefit to be gained by staying out,” Mr. Howze said, referring to strikers holding out for a better deal by prolonging the walkout. “We want to get people back to work.”\n\nMr. Howze said Deere executives were encouraged by the level of support for the second offer after 90% of the voters reportedly turned down the first deal. He declined to elaborate on how Deere is maintaining operations with nonunion employees, but said some U.S. employees are working around the clock at some sites.\n\nEmployees of Deere have said they felt empowered to push for better terms from due to the current strength in the company’s business, versus negotiations in past years when equipment sales were slower, or general economic conditions weaker. For the full fiscal year, Deere has projected about $5.8 billion in income, compared with $2.8 billion in 2020 and $3.3 billion in 2019.\n\nRising demand for agricultural commodities and poor weather in North and South America have tightened crop supplies over the past year, and driven a rebound in the farm economy.\n\nwww.w sj.com/articles/deere-says-its-done-bargaining-after-striking-workers-reject-second-contract-offer-11635976220",
