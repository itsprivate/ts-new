It seems like a lot of companies with solid share growth, quarter over quarter, have negative income, ridiculously high PEs, or massive market caps. I understand that investing in stocks is often based on far out future potential, but I figured I own enough of those type of companies. </p>\n\n<p>I just picked up some shares of ENVA and MX. Both of these companies fit the bill I described above, PEs under 5, increasing net incomes quarter over quarter, and small market caps. Let me know what you think. </p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This is just my opinion, not financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
