This comes following a report that Omicron has now become the dominant variant in the US, accounting for roughly 73% of all cases reported last week.\n\nNew COVID-19 cases rose 9% in the United States in the past week but are up 57% since the start of December, according to a Reuters tally. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases)\n\nMoreover, the White House will deploy 1,000 military personnel to assist at hospitals as capacity starts filling up.   The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients has increased 26% this month, with hospitals in some areas already strained by the Delta variant that emerged earlier this year, according to that same Reuters tally.\n\n[https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/united-states/](https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/united-states/)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is in charge of approving and regulating new medications, is expected to authorize the Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) coronavirus treatment pills this week.\n\nLast week, Pfizer reported that its COVID pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-authorize-pfizer-merck-covid-19-pills-this-week-bloomberg-news-2021-12-21/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-authorize-pfizer-merck-covid-19-pills-this-week-bloomberg-news-2021-12-21/)\n\nMeera Pandit, global market strategist at JP Morgan, said “On the virus side, ultimately what we’ve seen with prior surges and prior variants is that market sell-offs tend to be somewhat contained to a period of time, so we do expect that as we get better and better at dealing with some of these challenges from the economic and market perspective, things will likely settle down despite some of the public health challenges we have ahead.”\n\nIn other news, market participants are also processing an unexpected blow to Biden's economic agenda after Senator Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) quashed the administration’s long-deliberated Build Back Better Act, citing concerns about inflation, the national debt and ongoing pandemic.\n\nLooking ahead, there is tons of important economic coming out:\n\n* Wednesday - The Conference Board is set to release its latest consumer confidence index, expected to show an only modest uptick for the month of December.\n* Thursday - Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measurement for inflation. Consensus data compiled by Bloomberg showed PCE is projected to climb at a 0.6% month-over-month rate in November.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* President Joe Biden in remarks Tuesday afternoon said he was considering a reversal of recent travel restrictions in light of Omicron\n* AT&amp;T Inc said on Tuesday it was selling its advertising unit, Xandr, to Microsoft. Xandr was created in 2018 through the acquisition of an ad exchange and a TV ad tech company to use data collected from phone, internet and TV services to target consumers.\n* Following the blocking infrastructure bill, Goldmans Sachs (GS) and Mark Zandi, chief economists at Moody’s, cut US GDP forecasts for 2022.\n* Moody’s, one of the main credit ratings agencies in the US, once again gave Apple the highest ‘AAA’ credit\n* The EU approved Microsoft’s (MSFT) $16 billion acquisition of Nuance, an AI-powered text to speech company\n* Workers at a Starbucks (SBUX) store in Seattle, the coffee giant’s hometown, say they aim to unionize, adding momentum to the organizing efforts at the chain.\n* Global merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity shattered all-time records in 2021,  $5 trillion for the first time ever, with volumes rising 63% to $5.63 trillion by Dec. 16, according to Dealogic data, easily surpassing the pre-financial-crisis record of $4.42 trillion in 2007.\n* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd has received approval from Taiwan's investment commission to set up a chip manufacturing plant in Japan.\n* Alphabet Inc's YouTube began restoring access to Walt Disney Co channels on its platform on Sunday, after the companies reached a distribution agreement to end a two-day blackout.",
