  "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 3, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today, reversing from yesterday’s losses and extending the current run of day-to-day volatility. Like I said yesterday, I expect a lot of choppiness moving forward as the market participants continue to balance record corporate earnings and expectations for economic expansion with concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. Looking ahead, market participants wait for the July Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday.\n\nConcerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida now emerging as the US’ new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. However, it is very important to understand that cases remain highly concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy, among other factors. For example, last week 1 in 3 new COVID infections came from just two states: Texas and Florida, according to the White House. While one always has to understand the risks present in the market, in my humble opinion, I don’t think the Delta variant will weigh too heavily on the US economy as a whole. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* General Motors (GM) said it will be closing three of its North American assembly plants next week due to the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* Shares of Tencent (TCEHY) fell 10% after a state-media called video games \"spiritual opium\". This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. Looks like the regulatory crackdown in China continues…\n* After a disappointing IPO, shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up more than 25% today. Stock is now roughly 27% above it’s IPO price of $38 \n* French pharma giant Sanofi bought Translate Bio, a biotech company focused on using mRNA to develop other vaccines and therapeutics. Paul Hudson, Sanofi CEO, said of the acquisition, “Translate Bio adds an mRNA technology platform and strong capabilities to our research, further advancing our ability to explore the promise of this technology to develop both best-in-class vaccines and therapeutics.”\n* Yesterday, semiconductor company Micron Technology announced it was starting a $0.10 dividend, a great sign that company operations are strong. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Arista Networks (ANET) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $420 at Buy. Stock currently around $380\n* Amphenol (APH) target raised by Cowen from $75 to $80 at Outperform. Stock currently around $74\n* Digital Realty Trust (DLR) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $167 to $175 at Buy. Stock currently around $155\n* Global Payments (GPN) Target raised by Morgan Stanley from $216 to $219 at Outperform. Stock currently around $170\n* Linde (LIN) target raised by Wells Fargo from $340 to $360 at Overweight. Stock currently around $303\n* MercadoLibre (MELI) target raised by Credit Suisse from $1824 to $2050 at Outperform. Stock currently around $1575\n* ON Semiconductors (ON) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $60 at Buy. Stock currently around $45\n* Restaurant Brands International (QSR) with two target raises. Stock currently around $66\n   * Credit Suisse from $74 to $76 at Outperform\n   * Royal Bank of Canada from $73 to $80 at Outperform\n* SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) with two target raises. Stock currently around $300\n   * Piper Sandler from $342 to $351 at Overweight\n   * Goldman Sachs from $322 to $368 at Buy\n* Square (SQ) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $320 at Buy. Stock currently around $270\n* Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) target raised by Wedbush from $212 to $222 at Outperform. Stock currently around $160\n* ZoomInfo Technologies (ZI) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $75 at Buy. Stock currently around $56\n\n“If the plan doesn’t work, change the plan but never the goal.” - Unknown",
