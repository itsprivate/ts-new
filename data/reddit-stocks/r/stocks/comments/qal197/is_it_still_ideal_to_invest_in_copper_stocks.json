Just recently state miner Codelco’s copper production for the month of August took a dip, going down by 6.7% year-on-year to 144,500 tonnes due to a strike in one of their mines. BHP, another big company, showed a drop in their copper production as well because their Escondida mine has issues in operation due to the imposed restriction caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Chile is the top producer in the world when it comes to copper, so the production getting affected is a big deal.\n\nAnother issue is also the problem with property giant China Evergrande Group. The company encountered a debt crisis that caused copper prices to fall, fueling worries about the demand for the metal. The price touched at $4.090 per pound ($8,998 per tonne) on the Comex market in New York. Though it seemed to have bounced back recently after they announced a deal over a $35.9 million bond interest payment.\n\nBecause of all these. I’m contemplating if it’s still smart to invest in it. I’ve been looking into some recently. I got my eyes on bigger ones like BHP and FCX (especially this one, I heard a lot of good things about it). I feel like it is safer to invest in these since they are already big producers.\n\nI’m also looking into some juniors though because of the return I might get despite the risks of investing in it.
