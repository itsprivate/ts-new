Stocks advanced today, reversing hard in the morning to the upside, though all three major indexes closed out the week negative once again. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.19% higher but finished the week -1.86% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) continued its streak of underperformance, pressured by rising Treasury yields, closing the day 0.51% higher but finished the week -2.71%, one of the worst weeks all year. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day 1.45% higher, driven by strength in financial and energy stocks, but closed the week 1.37% down. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day 1.68% higher but the week -0.38% down.\n\nMarket participants continue to closely monitor developments coming out of Washington DC, with Congress managing to avoid a government shutdown by passing a last-minute bill yesterday night.  Right before the midnight deadline, President Biden signed into law a short-term appropriations bill that will keep the government running through at least December 3, successfully avoiding a government shutdown. The Senate and House approved the funding legislation earlier Thursday. The Senate passed it in a 65-35 vote as all 50 Democrats backed it and 15 Republicans joined them. The House passed the bill by a 254-175 margin. Every Democratic representative and 34 Republicans supported it.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/government-shutdown-congress-moves-to-pass-funding-bill.html\n\nFocus will now shift towards debates surrounding the bipartisan infrastructure bill and raising the debt ceiling before mid-October, which is the estimated timeline when the debt ceiling will be hit. Earlier today, President Biden went to the capital to try and salvage plans for the infrastructure bill after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to delay the vote she scheduled today. This is due to disagreements in the party between moderates and more progressive members, particularly with Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who oppose the size of the infrastructure bill. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-struggle-reach-deal-congress-bidens-agenda-2021-10-01/\n\nA historic U.S. debt default could occur around Oct. 18, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has estimated, if Congress fails to give the government additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of $28.4 trillion. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it \"as early as next week,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. \n\nPut simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moody’s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. “Internationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline”\n\nThe report goes on to say, “Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government’s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.”\n\nHere is a link to the full report, I encourage you to read it\n\n[https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf)\n\nThis is huge! Merck (MRK) said it developed an oral drug that reduces the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by around 50% for patients with mild or moderate cases of coronavirus and has filed for emergency use authorization with the FDA.
