These are things to look at</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Below is my  Guide on HOW TO ANALYZE &amp; RESEARCH A STOCK, and what you should look at when evaluating a stock</strong> (This is my checklist just build from years of wins &amp; losses, things I learned from Pace University and Goldman Sachs).  If I am investing large amounts of cash, I want to research thoroughly, so if the stock drops I can stick to my convictions, and forget about emotion.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Before I use my time to research a stock, read up about it into detail, and dig into the financials, news, and 10-K, I check these <strong>two</strong> things first, to decide if I should use my time to dig further:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I quickly look at <strong>price upside</strong>. I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the price targets. (Money is a tool, and you want it to work for you). MarketBeat.com can show you this: <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/price-target\">https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/price-targe</a>t/</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I look quickly at the <strong>charts and the technicals</strong>. I try to read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? A site you can use to interpret the charts for you is BarChart.com and TradingView.com</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/opinion\">https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/opinion</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-AAPL/technicals/\">https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-AAPL/technicals/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>If it passes these two quick tests, then I start to dig deeper.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Other things I look at:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>&#x200B;</li>\n<li><strong>Sentiment &amp; News</strong>. I Google the company. I search the ticket on Twitter. What are people saying?  How do they feel? </li>\n<li><strong>Earnings &amp; revenue history.</strong> Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the projections. Are the making money? Will they make money?</li>\n<li><strong>Growth</strong>. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q&#39;s, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. Is there potential?</li>\n<li><strong>Financial health</strong>. Are the financials strong? (Quick ratio, Profit margin, EPS, Income Statement Trend, Cashflow). Can this company survived? Is it managed well?</li>\n<li>I dig deeper into <strong>technical analysis and the charts.</strong> I look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc. What is the Long term trend? What is the short term trend?</li>\n<li><strong>Valuations</strong>. How is this valuated? (PEG ratio, P/E ratio). Is it over-valued? Is it undervalued? </li>\n<li><strong>Short selling.</strong> How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? </li>\n<li><strong>What is the put/call ratio?</strong> Are people betting against this stock to go down?</li>\n<li><strong>Peers &amp; competition</strong>. How does this company stack up against its competitors and peers? How do the financials compare? How to the products compare? Is there a moat?</li>\n<li><strong>Institutional Sponsorship.</strong> Are big banks and wall street holding this? How much or this company&#39;s stock do they hold?</li>\n<li><strong>Insider Trading</strong>. Is the CEO buying or selling shares?</li>\n<li>The amount of <strong>ETFs</strong> that hold this stock. Will they continue to buy it up and drive price over time?</li>\n<li><strong>Average volume</strong> traded. Is this stock liquid? Would I be able to get my money back? How easy can I trade it? (The higher the volume, the thinner the bid/ ask spreads)</li>\n<li><strong>Social sentiment</strong>. I check what people are saying on twitter, reddit, and google search trends. Is it trending?</li>\n<li><strong>News moves a stock.</strong> So I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. Are there potential catalysts that may move the stock? </li>\n<li>For more tips or strategies check: <a href=\"https://www.flowcode.com/page/fluentinfinance\">https://www.flowcode.com/page/fluentinfinance</a> </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There are many sites, tools, or resources you can use to dig into a stock such as (1) Yahoo Finance, (2) MarketBeat.com, (3) MacroTrends.com, (4) MarketWatch.com, (5) CNNMoney.com, (6) CNBC.com, </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I use an excel spreadsheet to organize my research: <a href=\"https://www.flowcode.com/page/fluentinfinance\">https://www.flowcode.com/page/fluentinfinance</a> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Check my prior/ past reddit posts for other analysis/ tips</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: do your own research, make your own decisions because nothing is guaranteed, and I am not a financial advisor</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
