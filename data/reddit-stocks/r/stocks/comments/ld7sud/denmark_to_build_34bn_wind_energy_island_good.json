This basically means they will install a shitload of wind turbines. As both Vestas (wind turbine manufacturer) and Orsted (wind farm developer) are Danish and the biggest players in their fields, it seems logical to me they will be the preferred companies for this project. Both stocks have been experiencing a dip the past month so it seems the market hasn&#39;t caught up yet with this news. Buying opportunity ahead you think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
