Federal government outlays, residential  investment and inventories weighed on the figure.\n\nPersonal consumption, the biggest part of the economy, advanced an annualized 11.8%.\n\nThe  inflation-adjusted value of domestically produced goods and services  climbed to an annualized $19.36 trillion, eclipsing its pre-pandemic  peak.\n\nThe median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists  called for an 8.4% increase in second-quarter GDP. Stock-index futures  climbed after the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose  and the dollar weakened.\n\nEmboldened by vaccinations, federal  financial relief and a broader reopening of the economy, Americans had  both the wherewithal and the opportunity to ramp up spending on services  such as dining out. The extra cash paired with robust hiring helped  sustain outlays for merchandise as well.\n\nLooking ahead, economic  growth will be challenged by waning government support and lingering  supply and labor constraints. At the same time, the rapidly spreading  delta variant of Covid-19 present risks to the spending outlook.\n\nMore stories like this are available on [bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/)\n\n[Subscribe now](https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/67obqkd5zdp5lj8/?utm_source=yahoo_usn) to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",
