Coke is supposedly a mature dividend stock, but it's trading like a growth stock.\n\nIn reality, Coke's revenue has deceased over the past 10 years.  Coke pays a dividend of 2.8%, compared to a ten year treasury yield of 2.9%.  Why these crazy high multiples?  Because recession fears have pushed equity holders into staples, energy, or utilities.  So there's a market inefficiency to exploit because too many people are crowded into too few areas.  And nobody is shorting staples stocks right now, so puts are very cheap.\n\nOptions are dangerous because you can lose your entire investment.  Nibble at first and don't overextend yourself relative to your portfolio.  But I think Coke will fall in half from these levels and long-dated puts here can be very profitable given their current cost.\n\nI might be early but I'm not wrong.  In 10 years Coke will not trade at today's multiples.",
