But we're only 4 months in and people on here are first-hand admitting they're doing it because they are fed up of looking at red.\n\nI would try to get more cash in any other possible way before I sell something in the red, even when it looks likely we're going down further from here. Because in 5-10 years, this fall will be a distant memory. I would get a second job, sell my things, reduce all luxury spending to zero...all before selling positions that are 30%+ down.\n\nIs anyone else finding the \"I'm selling everything\" attitude to be beyond unbearable?
