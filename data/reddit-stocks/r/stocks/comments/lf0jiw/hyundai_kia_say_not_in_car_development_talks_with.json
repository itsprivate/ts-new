Hyundai said the discussions are in early stages. Hyundai shares fell as much as as 8.4% in Seoul, while Kia slumped 15.3%.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s plans for an electric vehicle are shrouded in secrecy but they’re been watched intensely. That’s because the car project has the potential to upend the automotive industry similar to how its iPhones, iPods and iPads have shaken up the consumer-electronics market. There are now millions of design-conscious shoppers globally devoted to the tech giant.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
