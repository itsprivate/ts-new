I don’t understand why a monolithic investment firm should be allowed to be exempt from a bunch of laws that seem to directly pertain to them and their activities ‘just because they want to be.’ It has made me very angry (along with all the other BS this year, of course), and so I’m taking action, and I hope you’ll all join me.\n\nI’ve created a petition at Change.org with the goal of imploring the SEC to disallow Citadel from being exempted from the 1940 Investment Company Act. Now, I know what you might be thinking – you see these Change.org petitions pop up all the time, with people wanting you to support this and that cause, and you’re doubtful if they can actually have any impact; but, well, you never know.
