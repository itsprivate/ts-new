  "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nIn case you don’t know what Virgin Galactic is I’ll provide a brief overview about their company:\n\n-Virgin Galactic is a British-American spaceflight company that operates in the United States. It was founded by Richard Branson and his Virgin Group retains a 24% stake. It is developing commercial spacecraft and aims to provide suborbital spaceflights to space tourists.\n\nGreat! Now let’s talk about what they are expected to achieve in the future and their upcoming catalysts.\n\n•First and foremost, THIS SUNDAY they’ll send the Billionaire and founder Sir Richard Branson to space! This means he will be the first billionaire to go to space while competing with Blue Origin (Jeff Bezos company- Former Amazon CEO). He recently arrived to Spaceport America and is currently ongoing preparations for the flight. After this flight they will be ready to start commercialisation and start making revenue in early 2022. (On the earnings call they predict an estimated 400 flights per year in future years with major celebrities on board i.e Justin Bieber, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, etc.)\n\n•In addition, after the test flight Richard Branson is expected to announce ”something very exciting” [source (1:20)](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1410727434530422784?s=20) \n\n•The third catalyst is Jeff Bezos Blue Origin flight that will take place the 20th of July. This company is a competitor for Virgin Galactic and just like $SPCE they will start commercialisation after their flight. This is relevant catalysts due their auction showed us the high demand for the space tourism sector. The bid for one ticket topped a whooping $28 Million!\n\n•Let’s not forget that in late 2020 Virgin Galactic signed an agreement with Rolls Royce to design super sonic jets. These jets are supposed to take you from New York to London in just 2 hours. Will there be an announcement about this later in the future? [source](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/)\n\n•Virgin Galactic is supposed to expand their fleet ([VS3 Imagine](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-vss-imagine-the-first-spaceship-iii-in-its-growing-fleet/) and expand operations into the UK in Cornwall Airport. Boris Johnson- UK prime minister recently authorised this airport for space related launches. [source](https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/how-spaceport-cornwall-help-create-5547712)\n\n•Lastly, there will be another flight later this year which will take the Italian Air Force to space for research. [source](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-and-italian-air-force-announce-world-first-government-contract-for-human-tended-research-flight/)\n\nI hope this post was useful for you. It’s obvious this company has an exciting future ahead! ✅ Please join r/SPCE for stock discussion!\n\n(Image for post: https://media.wired.com/photos/5c12e820d396be0cb1d2b1e2/125:94/w_2374,h_1785,c_limit/VSSUnity_120316_VG01_A2A_OO021.jpg)",
