Look at mortgage for example (earlier in the interview they talked about how home builder stocks were dropping).\n\n* Fed should definitely still do the 50 points, but in July they should take close look at money supply before making more drastic decisions.\n\n* To some extent Fed should accept inflation and aim to get to 2-3% long term. Don't overreact \n\nSomewhere in the middle the interviewer challenged him and asked \"Well aren't you the one who was asking for more drastic action?\"\n\nMy read on this is that Siegel is saying the two 50 point raises announced are good. But the other language Fed has been dropping recently about doing more -- he doesn't support that when money supply is this low.\n\nIs this:\n\n* Good news because if even Siegel is telling Fed to chill maybe we're not going to get more than the 2 x 50 point hikes.\n\n* Bad news because if Fed ignores Siegel and go harder on the rate hikes we'll go into recession.\n\nEdited to add: OK the interview is now up on Youtube.
