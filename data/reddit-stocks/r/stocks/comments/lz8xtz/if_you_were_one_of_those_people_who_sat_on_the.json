Then when it started going up they still didn&#39;t buy because they missed the bottom or they became convinced a second crash was coming and the lows would be revisited and they&#39;ll have their chance to buy.</p>\n\n<p>Well we know how that turned out.. they might just be thinking this recent correction is <em>the</em> infamous second crash they&#39;ve been predicting all these months.</p>\n\n<p>I know there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty going on in the markets recently and you&#39;ll find plenty of doom and gloom stock market articles on the internet if you look for them.. You might be looking at this recent correction combined with reading doom and gloom headlines and gleefully rubbing your hands thinking to yourself &quot;I knew my time would come, now I just need to wait a little bit more and then I&#39;ll buy, probably close to the bottom&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>But this will almost certainly be a terrible mistake, and it would be the same terrible mistake you made last time. I get it, psychologically you want to buy at the cheapest possible price so you get the biggest return AND you lower your downside loss potential. It&#39;s very attractive and the temptation to try and time the market sucks you in, you become so fixated on not losing money and buying the cheapest price that you end up never making money either because you never pluck up the courage to actually buy in the first place.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I have a friend who pulled his money out of the S&amp;P in 2008 at around the 1000 point market (a 30% loss) to try and buy in lower, and while the market did in fact go lower, he was unable to time the bottom because he waited too long and was too greedy. To this day he still has not bought back in... Not because he thinks the price is going back to 1000, but because he is so bitter that he made this mistake he just cannot bring himself to pay the now 250% - 300% increased price.</p>\n\n<p>At first he waited, then he waited some more and after a few years he lost interest because the price was so much higher than when he sold, especially when the price went past the previous ATH, he completely gave up on the stock market as being a viable investment and instead put his money in a savings account. I&#39;ve not seen or spoken to him for a few years but I know him, there&#39;s no way he would have bought into the market, he was too bitter.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s the moral of this story / rant? Don&#39;t be like my old friend... Don&#39;t try to time the bottom. Don&#39;t be greedy. Just accept the discount that&#39;s on offer and buy in, then if it drops more, buy some more using your salary. Because if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re very likely to be stuck in the perpetual cycle of waiting for a correction that you end up inevitably missing the timing anyway. </p>\n\n<p>And I know there are some people who will read this, or posts like it, and they&#39;ll tell themselves they are right and they can time the bottom but however strong your conviction, just know that you are almost certainly going to miss the bottom, so why bother trying?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
