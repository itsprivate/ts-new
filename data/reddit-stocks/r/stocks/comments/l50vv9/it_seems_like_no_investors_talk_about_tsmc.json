Buying TSMC is going to let you ride the wave on all those tech companies. They also have a short volume of around 16% which makes no sense considering how good their outlook is. They maintain massive profit margins and enjoy economies of sale. Seems like a definitive good buy and a $250 EOY</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
