Since then, to allay investor  concerns related to government contracts, the company diversified to  commercial business and now derives almost half its sales from the  private sector.\n\nCommercial revenue grew 46% in the second quarter, with U.S. commercial revenue more than doubling.\n\nHowever,  the company's international business, which makes up roughly 40% of its  sales, was hit by foreign exchange headwinds, Glazer said.\n\nOn an  adjusted basis, the company lost 1 cent per share in the reported  quarter, which was in part due to Palantir's investments in SPACs,  according to Glazer.\n\nQuarterly revenue rose 26% to $473 million.\n\nPalantir  now expects total revenue for the full year between $1.900 billion and  $1.902 billion as the base case, or a growth of about 23%, compared with  the 30% or more growth forecast by the company earlier. Analysts had  expected revenue of $1.96 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe  company forecast third-quarter revenue between $474 million and $475  million, compared with estimates of $506.9 million.
