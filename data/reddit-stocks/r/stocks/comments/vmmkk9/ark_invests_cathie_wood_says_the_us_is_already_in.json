I’ve been around for 45 years.”\n\nThe innovation-focused investor said inflation has turned out to be hotter than she had expected due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks.\n\n“We were wrong on one thing and that was inflation being as sustained as it has been,” Wood said. “Supply chain ... Can’t believe it’s taking more than two years and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine of course we couldn’t have seen that. Inflation has been a bigger problem but it has set us up for deflation.”\n\nInflation measured by the consumer price index rose 8.6% in May from a year ago, the fastest increase since December 1981.\n\nWood said consumers are feeling the rapid price increases, reflected in sentiment data that’s fallen to record lows. She pointed to the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, which showed a reading of 50 in June, the lowest level ever.\n\nThe popular investor has had a tough 2022 as her disruptive technology darlings have been among the biggest losers this year in the face of rising interest rates. Her flagship active fund Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is down a whopping 52% year to date, falling 66% from its record high set in February 2021.\n\nStill, Wood said her clients are mostly sticking with her and new money is coming in as investors seek diversification in a down market. ARKK has had more than $180 million in inflows in June, according to FactSet.\n\n“I think the inflows are happening because our clients have been diversifying away from broad-based bench marks like the Nasdaq 100,” Wood said. “We are dedicated completely to disruptive innovation. Innovation solves problems.”",
