It posted revenue of $54 million, well below investors' expectations of $60 million.\n\nAs of Thursday's market close, Rivian's share price had dropped about 77% and lost $124.5 billion in market capitalization since hitting its peak after going public in November.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Amy Caren Daniel and Matthew Lewis)\n\n[Source](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/news/basicNewsStory.jhtml?symbols=RIVN&amp;storyid=202203101651RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_KCN2L72KI-OUSBS_1&amp;provider=RTRSNEWS&amp;product=COMBINED&amp;sb=1)",
