Red flags abound.</p>\n\n<p>-Under new accounting, Tesla could recognize lease sale as regular revenue so long as the expected future fair market value (determined by Tesla) exceeded the guaranteed buyback price.</p>\n\n<p>-But looking closer at the description of these new leases, it seems tailor made to overestimate sales via financing agreemens (repos) with offshore entities. </p>\n\n<p>-Only problem is that cars depreciate. In a repo, you pay a higher price at the end of the term than you receive in initially, therefore any sales would have to be written off as the counterparty&#39;s &quot;put&quot; is int he money - indeed Tesla 1Q2019 wrote off $500M in sales.</p>\n\n<p>-To fix this problem, in 2Q2019 Elon and Tesla make the claim that the Model 3 is an &quot;Appreciating Asset&quot; based on its potential future FSD capabilities, providing public corroboration to underpin its accounting claim it was about to make</p>\n\n<p>-Setting the stage for Robotaxi Repo. By claiming the Model 3s were appreciating asset, they could recognize 100% of revenue for their excess production, without recognizing any offsetting liability or write downs as the estimated future value would exceed the buyback price.</p>\n\n<p>-Beginning in 2Q2019 Tesla &quot;Other&quot; international revenue mysteriously exploded, as its inventory dramatically shrank. From 2Q-4Q2019 these sales represented 36% of total Tesla revenue. Tesla stopped breaking out this category in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>-We estimate $2.5bn of Robotaxi repos took place over three quarters in 2019. Operating cash flow ex. this amount was negative. FCF was -$2.5bn vs $0.0bn as reported. This could have included up to about 100k cars or likely 10%-30% of 2019 deliveries depending on sales price.</p>\n\n<p>-All Teslas key metrics rebounded substantially from 1Q2019 and have remained strong going forward.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
