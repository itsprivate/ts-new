First to understand shorting ratios, you need to know what outstanding shares are. There are two:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shares Outstanding</strong></p>\n\n<p>The TOTAL NUMBER of shares a company has. Period. It includes: Owners, Insiders, Institutional, shares that are locked up, Available to general public, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shares Float</strong></p>\n\n<p>The total amount of shares to TRADE in the general Stock Market.</p>\n\n<p>Pretend: Stock XYZ has <em>400M shares float</em>, <em>50M shares shorted</em>, and <em>daily volume of 10M shares</em>. Now, let’s finally get to the shorting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Ratio</strong></p>\n\n<p>The number of <em>days</em> it would take ALL the shorts to cover their positions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Formula is: Shorted/Volume, so in this case: 50/10 = 5. It will take 5 days for ALL shorts to cover their positions if they were to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Short Float</strong></p>\n\n<p>What percentage of AVAILABLE shares (Shares float) are currently being shorted.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Formula is: ((Shorted/Available) * 100) shares. So, (50/400) * 100 = 12.5%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Short Interest</strong> <strong>(Shares Shorted)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Pretty much like Short Float. The quantity of stocks that investors have sold short but not yet covered or closed out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Squeeze</strong></p>\n\n<p>When stock price rises and the investors who shorted the stock are in RED getting a margin call. They have to immediately buy back the stock to close their position.</p>\n\n<p>But… how will they close GME? The diamond hands aren’t selling. They’re riding it to the moon.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Edit</em>: Thanks but please don&#39;t give me awards lol. Spend it buying stocks and getting rich. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
