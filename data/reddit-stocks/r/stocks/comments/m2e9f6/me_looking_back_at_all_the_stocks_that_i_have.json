I&#39;ve been salty about W until GRWG rose to 60&#39;s from 3. It makes my 10K gains from 22.5K look bad, most of which were from one stock.</p>\n\n<p>If you can&#39;t see the image for some reason, the stock in question are: grwg, se, tsla, W, nvax, cake, bpy. Almost all of which that I have owned for a short period or was serious considering buying but didn&#39;t do it for some reason. There&#39;s a few others stocks but these are the most notable ones. Other stocks I wanted and had were SAVE, LUV, CCL, DAL, IMAX.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the point I have is that I listened to people too much and I overthought stocks. I may have sold stocks on emotions too. I also never expected for stocks to rise so high so fast. Yes, I still made money but nowhere near as much as I could have. I had multiple opportunities and I didn&#39;t take them. Now I&#39;m stuck in a position where I don&#39;t want to buy anything because everything is crazy high.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
