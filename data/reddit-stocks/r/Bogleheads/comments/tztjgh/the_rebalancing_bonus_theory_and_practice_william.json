A formula for estimating this excess return is derived and tested. It is demonstrated that assets with high volatility and low correlation with the remainder of the portfolio provide considerable excess return, or \"rebalancing bonus.\"\n\n## Excerpts\n\nThree important questions concerning rebalancing arise:\n\n1. Should rebalancing be done at fixed regular intervals (\"periodically\"), versus whenever the asset mix gets out of kilter by a certain amount (\"threshold rebalancing\")?\n2. If done periodically, what is is the optimum interval (i.e., monthly versus quarterly versus annually)?\n3. Is there a way to predict how much extra return is available from rebalancing, and is it possible to identify assets which provide superior rebalancing benefit?\n\n...\n\nConclusions:\n\n1. The expected return of a rebalanced portfolio is not accurately represented by simple arithmetic weighting of individual asset returns. This is particularly true of assets which have high standard deviations and are poorly correlated. This may be of some importance to those utilizing optimization technology which depends on linear expected return determinations. Standard MVO techniques underestimate the benefit of high variance/low correlation assets.\n2. The capitalization weighting suggested by the CAPM does not appear to be maximally efficient.\n3. A formula is presented which accurately predicts rebalancing benefit. The inputs to this equation are portfolio composition, individual asset standard deviation/variance, and asset pair correlation/covariance. Since these parameters vary with sampling interval, it may be possible to use this formula to predict the optimal rebalancing frequency. Further, the results of the analyses presented suggest that shorter rebalancing intervals may not always be optimal.\n4. Optimizers should understand that sampling interval will significantly affect both input and output data, and that he or she is optimizing only for standard deviatons (or other risk measures, such as semivariance) over a given sampling interval.",
