I’m already in my 40’s but, assuming I stay at my current company until retirement (and then presumably rolling over to an IRA), this would be projected to save me **TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS** in fees PLUS future earnings on that amount - possibly six figures of total savings into old age.\n\nI had a frank conversation with our leadership, arguing first that times have changed and we need to get on the low cost index program to save our employees money, and more recently that in this tight job market it is important to have as competitive a compensation package as possible to attract and retain talent. Well eventually it worked and I had to share here how glad I am now to see it finally happen for me and my co-workers, thanks to what I’ve learned from the Bogleheads over the years. Cheers!",
