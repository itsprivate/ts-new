The obvious conclusion is that bonds belong in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks belong in a taxable account.\n\nWhat surprised me is that $50,000 of stocks in a taxable account will grow to $719,991 after taxes, and $50,000 of stocks in a tax-advantaged account will grow to $654,352 after taxes. Your money goes further in a taxable account than a tax-advantaged account! \n\nI recognize that there's still value in a 401(k) because of the company match. It's free money. However, if your yearly income is below $325,000, you won't be able to take full advantage of a 6% company match. If your income is $100,000, for instance, then your company will match your first $6,000 contribution. **However, your additional $13,500 contribution seems like it's being completely wasted in a 401(k).**\n\nThe common BogleHead advice I see is, after paying off high-interest loans:\n\n1. Contribute to a 401(k) up to company match\n2. Contribute to IRA\n3. Max out 401(k)\n4. Invest in a brokerage fund\n\nBased on these data, it seems that 3 should be avoided all together if you're young and investing mostly in stocks. Am I missing something?\n\nEDIT: Just had a thought. Funneling $50k of stocks through the 401(k) saves you $12,500 on taxes on day one. If invested, this will compound to $218,117 before taxes. Is this the reason that 401(k) are useful?",
