I want you to think it through for yourself.\" He knew his strengths and the things in which he wasn't an expert.\n\nSetting that aside, consider the sources: two men, born in 1929 and 1930, who grew rich and famous because of the US market. They also came of age in the postwar era that provided significant tailwinds for the US and engendered a sense of American exceptionalism. Can't blame folks with a bit of nationalism in 1950s America.\n\n**Jack**'s invention of the 500 index became his claim to fame -- low-cost international index funds didn’t come until much later. For most of his life, it made sense to advocate for US stocks because they were accessible, but that’s no longer the case. The amazing thing he created became the basis for low-cost index funds spanning the whole world.\n\n**Warren** is an American idealist, and possibly the greatest living embodiment of American capitalist success. One would naturally expect him to have some bias toward the US based on that success (despite him owning ex-US stocks, as an aside). It's also really easy to recommend we put most money in a 500 index when he's a billionaire.\n\nBut setting aside their personal contexts, more recent Boglehead authors and researchers from subsequent generations have gone over the data and concluded global diversification is important. Jack's own Vanguard has numerous whitepapers illustrating this point. His 'disciples' like Bernstein, Swedroe and Ferri are pro-international. These are folks he invited to be or approved as Bogleheads reunion speakers starting in the early 2000s.\n\nAll respect to Jack and Warren, but their take is the exception, not the rule. It is a dated perspective. I mean that with no disrespect. Like everyone who ever lived, they were products of their times and experiences. I would encourage you to read more studies and books to get other perspectives. Appealing to the authority of two people who were born 90+ years ago for specific current advice shortchanges your own investment inquiries. Please stay curious.\n\nAnd for anyone who feels inclined to cite their personal recommendations/allocations: please keep in mind Jack was worth nearly $100,000,000, and Buffett, I don't have the energy to type all of his zeros. They both have some good advice, but neither can fully relate to investors with just six or seven figures of invested assets.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- Jack was amazing, and change my financial life, but no one is perfect and situations change. The absolute highlight of my financial life was meeting him and shaking his hand. I owe him so much. But one of his basic principles was low-cost diversification (\"buy the haystack\"). We can do that now globally, so let's go!\n\n**TL;DR** I find a lot of people reference two or three older experts to support anti-international positions. This is just my attempt to put those people and perspectives in context. YMMV. Good luck, whatever you decide.",
