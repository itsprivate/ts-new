He just did a Twitter Space inverview sponsored by Bogleheads which you can hear at  [https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1rmGPgNWXRMKN?s=20](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1rmGPgNWXRMKN?s=20).  It is well worth listening to though the audio was a mess and the interview doesn't start for many minutes into the Twitter space.\n\nWhat was most interesting to me was that Dr. Bernstein emphasizes many times that the safest bond investment is short treasuries which you should buy individually at auction, NOT via a bond ETF with long duration. He makes it clear, as I have believed for years, that the very real duration risk in BND and VTBLX which had been discounted for years is something investors should be more wary about. \n\nTaylor Larimore repeatedly posts how well he has done with a Total Bond index fund type approach since 1983, but that conveniently ignores the fact that total market bond yields have been dropping with a few small blips since 1982 when treasuries were offering mid double digit yields. Dr. Bernstein who is a scholar of the markets points out that the last time we had decades long rising bond rates investors lost something like 75% of the real value of their bonds. That was in the period from the 1940s to 1980. \n\nThe Three Fund Portfolio is NOT what Bogle advocated. It is Taylor Larimore's invention. It has worked very well as long as bond rates have had room to sink. As investors are seeing now, it is one of those beautiful simple concepts that keep people from having to understand what they are doing that works very well until it doesn't.\n\nDr. Bernstein repeatedly made the point that safe fixed income should be safe and that means keeping durations short. He recommends treasury bills, which makes sense as he is a Financial Advisor. He doesn't mention Brokered and direct FDIC and NCUA insured CDs of similar durations, but they are equally well protected by the same US government that stands behind treasuries and a case could be made that direct CDs with competitive rates are a better deal for the fixed income portion of a portfolio for the individual investor as a low Early Withdrawal Penalty is very useful when rates surge.\n\nNo one can give you the secret to the proper way to invest in a few paragraphs. Dr. Bernstein empasized that few people have the ability to study investing enough to be able to manage their own investments because they either don't have the interest in finance, the knowledge of how markets work, or the math skills needed. He said that the people on the Bogleheads forum do have those skills, but suggested they are unaware of how clueless most other people are.  \n\n\nIf you are going to manage your own portfolio will will need to have an interest in finance, a willingness to read and study more than what you see on the internet, some math ability, and emotional control. If that's there, a portfolio of index funds is a simple, inexpensive way to get fine results. But just adopting something like the Three Fund Portfolio because you read convincing sounding arguments on some forum is going to lead to what are called euphemistically, \"Unpredictable results.\"",
