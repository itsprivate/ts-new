I'm pushing him towards Fidelity due to customer service and fractional shares. \n\nHe's a smart kid and willing to put in some work to learn, but I want to make sure I get him some info that is targeted to his age. At first he sounded a little skeptical about investing, but when I explained that you invest in an IRA for the long term, not for 6 months, and then showed him my portfolio history with the dips and gains he was more receptive. \n\nI tried searching through Bogleheads and FinancialIndependence subreddits, plus Google, but I couldn't find anything fitting and useful for a minor starting an IRA. Only articles saying that you can. I know I've seen plenty of posts on here in the past as places to start learning, but I haven't had good success in finding them. Any tips on articles or places to start?\n\nThanks!",
