I am 23 and still new to the investing journey, but I can do it with confidence and less stress thanks to the Bogleheads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to business. Aforementioned I am 23, 14k in ROTH IRA maxed last 2 years, new job 401k w/ 2% match turning on next month. That is all great, here is where it gets dicey. I have no emergency fund, however I live at home with no real risk of losing that. I would still like to potentially move out within 1-2 years. Ideally but unlikely straight to a home with down payment, more likely to an apartment until a down payment can be afforded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to within the next 5 years, explore putting a down payment on a house, and will potentially need to replace my vehicle as it is an 04 SUV, at the same time my family has an extra vehicle available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am open to all advice and would be very grateful, one of my primary questions is should I be building an emergency fund when it doesn't seem like I will have any emergencies that set me back badly thanks to my young age? It seems wasteful when I could be investing into $VT. My thinking is if a true emergency presents itself, I can always take some of what I invested from my Roth IRA. Or, should I instead put it into a non retirement account,( a normal trading account, sorry I do not know lingo) that way it is easier to take out if needed? I haven't maxed my Roth this year but it shouldn't be difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your input, let me know if I can clear any confusion around my post or provide more info.",
