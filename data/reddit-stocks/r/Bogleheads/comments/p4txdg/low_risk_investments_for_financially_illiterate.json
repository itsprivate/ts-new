He left my mom with some cash and she is selling the house I grew up in which has appreciated decently.  She has no IRA’s, 401Ks, or any other retirement vehicles, but after this sale, she’ll have few hundred thousand in cash.  \n\n\nShe knows the error of my fathers ways and wants to give me 100k to setup an account for her in Vanguard and invest in some conservative fund(s).  Capital preservation is really her main goal, as I’ve been telling her inflation is just eating her up every year.  She is an extremely low risk tolerance but I think she’ll be ok with a good fund or set of funds with ~30% allocated to equites.   It’s basically completely in my hands but I’m a little worried about dumping this in the market after the decade + run up we’ve had.   Looking for some ideas on how to invest this.  Sinking it all into Wellesley (VWINX)?  a Target Retirement fund with a date of like 2025 or something?   \n\n\nAppreciate your thoughts and ideas.",
