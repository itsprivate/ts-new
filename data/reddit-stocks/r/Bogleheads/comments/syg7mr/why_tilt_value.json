Once you decide to tilt, you need to stick with that strategy and not bailout of it\n-\tStudy in 1992 By Fama and French – Performance of a broadly diversified US stock portfolio relied on 3 primary risks axis to determine its return. 95% accuracy as to what the portfolio would return\n  - Market risk or Beta – all portfolios move up or down in relation to the total stock market\n  - Percent of small cap in the portfolio by weight – small stocks have higher returns and do not always have correlation to the total stock market\n  - Percent of value orientation – value stocks have a higher return than growth and do not correlate with growth stocks\n-\tSmall cap value index has outperformed growth with less standard deviation from 1979-2009\n  - Having a 50/50 value/growth index during this time added no return and increased standard deviation\n-\tSmall Cap value along with total stock market is a good choice in your portfolio\n\nInvestors Manifesto\n\n-\tGood companies most often are bad stocks, and bad companies (as a group), are good stocks\n-\tAccording to a study by French and Fama at the University of Chicago there are higher returns on value and small cap companies. This study was repeated in developed and emerging markets and the results were the same.\n-\tSo why not own all small value cap stocks??? They can lag the market for long periods of time (10-20 years) and have a high standard deviation.\n-\tThe stocks of small and value companies generally have slightly higher returns than those of the overall market. The effect can be highly variable, as both small and value stocks can underperform for a decade or more\n\n4 Pillars\n\n-\tValue stocks have higher returns than growth stocks. This also works with both US and foreign\n-\t1993 Fuller study showed that popular growth stocks with high P/E ratios increased their earnings 10% faster than the market in year 1, 3% faster in year 2, 2% faster in year 3 and 4 and 1% in years 5 and 6. Eventually their high P/E ratios come down and with it their returns. In other words, you can expect a growth stock to increase its earnings, on average, about 20% more than the market over 6 years.\n-\tExample of above – and why you don&amp;#39;t invest in growth stocks\n  - Smokestack has a P/E of 20 and Glamour has a P/E of 80\n    - For every $100 of Smokestack stock it earns $5. 100/20 = 5\n    - For every $100 of Glamour stock it earns $1.25. 100/80 = 1.25\n    - If SS grows its earnings at 6% for 6 years it will increase earnings by 48% from $5 per share to $7.40 per share\n    - If Glamour grows is earnings 20% faster than the market over 6 years. It will increase earnings by 78%. 1.48 x 1.20 = 1.78. So, its earnings will grow from $1.25 to $2.23. After that it will have the same earnings growth as SS. The market will see the earnings slowing down and clobber its shareholders\n\nThe Young Adult Series\n\n-\tThe market tends to overvalue growth stocks. Good companies are not necessarily good stocks\n-\tA value tilt also provides protection against inflation. This worked in both domestic and international\n-\tEarly adopters reap the initial high returns and low correlations of a novel asset class; then one or more academic and trade journal articles will describe them. Then correlations increase and future returns decrease\n-\tRekenthaler&amp;#39;s Rule – If the bozos know about it, it doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore\n-\tThe once exception to all of this is the value premium. It has stood the test of time\n-\tGrowth companies in general are great companies but are lousy stocks (they are on everyone&amp;#39;s mind)\n-\tWhen growth companies&amp;#39; earnings exceed expectations, their share prices only slightly increased. But when they disappoint, they get clobbered. Value companies are opposite\n-\tValue stocks have a &amp;quot;behavioral&amp;quot; premium as investors undervalue value stocks and overvalue growth stocks\n-\tValue stocks also have a risk premium in that they are more likely to be hurt during a crash and carry a higher risk of bankruptcy than growth stocks.\n-\tBoth the behavioral and risk premium explain value&amp;#39;s excess return over growth in the long run\n-\tOutside of the US, the value/growth dichotomy is the exact same. Value\\&amp;gt;Growth over long term\n-\tYour allocation to various risk assets or factors matters less than your ability to stick with it through thick and thin. Investing is a game won by the most disciplined, not the smartest\n-\tAs more people crowd into various equities, factor, tilts, alternative investments, subsequent returns will be lower than they were in the past\n-\tSmall and value premium still exist. Momentum and quality are new and may have a place in a portfolio. But remember, as you add more factors, you dilute your excess return from each one. And remember that once a factor is discovered, its future returns are reduced.\n\nIAA\n\n-\tStocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy\n-\tBut then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (Growth Stocks)\n-\tLong term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive\n-\tPaul Miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the Dow P/E strategy. He examined buying the 10 lowest P/E stocks in the Dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest P/E stocks (those everyone hates) actually outperformed the market and the highest P/E stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed\n-\tDreman has observed that &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; stocks tend to fall less in price than &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; stocks when earnings disappoint. Conversely, &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; stocks tend to rise more in price than &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; stocks when earnings exceed expectations.\n-\tTo put it another way, good companies are generally bad stocks, and bad companies are generally good stocks\n-\tIt has puzzled academics EMH theorists why these value type strategies have worked so well for so long even after they were discovered. (The market should have arbitrated this away long ago). The reason the strategies still work is that cheap companies are dogs, and most people cannot bring themselves to buy them. This concept is very difficult for investors and money managers alike.\n-\tThe best explanation for value stocks can be found in Robert Haugen The New Finance: The Case Against Efficient Markets. In 1993 the highest 20% P/E stocks (Growth) had an average P/E of 42. Earnings yield was 2.36% or 1/42. The lowest 20% P/E stocks (Value) had a P/E of 12. Earnings yield was 8.38% or 1/12. So, if you bought growth stocks in 1993, you received $2.36 for every $100 invested. If you bought value stocks then, you received $8.38 in earnings for every $100 invested. That means growth stocks earnings have to grow 3x larger than value stocks just to break even. The growth stocks did have higher earnings than value, but not enough to catch up.\n-\tBoth the behavioral (people don&amp;#39;t like buying bad companies) and increased risk (companies are not in great financial shape) explain value companies higher returns than growth.\n-\tValue companies tend to do better than growth during bear markets\n\nComplete Guide to Factor Based Investing\n\n-\tFactors are characteristics of stock and securities that explain performance and provide premiums\n-\tFactors are not guaranteed to work, that is why they have a premium. You might go 20+ years and have a negative return from these factors. Some have higher chances of success than other but you must have discipline. If they worked all the time, they wouldn&amp;#39;t have a risk premium\n-\t6 factors meet the below criteria – Beta, Size, Value, Momentum, Profitability, Quality\n-\tBeta explains 2/3 of the portfolios return. Add size and value factors and you get to 90%. Add momentum, profitability and quality and it is in the mid 90&amp;#39;s\n-\tAfter a factor is discovered, the premium it delivers is reduced by 1/3 on average as more investors go into that factor. But they still have risk premiums.\n-\tValue – relatively cheap assets tend to outperform relatively expensive ones\n  - Value premium is 4.8%\n-\tYou can have a total market fund as a &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; then add satellite positions in funds with exposure to factors in which you want to tilt\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t think about your factor tilts in isolation, think about the whole portfolio\n-\tThe more factors you have, the less utility each one will provide. You get diminishing returns.\n-\tFor most investors – Beta, Size and Value are enough factor tilts.\n\nStocks for the Long Run\n\n-\tF+F also determined that value played a role in returns. Stocks with low prices relative to their fundamentals are value stocks. Stocks with high prices relative to their fundamentals are growth stocks\n-\tIn 1978 Ramaswamy and Litzenberger established a significant correlation between dividend yield and subsequent return. O&amp;#39;Shaughnessy has shown that in the period of 1951-1994, the 50 highest dividend yielding large cap stocks had a return that was 1.7% higher than the market\n-\tBasu did some studies in the 1960&amp;#39;s that showed that stocks with lower P/E ratios have significantly higher returns than stocks with high P/E ratios, even after accounting for risks\n-\tHistorical returns on value stocks have surpassed the returns on growth stocks and this is especially true with smaller cap stocks. As market cap increases, the difference between value and growth becomes smaller.\n-\tGrowth and Value stocks can and do change designations. For example, technology which is historically a growth industry, could be classified as a value stock if it is out of favor with investors and sells at a low price relative to fundamentals\n-\tHistorical research shows that investors can achieve higher long-term returns without taking on increased risk by focusing on the factors relating to the valuation of companies\n-\tBe aware though that no strategy will outperform the market all the time. You must be patient if you employ these strategies\n-\tThere is a negative correlation between economic growth and stock returns. This occurs in both developing and developed markets. Why? Same reason value stocks beat growth stocks. Valuation. The faster growing economics have a higher price.\n-\tExample – China is the world&amp;#39;s fastest growing economy currently, but investors in China have realized poor returns because of overvaluation. Latin America has been a better investment for the same reasons Exxon was a better investment over the last 50 years then IBM.\n\nArticles\n\nWhat has Worked in Investing (Why Value investing works) - https://tweedy.com/resources/library_docs/papers/WhatHasWorkedFundOct14Web.pdf",
