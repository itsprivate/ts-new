The problem is that because Vanguard does not allow you to purchase partial shares of ETFs, it seems like you'll be left with an annoying amount of money remaining in cash when you rebalance.  My question is a three-parter:\n\n1. How does one convert an entire portfolio of mutual funds into ETFs at Vanguard? Is it simply a matter of selling all of them at once, and then the next day, buying their equivalents in ETFs? \n2. I have a plan to rebalance whenever my portfolio gets out-of-whack by a certain set percentage.  Rebalancing with mutual funds is easy; it's a simple buy/sell transfer to the nearest cent.  With ETFs, if my stocks got overly bloated, do I sell a whole number of shares of VTI, and then buy up as many shares of BND as I can, and simply accept that a small chunk over will just sit there as cash?  \n3.  I know Fidelity allows purchases of partial shares, so I'm assuming rebalancing is easier with them. I already have a growing HSA with Fidelity.  Is this a terrible reason to do a big rollover, though?\n\nAppreciate hearing your thoughts, friends.",
