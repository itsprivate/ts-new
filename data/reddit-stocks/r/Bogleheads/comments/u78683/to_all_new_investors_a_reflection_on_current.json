Here is some reflection on these events:\n\n**Is it a good time to invest?** Yes it is always a good time to invest. As has been proven over and over again, time in the market is the greatest benefit for investors, just ask [Bob](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/).\n\n**But what about \\[insert news story here\\]?** Here is a list of things (mostly US centered) that have happened since January 1, 2000: Bush v Gore, 9/11, dot com bubble/recession, two different wars that have lasted longer than a decade, anthrax attacks, Great Recession, the \"lost decade\" (2000-2010), Jan 6 insurrection, Covid shutting the world down, introduction of smart phones, social media, Brexit, 5 different Presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden), gay marriage becoming legal across the US, 17 different people have served on the Supreme Court (I'm counting Ketanji Brown Jackson, since she has been confirmed), rise of China, people predicting the world will end \"soon\".\n\nAs you can see there has been a lot of things that have happened, both good and bad, and the US and the World have survived, and provided great returns over the past 20ish years. No matter when we look, there were always be stories that make it seem like \"this time is different,\" but yet the world's economy just keeps moving on with an upward trajectory.\n\n**I can't handle the current downward trend in my portfolio, what should I do?** I have 3 things to say to you:\n\n1. Take a break from looking at your portfolio/news. Take a vacation.\n2. Remember we are \"long term investors.\" Even someone who retires at 65 can still have 20-30 years of investing before they die, and even longer if they want to leave an inheritance.\n3. Rethink your asset allocation. If you feel that this current trend is still too much for you to handle, you may be too aggressive with your assets. Look into holding bonds (BND, BNDW, I bonds, GOVT). Now when the markets start to rebound, don't ditch your bond allocation (remember you added bonds for a reason). If you are worried about rising interest rates and bonds, read [this](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=360575).\n\n**How long will this downward trend continue?** I have no idea. It may end next week or two years from now (the S&amp;P had [3 consecutive years of negative returns in 2000, 2001, and 2002](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns)). The best thing to do is to stick to your [investment policy statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement).\n\n**But inflation.** Well, yes it is high. However, inflation was bad back in the mid 70s to 80s also (10+%). I have yet to see an \"updated\" version to BuisnessWeek's August 13, 1979 article \"[The Death of Equities: How Inflation is Killing the Stock Market](https://ritholtz.com/1979/08/the-death-of-equities/)\" (there have been updates, stating that equities have been great since then). The stock market has done pretty well over the past 40+ years.\n\nWe also don't have [WIN buttons](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/museum/artifactcollectionsamples/catagories/win/buttona.html) yet (yes that was a thing back in the 70s).\n\n**TLDR:** Stay the course, and don't get distracted from the fact that today's news will have little effect on your portfolio years down the road.",
