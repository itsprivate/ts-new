It's frequently recommended to have a stock/bond ratio of 60/40, 70/30, 80/20 etc but I rarely see anyone recommend a 100% stock allocation. After everything I've read, I don't see any advantage in holding any bond allocation in my portfolio at least until I am ready to retire and live on a fixed income. Bond index funds do not grow at the rate that equities do and for the next 30 years growth is what I need most. Any money set aside for bonds will just create drag. This argument is made pretty clearly in the book \"The Simple Path to Wealth\". \n\nThe only downside I see is volatility, but so what? What if I just stay the course? I'm fine with my portfolio dropping 50% if I'm not planning on selling for another 30 years. \n\nIs there something I'm missing? Can anyone point to a study or a paper somewhere that says an 80/20 or 90/10 portfolio will outperform a 100 percent stock portfolio in the long run?\n\nThanks!",
