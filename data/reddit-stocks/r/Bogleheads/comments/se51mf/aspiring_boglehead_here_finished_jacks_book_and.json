Heres where I am asking for this community's help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a background and family with zero financial literacy. I am 25 and have saved about 300k, and hoping to invest 250k. I have met with JP Morgan, Edward Jones, and Fidelity but I dont like their structures due to high rates of transactions, and annual fees. Looking at this subreddit it seems like a common strategy is to have a trio of accounts for diversification. I know that buying now during a dip wont matter over the course of 30 years. But I want to get into the market ASAP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What Vanguard/Non-Vanguard accounts and balancing do you recommend for a risk averse portfolio of 250k with a target retirement date of 2060?\n2. TLH, is this something I should be immediately trying to do, not trying to do, or look into in the future?\n3. Should I invest all at once, or phase in my investments over the course of months or years?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THANK YOU SO MUCH, INTERNET LEGENDS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nI also have a 401k that I use to mainly track the S&amp;P, and max that out every year for the last two years.",
