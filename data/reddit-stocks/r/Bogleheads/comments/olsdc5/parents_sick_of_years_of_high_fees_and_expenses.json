Both are in their late 50's and hope to retire in less than ten years. Looking over their statements, I was surprised to find that their advisor has almost  all of their money in two funds: American Funds The Income Fund of America Class A (AMECX) and Invesco Equity and Income Fund Class C (ACERX). I found that both have high expense ratios (.57% and   1.54% respectively, while AMECX also has a front load fee of 5.75%). After backtesting both funds against the closest Vanguard equivalent I could find (VEIPX) it was no shocker that a theoretical investment in the Vanguard fund would have run circles around the other two over the years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter looking into it more, I decided to go with them to their next meeting with their advisor. As relatively passive investors, they had been more or less blindly trusting their advisor to make investment decisions for them for years. They were under the impression that their advisor was offered as a free service for being with their bank and were unaware that he and his company are compensated with a portion of the fees charged by their funds. When asking the advisor to provide a data-backed driven as to why my parents should stay with their current investments rather than moving over to low cost Vanguard funds, he offered some mumbo jumbo about \"the value of active management\". I'm not knocking him for doing his job, and I understand that his goal is ultimately to provide revenue for his company while at the same time providing investment advice for my parents. However, it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth as I feel it's pretty obvious his main goal is to bring in profit rather than suggesting funds that will maximize their return. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter bringing up these concerns to my parents, they are willing to listen to alternatives. They have a lot invested (nearly $1,000,000 between all of their accounts) and were surprised to see just how much high expense ratios and advisor fees can drag down their gains over time. My question to all fellow Bogleheads is this: What would you do if you were in their situation? This is money that they want to grow for at least the next 10 years as they move towards retirement and want to be as passive as possible. I would be helping out with any rebalancing and doing most of the leg work for them.  Initially I am leaning towards recommending a Vanguard target retirement date fund (nice and simple) or a 3 or 4 fund portfolio with a higher allocation towards bonds. Any advice is appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My parents have been getting charged crazy high expense ratios and fees on their nest egg for years. As they approach retirement, they have asked me to recommend alternatives. What would you do?",
