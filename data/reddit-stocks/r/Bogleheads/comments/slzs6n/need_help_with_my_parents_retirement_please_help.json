They will be on Social security benefits.\n\n\\&gt; My parents and I came to America in 2008. I believe they were in their mid 40 or 50s at that time.\n\n\\&gt; My parents have mortgage. They will pay it off in 2 to 3 years. My parents can pay it off early nextyear using my allowance money and saving + some of my parents money. Mortgage min payment is $709 include escrow (homeowner insurance and property tax). We make additional principal balance $293ish to total is $1000/month. 4.5% fixed interest rate for 10 years loan term, but we will pay it off before that. We refinance in 2020.\n\n\\&gt; My parents will pass the house to me once I become independent and able to take care of myself. I will also help them with monthly bills. I am 23 btw.\n\n\\&gt; I am thinking open up my parents roth ira right now then contribute as much as well for 2021. Next year, pay off early the mortgage then Roth IRA. Money will go into SP 500.\n\nBoth my parents income $39k. \n\nAnyone has better plan and advice? Please help.",
