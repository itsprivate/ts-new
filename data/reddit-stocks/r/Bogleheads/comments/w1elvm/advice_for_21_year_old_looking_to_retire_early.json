Currently making ~200K a year with no debt and looking for some advice on what more I could be doing to help me retire early.\n\nAs of now, I am maxing out pre-tax 401K (currently at $40K), investing 19K a year to after tax 401K and rolling over to Roth IRA (mega backdoor). I am also investing about ~20K a year into S&amp;P 500. What more should I look to do to help me achieve my goal of retiring in the next 25 years? Would appreciate any advice.",
