  "selftext": "Hey, thanks for having me.\n\nI'm a new, mid-20s investor who comes from a risk-averse upbringing. I've put $10k in to Series I-bonds and around $7k into 70/30 US/international index funds (VOO/VXUS, and the Fidelity ZERO funds). I have another $7k in an HYSA while the I-bonds are locked away until next year. My safety net is practically much larger because my family is happy to help pay off any expenses exceeding this, but of course I don't want to rely on them. I'm adding a recurring $500/month to a Roth IRA and whatever I have left over (shooting for $500/month) into a taxable account. I have no plans to purchase any more bonds until my overall portfolio becomes 80/20 stocks/bonds; I feel like I-bonds dual as both a bond allocation and an emergency fund. I don't think I have access to a 401(k) as a graduate student.\n\nI understand this is a conservative allocation for my age group and goals (more interest in wealth accumulation, less interest in retirement), but anything is better than hoarding everything in a 0.01% APY bank in comparison. Nominal returns are more important to me than real returns in this sense, hence the decision to go with I-bonds.\n\nMy biggest concern is riding out market turbulence, for example whenever the next market crash happens. The automatic $500/month IRA deposit shouldn't be affected unless I disable it, but I worry I'll be turned off to investing in the future. For example, I might stop purchasing ETFs in my taxable account, or I might make poor, emotional 401(k) decisions when that time comes. I'd like passive investing to be a lifestyle instead of something I did in my youth because it was en vogue. To this end I've been learning as much as I can in hopes that understanding what I'm doing will help me stay the course.\n\nAre there any stats on \"retention rates\" among active and passive investors? Is there anything about investors cutting back on their deposits as opposed to increasing them during bear markets? I recall some anecdote about mid-40s investors with families being most prone to withdraw their investments, for example. Is there any data about this by age group, income, or other demographics? What percentage of their income do Americans save for retirement, and does this change by age/income/generation? Is there anywhere I could read more about \"staying the course stats\"? I know that this business isn't easy on the mind, but I was hoping that being informed by data will make it more likely to survive the next extended bear market.",
