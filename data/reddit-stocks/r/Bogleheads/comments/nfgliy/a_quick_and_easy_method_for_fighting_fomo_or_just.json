I blame my parents. </p>\n\n<p>Lots of threads here about FOMO over doge coin and other nonsense. Just wanted to provide a mental hack I came up with.</p>\n\n<p>This past January, I watched the news with a pit in my stomach. Rona cases rising, panic over the events on 1/6/21, contested election, national guard in DC, George Floyd decision outstanding, and coronavirus cases rising. </p>\n\n<p>By the way did you hear cases are rising? And there are variant strains? Also, evictions are going down and the housing market is surely about to crash, valuations can&#39;t stay so high. Did you hear that cases are rising? And then GME nonsense went down and I thought, DAMN, totally overvalued! Shoe shine boy is giving stock tips, it&#39;s the end of times!</p>\n\n<p>I was about to pull my money out of the market (some target date funds) and throw it all in bonds. Surely, I thought, the crash is coming. Instead, I remembered to not panic. I calmed my tits. I set a reminder in my calendar for the middle of March. I would wait and see and then make a decision then. </p>\n\n<p>March came. The world had not ended. In fact, the market was on a huge run. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: When you start to panic about your investments, set a calendar reminder in a few weeks. Name it something like, &quot;I think the market will be at X on this date&quot;. See if you were right. Chances are that you were incorrect in your assessment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
