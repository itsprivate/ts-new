All is not lost, compared to what I would have been invested in before they took over the difference in the return is -.66 over 5 years not including the management fee they assessed. \n\nI spoke with the gentleman yesterday I told him my case for why I wanted to end the managed account service and he generally agreed with me and told me it sounds like I have done my research and he feels comfortable that I will be fine on my own. He did mention I am welcome back anytime lol.\n\nWell in the past year I have cleaned up my financial life and started taking an active approach in saving, investing and all things generally finance. I have started a Roth IRA with vanguard, maxed out 2021 and am on track to max out 2022. I follow the idea of a 3 fund lazy portfolio of VTI, VXUS, BND. \n\nI noticed the funds that they have me invested in generally follow this also although in different allocations than I would like from the research that I did. \n\nSo with out further delay here is what I have/had and what I would like to do. Any input is appreciated. Disclaimer - the four funds I chose are all the vanguard funds they offer through my 401k. There are I believe 8 other funds other than target dates all with exceptionally higher expense ratios. \n\nThe latest allocation they have me in \n\n\\- VINIX (S&amp;P 500) 36% @.03 expense ratio\n\n\\- VTSNX (Total Int.) 32% @ .08 expense ratio\n\n\\- VIEIX (Small/Mid Cap) 19% @ .05 expense ratio\n\n\\- PRCPB (Prudential Bond) 13% @ .11 expense ratio\n\nIf my math is correct the total expense ratio is roughly .06. The kicker is the \"management\" fee was .45! So a total of .51?\n\nMy plan is as follows\n\n\\- VINIX (S&amp;P 500) 56% @ .03 expense ratio\n\n\\- VIEIX (Small/Mid Cap) 14% @ .05 expense ratio\n\n**The plan for these two are to recreate Vanguards total market with a roughly 80% allocation to S&amp;P 500 and 20% to small and mid cap. Last check this is roughly what VTI is.** \n\n\\- VTSNX (Total Int) 20% @.08 expense ratio\n\n\\- VBTIX ( Total Bond) 10% @ .03 expense ratio\n\nIf my math is correct this would be about a .04 expense ratio or roughly a savings of .47!\n\nIf it helps I am 31 years old and intend to retire at 62. I carry no debt, I rent, I have 6 months cash for bills, a 2015 civic with 70K miles payed off and also have a defined benefit pension at work. I contribute 15% to my 401k. And have a seperate savings account for hobbies. \n\nI hope I gave enough information for a thorough picture and didn't fill the post with too much unnecessary information.",
