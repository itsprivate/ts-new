Let's also say that you are debt free.  \nWould it make sense to take the excess cash and just rinse and repeat Bogle's formula in a taxable trading account? Another Index Fund? Or, would it make more sense to purchase bonds or REIT's or something like that in a taxable trading account? It doesn't even need to be a trading account, maybe that's not even the right thing to do. I'm just speculating here. What are your thoughts?",
