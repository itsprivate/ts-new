She has become a high income earner in the last 5ish years (200k+), but is naturally very frugal (lives on probably 35k and has a paid off home). She has about 1mil between her 401k and cash (I think she's cash heavy at like $200k). She likes to be hands-off with investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, she was worried she did not have enough in retirement. She thought she only had about 500k. I was very nervous for her and urged her to talk to a financial advisor to help her consolidate and make a plan for her money since she's so close to retirement. I gave her websites for fee-based fiduciaries and Vanguard services, but I didn't want to push too hard 'cause I'm still a layman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, she ended up figuring out she actually had about 1 mil, and went with an Edward Jones advisor that her friend recommended and I am so scared this person is mismanaging her portfolio. She told me the other day when the market dipped, that she \"lost\" like 30k and her advisor said not to worry cause \"she'd move some things around\". Pretty sure some of her investments were in Fidelity in her 401k. I tried to look at her EJ portfolio but it was confusing and we were multitasking but I saw there were a lot of single stock picks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR/Questions: Mom's advisor is Edward Jones. Portfolio is 1 mil. I don't trust them - worried they have her invested very aggressively so late in the game. Not sure if I'm overreacting.**\n\n1. **How would you guys manage your portfolio if you were a 62yr old high income earner with 5 more years of work?** I can try to get more info on her portfolio if that's necessary.\n2. **Am I being dramatic?** Will her level of spending vs. income and proximity to retirement protect her? Is she at risk of an advisor destroying her wealth or should I just let her be and try not to stress my mom out?\n3. **Has anyone used Vanguards financial services?** She knows I'm interested in finance and FIRE, and trusts my judgement, but I'm scared to give her recommendations to do what I would do, because I'm still learning.",
