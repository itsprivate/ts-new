As an investor from Vietnam, a frontier market, I became tired of hearing about \"riding the wave\" and my friends lamenting numerous rug pulls in the stock market. By chance, I discovered this little thing called \"index investing\" on Reddit.\n\nAfter reading the recommended materials by Bogleheads, skipping US-specific topics like IRA, it turns out that I can't entrust Interactive Brokers with my S&amp;P500 ETF shares for 30 years. Vietnamese law does not protect investing with a international broker, and there's no domicile S&amp;P500 fund either, so domestic market is the only option.\n\nNext I joined a large Vietnamese Facebook investing group with 500k members to look for anything related to index investing. Searching \"Bogle\" yielded a single translated article on recommended books for investor (guess which one?). Searching E1VFVN30 (largest ETF fund in our country, large-cap, 96% foreign-owned) returned 1 or 2 guys DCAing into the fund in only 3 years with 50% gain. Positive signs, but a large+midcap ETF just opened, isn't it better to diversify?\n\nThen I try to find international analogues: I lurk at r/IndiaInvestments to see how investors there adapt, and it is actually upside down: large and mid-cap indices are much preferred over total market. But they got domicile SP500 fund too, so it's not a perfect fit. \n\nUltimately there wasn't much homework to do for a non-professional like me, so I just bit the bullet and allocate:\n\n* 80% large-cap E1VFVN30 ETF. Vietnam's large cap is very bank (40%) and real estate(22%) heavy. Mid-cap is more diversified, but bank and real estate still take up &gt;50%.\n* 20% corporate bond fund. Corporate bond because no individual investors would buy government bond, they'd rather use savings account, the return is higher and it isn't taxed here. Fund because there's no public credit rating.\n\nFor now, it's a traditional bond% = age allocation due to the perceived risk here. Technically, I'm 100% on frontier market, and many Bogleheads here hold such investment only above crypto. The market is also too young, ETF only exists for 8 years. Although being a Bogleheads here is much more unease than a developed market, at least now I'm more diversified than a guy throwing borrowed money into penny stocks or stuck with a plot of land from Bumfuck village. \n\nWhat's your experience as a Boglehead in developing countries?",
