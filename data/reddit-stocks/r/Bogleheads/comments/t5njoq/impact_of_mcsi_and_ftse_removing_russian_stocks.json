Please try to keep responses to my post about the mechanics of what will go on with the indexes and the funds that track them.\n\nBoth MCSI and FTSE Russell have announced that they'll be removing all Russian equities from their indexes next week (at the close on the 9th and the open on the 7th respectively).   Since VTI and VT (and others) track an FTSE index, and there are other international \"boglehead\" funds that track MCSI indexes, I'm curious what this is likely to do to the ticker price/NAV/index value as of those dates.\n\nOn the index side it sounds like at least FTSE will be removing these stocks at a \"zero value\", which I'm guessing means that the index should drop by whatever residual value of the Russian stocks are.   (Looks like perhaps 0.3% of VXUS as of a few days ago).\n\nI'm also curious about what happens with the Russian stocks which are currently held by the ETF/Mutual Fund, especially since it isn't going to be easy to dispose of them.   Do they just stay in the assets of the fund until such time as they can dispose of them or write them off as worthless?",
