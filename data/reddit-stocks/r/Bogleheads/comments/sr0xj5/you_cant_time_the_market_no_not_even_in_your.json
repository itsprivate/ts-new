Now is not any more special than a year ago or a decade ago. So to the person who is about to make a post asking if they should time the market the answer is no. Should you DCA? Perhaps, if it will help you feel better about investing your large amount of money. That is a perfectly acceptable strategy especially if the alternative is to not invest any money.

Feel free to start a discussion about how you debunked this. Boglehead investing might also not be for you and that is also fine. If you are really insistent that you have the secret sauce and can time the market I congratulate you. You can probably sell this secret for such a large amount of money that you won't even need to invest and can retire tomorrow. \n\nBut if you are expecting people to answer your question about timing the market with anything other than no, I think you will be disappointed.\n\nFor more info about Boglehead philosophy please read this and other pages on the wiki: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy",
