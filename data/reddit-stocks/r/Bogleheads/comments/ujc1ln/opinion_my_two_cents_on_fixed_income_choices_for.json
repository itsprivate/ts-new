Anyway, here goes:\n\n1) Don't time the market. It rarely ends well. Really. This is true for bonds, too.\n\n2) Keep stock-like risk on the stock side, which is to say: stick to safe government bonds when possible.\n\n3) Consider owning (real return) bonds that hedge inflation as well as (nominal) bonds that hedge deflation.\n\n4) Unless you enjoy that kind of thing, don't bother directly buying Treasuries or TIPS -- it's a hassle.\n\n5) Unless you have a strong and persistent reason (i.e. not based on recent performance) to modify your duration, 'intermediate' offers a good balance of risk/reward -- you get some reward for going out a bit on the yield curve, but don't have as much volatility and interest rate risk as long bonds. The downside of going *short* is not just the lower expected returns, but also reinvestment risk (i.e. the risk that when your short bonds mature, rates will be lower again, and you'll be forced to buy in at those newly lower rates). There are arguments for deviate from this default, but if you're just not sure where to start, this is a good neutral position.\n\n**So, what does this mean in practice?** One reasonable default for the safety inclined (on the fixed income side of one's portfolio) would be 50/50 nominal/real-return government bonds. For example, 50/50 intermediate Treasuries/TIPS, held in funds (and: Series EE and I bonds in taxable accounts if you have space available -- think of EE bonds like an illiquid 20-year Treasury, and I bonds like a flexible TIPS bond for 1 to 30 years).\n\n*P.S. You won't go terribly wrong with a Total Bond fund. It's fine. It's got a lot of Treasuries, and the rest of what's in there is basically high-quality corporates. It might not provide quite the same level of protection in a crash, but it does have a higher expected long-term return. So it depends, in part, on how you view your portfolio. I take the view that correlations matter, and would prefer my bonds to generally protect during a serious recession. YMMV.*",
