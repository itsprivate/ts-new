But... looking at it - it seems we might have chosen the wrong Index fund - FZILX. I just looked at it over the last 5Y and it only grew 20ish % over that period while for example FSPSX grew 37% and DJI a staggering 85%. So... am I really supposed to not look at the gigantic differences between previous performances between the funds because they're not good predictors for future performance? Do I just stubbornly stay with FZILX?\n\n I'm 39 and she's 32. Looking for good numbers by my retirement age.",
