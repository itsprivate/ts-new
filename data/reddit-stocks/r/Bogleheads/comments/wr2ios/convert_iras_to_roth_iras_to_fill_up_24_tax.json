  "selftext": "So, we're retired, early 50s. Have $1.5M in traditional IRAs. The plan is to convert as much as we can annually to Roth IRAs to fill up the fed tax bracket of 24% every year until there is no more Trad IRA funds. It'll take about 10 years.\n\nWe'll be able to pay the tax bills with after-tax funds. After that, our income is not zero, but with after-tax dividends and a few other minor sources of income, we'll be at a much lower tax bracket once we're done converting our IRAs.\n\nWhy not stretch it out for 20 years (or beyond) instead of 10 years? Because I'm afraid general tax rates will be going up much faster than inflation in the next 20 years. Having no traditional IRA assets in 2030 and beyond will be a great, freeing feeling. Even if we do end up paying a bit 'too much' in the next 10 years, I think it's worth the risk of overpaying for the peace of mind of having only Roth IRAs and after-tax accounts to draw from. Our SWR will be very low.\n\nWe live in a pretty high tax state. Will probably 'always' live in a high-tax state.\n\nAny issues you see with us doing this?  What would you do if you were me?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldntpkkjqci91.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2d086d0c6e6352666d3f4f78ea92c5196c7e66c",
