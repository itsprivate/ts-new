After a few months of studying (and lately lurking here) and having Vanguard/Fidelity + TDF/3-Fund portfolio analysis paralysis I just went with a Vanguard Roth IRA last night.  I put in the $1000 I saved up (for the VFORX minimum).  \n\nThis morning I have a sick feeling in my stomach.  I should have gone with Fidelity I think.  I am a low income worker, 51, my 6 mo's EF is saved, and there is not a 401k offered at my current job.  I think the ability to buy fractional shares, the possibility of using the Zero funds, and the much better phone app (I don't have a computer right now) at Fidelity would be better for a lower income investor.  Agree, disagree?\n\n1. Right now my $1000 is \"settling\", (I think) and isn't available to transfer anywhere (yet)?  Once it settles, how do I get it out of Vanguard and over to Fidelity? I haven't bought any funds at Vanguard yet.  \n\n2. I feel shaky about Vanguard also, because of the class action lawsuit against them regarding the TDF issue.  It doesn't concern me directly of course, but  they either made a big mistake or they did something shady, it seems like.  Probably the former, but neither scenario inspires confidence for me today.  Is it anything to be concerned about?\n\n3. Zero funds for 3-fund portfolio?  Stay put at Vanguard?  Vanguard EFTs for 3-fund?  What percentages would you recommend? Or a TDF?  I've got analysis paralysis really bad!\n\nI'm very late to this, but I'm hoping to \"retire\" at 70, in 18 ish years.  So, I know I have to make up for lost time, but from this queasy feeling today clearly my risk tolerance isn't super high!  But, Dave Ramsey insists this the next step to building wealth, so I'm trying!  I don't have a lot of money so I need to be wise, and I have zero experience with investing.  I am great at being very frugal and saving money.  It took me 19 years to pay off my student loan though, my biggest financial mistake was that loan.  As a primarily blue collar worker I didn't need a university degree, though I did finish it, but it has not had a good ROI for me at all.  Dumb with zeros on the end, as Dave says.  I just finished paying it off in January and am completely debt free now.  I am also starting a sinking fund for a down payment.  All insights/mentoring on what to do next is appreciated.\n\nThank you.",
