I have seen people here say they put 20% of their portfolio in crypto.\n\nI know I may be under Dunning Kruger effect so tell me if  I am wrong.\n\nI will only consider Bitcoin. I know there are many other cryptocurrencies but they are less established.\n\nBy dollar, here I mean US dollar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Argument**\n\nI was reading about how a high dollar value will make American products more expensive overseas, which reduces the demand for American exports. It makes me think, if crypto became the mainstream currency in a country, that country's goods would become so expensive that the demand on their exports would tank. This would then tank their economy. I suspect countries may outlaw the use of cryptocurrency to prevent this. Some large countries such as Russia and China have already taken partial steps to outlaw cryptocurrency.\n\nIf crypto does not become the mainstream currency in any country, then crypto is more like a speculation than legitimate currency. However, unlike other speculation like antiques, art, real estate, etc. crypto has no inherent value.\n\nI think there is a futuristic bias with cryptocurrency: it is heavily invested in because people think it is the future. Unlike stocks which have benefited from futuristic bias, like Tesla, cryptocurrency is just currency- it doesn't have growth/earnings potential.\n\nUnlike currency such as gold, cryptocurrency can't be converted into jewelry, statues, etc. Gold seems similar to cryptocurrency in that it has a fairly limited supply, whereas the dollar is \"pretend\". As far as I know, no country currently uses the gold standard. Today economies run on \"pretend\" money which seems to work pretty well.\n\nI did some calculations to show that crypto is hundreds of times more variable compared to real currencies. Also, its value is steadily increasing compared to other currencies, which seems very concerning to me. Real world currencies, as far as I know, don't behave this way unless an economy is collapsing.\n\nI think the only way Bitcoin would be sustainable is if there was more inflation, but the algorithms are designed to prevent this.\n\nI think a R\\^2 test against the null hypothesis might be a better calculation, but I'm not sure how to do this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Calculations**\n\nThe dollar/euro exchange rate from 1981-2021 has varied from around 0.63-1.54.
