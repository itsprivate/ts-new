Plus by investing directly in federal treasuries you don't have to pay state income tax on the interest. I don't know why I didn't do this before and why I've had a high yield savings account for so long. It seems to me like a no brainer to do short term treasury bills instead of high yield savings accounts. Obviously I-bonds are better, but more illiquid with the initial 1-year lockup so not appropriate for all emergency funds.",
