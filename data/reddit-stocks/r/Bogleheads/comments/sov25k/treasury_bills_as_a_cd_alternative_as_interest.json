Of course, look into Series I Savings Bonds and high-yield savings accounts first.\n\nThe US Treasury auctions a 52-week bill once per month. Instead of paying interest separately, the bill is sold at a discount. In January, the yield was 0.642%, so at that yield, in exchange for $993.63 now the government will pay you back $1000 in a year.\n\nThe issue is that while we won't know the February yield until the auction on February 22, as of today the 1-year yield was 0.91%, which is favorable compared to a 1-year CD. The bonus is that the interest is exempt from state income tax, so if your state income tax rate is 8%, you're effectively getting 0.99% on the bill.\n\nYou can buy them at auction through a \"noncompetitive bid\" either in your TreasuryDirect account that you created for buying Series I bonds, or for no commission at Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab. You should expect to hold them to maturity, as you might lose some principal if you sell early in a brokerage account, and at TreasuryDirect you can't sell them at all.\n\nTreasuryDirect lets you choose to reinvest the bill at maturity, and you get a refund between its value and the purchase price of a new bill deposited into your bank account. I was doing this back in 2018/2019. In December 2018 the 52-week yield even got up to about 2.74%. If you buy a 52-week bill every month for a year and then set up the reinvestments, you've created a \"ladder\" where you get interest deposited in your bank account every month, and also have the option to shut off the reinvestment if you need the principal back to spend that month.\n\nOf course, you should read up about how Treasury Bills work on the TreasuryDirect site before buying anything.",
