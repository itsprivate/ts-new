I did a Reddit deep dive and ended up in the Boglehead community and have spent hours reading posts and my knowledge has increased exponentially. But, I think I have a bit of information overload. \n\nI would love to get some feedback on this financial outline I made for myself moving forward. I apologize if this post is too lengthy, I don't really post to Reddit much. A quick background on myself: I am a 26-year-old newlywed and new father. I have a Roth IRA with Schwab currently invested in the 2065 Target Index fund and I have a good amount of individual stocks in some great companies gifted to me by family when I was very young (ie Apple, Amazon, Tesla, etc). I don't know a ton about investing and I love the idea of keeping things very simple and being as hands-off as possible. Here is my current plan/ where my head is at. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Roth IRA - I am going to prioritize maxing that out every year and leave it set to my target-date fund (hopefully get my wife set up and maximize hers as well) \n\n2. Brokerage account - I think my individual stocks are good enough and I don't want to worry about picking more individual stocks. Now, I am going to start taking my extra money and money from friends/ family and put it towards VT (I decided on VT over VTI + VXUS) so that I have a diversified portfolio and can just let it build with little thought. \n\n3. With any money from friends/ family that wanna help my son, I’m either going to start a 529 or just put that money toward the VT and just gift him stocks once he’s old enough/ use my stocks/ Roth IRA to pay for his college. \n\nThoughts on if I’m missing anything or should not do any of that. I have money set aside to put into VT should the market crash. I just want to make sure I have my thought going in the right direction and am not missing out on anything important.  Any input is gladly appreciated and hopefully, this can help someone else in my same situation.",
