I'm 37 and plan to provide myself with some DIY-pension plan, so my time horizon is around 25 years. I want to allocate my assets like 30% bonds and 70% stocks. The situation is - I live in Germany and can not just \"copy-paste\" an advice from the book, therefore some questions:\n\n1. I don't really understand the long term strategy with buy-and-hold approach. Let's say, I've bought some accumulating fund, I keep investing in this fund monthly for 30 years, finally I decided to start using the profit. How I do that? - Do I reinvest it in distributing assets to start getting dividends? Or I start to sell my assets in some portions, for example, once a year to spend this money until the next \"withdrawal\"?\n2. What means \"domestic funds\" from Bogleheads' philosophy perspective? - Should I prefer German funds or \"domestic\" specifically means the USA because of some benefits of these funds?\n3. What will be the difference for me between investing in ETFs with USD fund currency and EUR fund currency?\n4. Does German tax exemption of 801 EUR reduce taxes from assets buy-sell difference (accumulating funds)? - Or it works only for taxes from dividends?\n5. Could you give an example of some popular bond funds available for investing in Germany?\n\nI understand that most of the questions are really country specific, sorry for that! Originally I'm not from Germany and still learning the language, so I can't really study the topic in local resources.",
