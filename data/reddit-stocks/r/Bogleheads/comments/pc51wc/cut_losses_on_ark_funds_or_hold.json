Of course, this is when it was at all time highs and then it promptly dropped and hasn’t recovered yet.  He says he’s a believer in Cathie and believes in the “5 year” timeline.  I would think that based on what he told me, he’s basically bagholding with about a 20k loss.\n\nI told him that it would probably be better to just cut his losses and put whatever he has into VTI.  He said that he has thought about it, but doesn’t want to, just in case it does go up again.  I told him that he probably shouldn’t have gone in on Ark in the first place, but this dude loves speculating - meme stocks, Bitcoin, etc.\n\nSo what does everyone think?  Would he be better off cutting his losses and putting everything into VTI?  Or should he wait until he breaks even?",
