      "selftext": "**Arithmetic vs Geometric Means**\n\nThere is more than 1 way to calculate the mean. For the purpose of this post we will focus on 2 ways, arithmetic &amp; geometric means. (Note - there are others, but not relevant to our return conversation).\n\nArithmetic means “math dealing with addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication”.\n\nHowever, THE arithmetic mean is what you likely of when you think of an average. The arithmetic mean is when you sum up all the numbers in a set and divide by the count of numbers in a set.\n\n\\--------\n\nA geometric sequence is a series of numbers that each number gets multiplied by the previous numbers. (Hmm…numbers multiplied in a series…sounds almost like how stock returns are calculated period to period huh?)\n\nThe geometric average is when you take the product of a set of ‘n’ numbers and then take the 1/nth root.\n\n**Simple Example:**\n\nTo make a simple example, lets say that you look at your last 4 years of investing. In no particular order, you see returns of 10%, 15%, 20%, and -7%.\n\nNot bad, 3 good years and 1 bad year.\n\nWhat is your average return?\n\nIf you take the arithmetic average you sum up 10% + 15% + 20% + (-7%) and divide by 4:\n\n[arithmetic avg](https://imgur.com/a/VFz59o8)\n\nIf you take the geometric average you multiple (1 + return) for each year and then take it to the 1/4th power minus 1:\n\n[geometric avg](https://imgur.com/a/NvJ0zGY)\n\nNow this is where is gets to the important point. What is the actual return you would have over the last 4 years? IE - What is the correct answer?\n\nIf you invested $100 four years ago and got a 10%, 15%, 20%, and -7% return over the 4 years, you would have:\n\n[return table](https://imgur.com/a/ZjwG21m)\n\nAnd the correct answer is the geometric average. The geometric average will give you the average return to use to get to the same ending value.\n\nYou can check by taking the ending value of the actuals and seeing the annualized return and confirming it matches. (141.17 / 100 )\\^(1/4) - 1 = 9%\n\n*\\[Note - you can see how all the returns &amp; portfolio growth formulas use the same multiplication as the geometric mean.\\]*\n\n**Bad Math &amp; Over Estimating Growth**\n\nIf someone were to take the ‘average’ of the last 4 years of returns and tell you them, and then if you used the ‘average’ return to project out your future expected portfolio growth, you would get very different numbers depending on which average you used.\n\nEven in our simple example with only a 50bps difference in return results in a huge different ending value:\n\n[variation in returns (excel graph)](https://imgur.com/a/sEkeKf4)\n\nThe easiest average to calculate is the arithmetic average. It is the one most people know. It is the one most people think of with average. And it is the one that gets used in these type of statements.\n\nIf you use a higher arithmetic average, it is easier to imply some low dollar amount will grow to over $1 million dollars over a long-enough time frame.\n\n&gt;**Remember, the arithmetic average will ALWAYS be larger than geometric average when looking at historical returns.**\n\nThe graph above may look relatively close, but the ending values are \\~$950,000 vs \\~$1,130,000. You are getting almost 20% lower ending values from that 0.5% difference, nearly $200k.\n\n**Wrap-up: Arithmetic vs Geometric Mean**\n\nUsing the arithmetic average when referencing prior returns should be a jailable offense, particularly if done in a way that over estimates the future portfolio growth.  Even using a 4-year history, you can see how quickly arithmetic and geometric averages can start to differ. \n\n\\--------\n\nSo, what's the point of this post?\n\n**Contributions Make The Actual Realized Average Return NOT The Geometric Average**\n\nGoing back to the simple example above, assume over 4 years you get returns of +10%, +15%, +20%, and -7%. If you invested $100 today, it would grow to $141 after the 4 years.\n\nWe showed that the arithmetic average of the 4 numbers is 9.5% but the actual return you received was the geometric average of 9.0%. Geometric averages are always lower for returns, 50 bps in this 4 year example.\n\n*Now it is time to take it a step further*\n\nIf you were to contribute $100 at the beginning of every year, what would your ending value be?\n\nPlug the numbers in and $100 invested at the beginning of the year, grown at 9% for 4 years =$498. \n\nBut also wrong. The actual answer is $454 to $551.\n\nWhy the range?\n\nBecause when you contribute money over time, the ***sequence of your returns matters.*** You can’t just look at the average return. Below in the 2 tables it shows the 2 paths to get to $454 or $551. (The ending portfolio value is highlighted in blue).\n\nIf the asset price goes down 7% then goes up 10%, 15%, &amp; 20% you get a higher ending value than if the asset price does the reverse (up 20%, 15%, 10%, then down 7%).\n\n[table](https://imgur.com/a/gbvC0F2)\n\nHowever if you look at the peach cells, you see that in both cases the ending price of the asset is the same $14.12. This aligns with the 9% average return over 4 years. *\\[$10 \\* (1.09\\^4) = $14.16 which is off by a few pennies for rounding when calculating\\]*\n\nIf it isn’t clear from above, when the price goes down first, you are able to accumulate more shares with each contribution. Your initial purchase the price is $10 under both scenarios. When you make your 2nd contribution:\n\n* In the “down-then-up” scenario, the price of the asset has dropped to $9.30 and your $100 buys 10.75 shares, vs\n* In the “up-then-down” scenario, the price jumped up 20% to $12, which means you only are able to buy 8.33 shares with $10.\n* You were able to buy almost 30% more shares if the market goes down first.\n\nA similar story happens for your 3rd and 4th purchases. In the decrease then increase scenario, the prices are lower and you are able to buy more shares with each contribution.\n\nYou end up with 39.03 shares vs 32.17 shares for the same $400 of contributions. Over 20% more shares are owned going into the last period.\n\nThen in the last year, you get a 20% growth on your larger share count in the “decrease-then-increase” scenario really driving a big pop. Whereas in the other scenario, right when your portfolio is the largest, it drops 7% leading to a big $ loss.\n\n**Result - Sequence of Returns Matters When Making Contributions**\n\nBoth of these scenario have an ‘average’ return that is the same. A 9.5% arithmetic mean and a 9.0% geometric mean.\n\nBut you wind up with 20% less value in this simple 4 year example just from the different order of your returns. This is when your average is not your average.\n\nSince each contribution is in for a different period of time and each contribution grows the portfolio, you have more $ contributed at the end than the beginning. To get the real average return, you need to weight each return by the money in the portfolio.\n\nThe solution?\n\n**The Money Weighted Rate of Return:**\n\nThis is simply an internal rate-of-return (IRR) calculation where each contribution you make &amp; the ending portfolio value gets discounted back to time 0. You are solving for what rate makes it so all your discounted contributions = your discounted ending portfolio value. \n\n[formula](https://imgur.com/a/9xbBzPj)\n\nHow does the MWRR work for our two 4-year scenarios above?\n\n[solution](https://imgur.com/a/UvzlbAT)\n\nAll right, now we have one potential answer for the actual realized ‘average’ return. You can check the results to confirm it is accurate with our Future Value function and see that it matches: \n\n[FPV](https://imgur.com/a/kXdYUjY)\n\nWe match. 13.2% is the actual realized return on all of our contributions in the decrease then increase scenario. We had the most money into the portfolio and then the last year saw a big 20% return. Since we had $400 of contribution in there that had grown 3 years already, the 20% return got the most ‘weight’ by portfolio size.\n\nWhile in the increase then decrease scenario our actual realized return is 5.1%. We only had a $100 contribution in when the bit 20% return hit, but had our biggest portfolio ‘weight’ to the -7% down year, which dragged down performance.\n\n\\------\n\nTo bring this first circle, I decided to a theory from the start. $555 a month contributed at an average return of 9.5% for 30 years is over $1 million.\n\nI started with the SP500 Total Return (TR) index going as far back as I could get it (Feb 1988).\n\n* Total Return index INCLUDES dividends, so it is typically 1-3% better returns than the regular SP500 index. Regular SP500 index is a price index and ignores dividends. By choosing the TR index, we are giving the chance for the MOST growth. (ie-best chance our test shows $1,000,000).\n* I took the 30 years of monthly returns for each 360-month period possible up to the present (6/15/2022).\n   * March 1, 1988 to Feb 28, 2018 is the first 30 year period\n   * April 1, 1988 to March 31, 2018 is the second 30 year period\n   * July 1, 1992 to June 15, 2022 is the last 30 year period (month not over, but included the month-to-date return)\n* There is a total of 53 returns\n   * Note- I would love to have a longer history and more data, but this does a sufficient job of showing the potential difference in outcome even with only 53 possible periods\n* The lowest Geometric average return across those 52 periods is 9.3%. Very close to the 9.5% return in the tweet listed at the start.\n   * $555 monthly contributions at an average of 9.3% for 30 yrs is $1,090,300\n   * Note - The lowest arithmetic average of 30 years is over 10%\n\n**To Summarize:**\n\n“The lowest average return over a 30 year period since 1988 is 10.3%. If you contribute $555 a month at an average return of 10.3%, you would have $1.35 million in 30 years.”\n\n* Technically, the arithmetic average is 10.3%, so that is an ‘average’. And if you got a constant 10.3%, you would have $1.35 million in 30 years. Both statements are ***not*** false, although both are misleading.\n\nEnough build up…what does the actual historical numbers say? In our scenario with a 9.3% average (geometric) return, did we hit $1,000,000?\n\nNope, only $838,736.\n\nYou fell nearly 20% short of expectations\n\n[graph](https://imgur.com/a/oNTx4G2)\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you can see that the worst scenario (blue) is very close to the best scenario (orange) till about year 27. Then there is a big divergence at the end.\n\n**Conclusions: Money-Weighted Rate Of Return Is The Average You’ve Been Looking For**\n\nThe arithmetic average returns are 10.4% vs 12.1%… But these are obviously incorrect.\n\nThe geometric average returns are 9.3% vs 10.9%. But that is misleading because you can’t use the geometric returns when you making contributions over time.\n\nThe money-weighted returns are 8.5% vs 10.9% (coincidently). This is the real ‘average’ return your money made over the 30 year period.\n\nThis is why my flippant response to the question of “what is the best advice for a lower income to have a successful retirement?”…Be born in the right year.\n\nThe best scenario above is from 1/1/1992-12/31/2021. The worst scenario is 4/1/1990-3/31/2020. You have 2 people who do the exact same behavior (invest $555 a month for 30 years). One ends up with over $1,300,000 and gets almost an 11% money-weighted return. The other ends up with less than $900,000 and gets a 8.5% MWRR.\n\nA 50% difference in results based on being born 2 years later.",

You can check the results to confirm it is accurate with our Future Value function and see that it matches: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/kXdYUjY\"&gt;FPV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We match. 13.2% is the actual realized return on all of our contributions in the decrease then increase scenario. We had the most money into the portfolio and then the last year saw a big 20% return. Since we had $400 of contribution in there that had grown 3 years already, the 20% return got the most ‘weight’ by portfolio size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in the increase then decrease scenario our actual realized return is 5.1%. We only had a $100 contribution in when the bit 20% return hit, but had our biggest portfolio ‘weight’ to the -7% down year, which dragged down performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To bring this first circle, I decided to a theory from the start. $555 a month contributed at an average return of 9.5% for 30 years is over $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started with the SP500 Total Return (TR) index going as far back as I could get it (Feb 1988).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Total Return index INCLUDES dividends, so it is typically 1-3% better returns than the regular SP500 index. Regular SP500 index is a price index and ignores dividends. By choosing the TR index, we are giving the chance for the MOST growth. (ie-best chance our test shows $1,000,000).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I took the 30 years of monthly returns for each 360-month period possible up to the present (6/15/2022).\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;March 1, 1988 to Feb 28, 2018 is the first 30 year period&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;April 1, 1988 to March 31, 2018 is the second 30 year period&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;July 1, 1992 to June 15, 2022 is the last 30 year period (month not over, but included the month-to-date return)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is a total of 53 returns\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Note- I would love to have a longer history and more data, but this does a sufficient job of showing the potential difference in outcome even with only 53 possible periods&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The lowest Geometric average return across those 52 periods is 9.3%. Very close to the 9.5% return in the tweet listed at the start.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$555 monthly contributions at an average of 9.3% for 30 yrs is $1,090,300&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Note - The lowest arithmetic average of 30 years is over 10%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Summarize:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The lowest average return over a 30 year period since 1988 is 10.3%. If you contribute $555 a month at an average return of 10.3%, you would have $1.35 million in 30 years.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technically, the arithmetic average is 10.3%, so that is an ‘average’. And if you got a constant 10.3%, you would have $1.35 million in 30 years. Both statements are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; false, although both are misleading.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enough build up…what does the actual historical numbers say? In our scenario with a 9.3% average (geometric) return, did we hit $1,000,000?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope, only $838,736.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You fell nearly 20% short of expectations&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/oNTx4G2\"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at the above chart, you can see that the worst scenario (blue) is very close to the best scenario (orange) till about year 27. Then there is a big divergence at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions: Money-Weighted Rate Of Return Is The Average You’ve Been Looking For&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The arithmetic average returns are 10.4% vs 12.1%… But these are obviously incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The geometric average returns are 9.3% vs 10.9%. But that is misleading because you can’t use the geometric returns when you making contributions over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The money-weighted returns are 8.5% vs 10.9% (coincidently). This is the real ‘average’ return your money made over the 30 year period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why my flippant response to the question of “what is the best advice for a lower income to have a successful retirement?”…Be born in the right year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best scenario above is from 1/1/1992-12/31/2021. The worst scenario is 4/1/1990-3/31/2020. You have 2 people who do the exact same behavior (invest $555 a month for 30 years). One ends up with over $1,300,000 and gets almost an 11% money-weighted return. The other ends up with less than $900,000 and gets a 8.5% MWRR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A 50% difference in results based on being born 2 years later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
