If you find it stressful, try to avoid watching the news and continue investing as usual. Better yet: if you're young, cultivate a 'stocks are on sale' attitude and be glad you can keep buying at lower prices. Whatever you do, avoid short-term, split-second decision-making.\n\nHopefully, you've planned for bumps in the road. You have an emergency fund in cash (like a savings or checking account) as a baseline. Beyond that, you know your risk tolerance and have a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, including home country and international equities. If you feel stress-tested by all of this, consider waiting it out without taking any action at all (or changing contributions). Then as things normalize, decide if maybe you should shift your stock/bond balance. Or if there is no recovery: sharpen some spears and start learning how to fish!\n\nBecause at the end of the day, things will recover. If they don't, your investments won't matter anyway. The biggest mistake you could make right now is capitulating and trying to time exits and entries. There are some chilling threads over on Bogleheads.org from the 08/09 crisis (a much bigger downturn!) filled with fear and (later) regret from panic selling. Every dip is different in its details, but if the past is any indicator, things will recover sooner or later.\n\nI have no idea if things will go up or down from here. I'm just rebalancing my allocation per my plan made years ago, and have only tweaked slightly along the way (and always in small ways and at non-volatile times). If you don't have a plan written down, it's worth doing - it can help you keep emotions in trek and invested in various scenarios.\n\nBut in the words of The Dude: that's just, like, my opinion, man!\n\nMeanwhile, stay safe out there, folks, and stay the course.",
