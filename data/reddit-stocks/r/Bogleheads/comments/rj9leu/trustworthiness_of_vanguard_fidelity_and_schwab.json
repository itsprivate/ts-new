Or do they usually just continue to suggest what its obvious you've been doing? Also does anyone have an experience with Vanguard doing the same thing trying to direct people to hire cost funds or services.(if there are any really) As I said the cost basis is minimal but I would like to pay the last fees however it is part of the ownership structure makes my wife not get a hard sell after I'm dead it seems worth it to keep my stuff with Vanguard. Any personal experiences would be appreciated. Maybe they are all the same and I'm overthinking it.",
