  "selftext": "Hi all, thank you for taking the time to read.\n\nI am 36 years old, and 2 years ago went from making 95K (resident/fellow) to 340K per year. People with 10 years of experience in my field are making about 450K. My partner makes 110K and the most senior people in their field make 175K. Over the past 2 years we built an emergency fund (80K) and then bought an expensive house. We live in a very high COL area of Seattle. We have a 1.5M mortgage at 2.55% interest, 30 year fixed. We really don't spend much money outside of the mortgage, and a few months ago we had accumulated a massive pile of cash, which I learned was a silly place to leave it. So, I started reading on here and came up with a plan. We  want to focus on building wealth as efficiently as possible for our retirement and our child(ren).\n\nI am now maxing $20,500 per year into my 401K and my employer gives 9% (yes 9%) of my salary to the same 401K, which gets to about 51K per year to the 401K. I am then putting about 9-10K of post-tax into a 403(b) (I think it is an IRA?) to get to the max total retirement contribution of 61K. My partner now also puts the $20,500 to  401K. All are in a Fidelity target date funds. \n\nWe then created a small 529 for our 2 year old child, and we plan to have more kids. This is invested 80% in FSKAX and 20% in FTIHX, and in a handful of years planning to move it to a graduation-date TDF.\n\nWe then created a post-tax brokerage fund last week. We started with 20K, 80% FSKAX and 20% FTIHX. \n\nWe then just purchased 20K of Series I-bonds, and will keep that route until interest rates fall.\n\nSo, overall, we have all of our retirement funds in Fidelity TDF. Are there any other tax-advantaged options we should be looking in to? My HR doesn't know if we are allowed to do a backdoor Roth IRA to add more to those. Is that TDF a good plan for us? Then, we have brokerage funds and a 529 in 80/20 FSKAX/FTIHX. I chose those because everything was already in Fidelity. Is that a reasonable combo for our goals? I was planning to check in on it once per year to rebalance to 80/20. I didn't do bonds because I learned that those should stay in retirement rather than brokerage for tax purposes.\n\nSince we have 80K of emergency fund, ideally I would want all of our excess money each pay period to go in to either the brokerage fund or the 529. Is that too aggressive? And which should we focus on building? Anywhere else we should be putting the money? Anything you would change about our plan?\n\nThank you for reading my novel.",
