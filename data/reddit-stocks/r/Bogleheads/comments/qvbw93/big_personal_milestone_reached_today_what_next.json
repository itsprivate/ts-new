Mom is overcoming cancer and will likely be out of work till 2022, had surgery to remove cancer and will be going through radiation sessions soon (hopefully no chemo). Fortunately (or unfortunately) she makes so little money that she's always qualified for medicaid and all her treatments have been covered. \n\nI haven't crunched the numbers but I think all the bills (personal, communal, her personal) will likely run between 4-5k till February 2022... fingers crossed she can get back to work sooner. Brother makes about 30-35k but does not routinely contribute to communal bills, mom doesn't force him and that's just the way it is, it's fruitless to argue about it. \n\nAny advice on what my next move should be?  I feel like I stalk this sub enough to know the basics: open a Roth and split funds between an US index, international index, and bond right? I guess I need that echo chamber to confirm. I'm very much a serial saver. \n\nI want to make this money work in my favor. Growing up in poverty I've gained a serious emergency mindset. I'm obsessed with preparing for the worst because bad news is the only consant. That's how my family existed; constantly stressed about money, the next bill, and next big financial disaster etc.\n\nSorry for the long post, ANY advice is GREATLY appreciated!",
