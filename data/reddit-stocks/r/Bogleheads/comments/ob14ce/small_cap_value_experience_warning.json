I wanted to share my experience with it for those considering taking the plunge.\n\nDuring the 2008 and More recently the Covid corrections, I had absolutely no fear that the markets would eventually recover. I just kept putting money into the market with every paycheck according to my investment plan. In both cases my diligence paid off and I was able to experience significant return. I didn’t lose any sleep and thought my risk tolerance was very high.\n\nGiven the recent discussions about small cap value, I was excited to add it to my portfolio. I thought I wouldn’t mind the increased risk as I felt I still had many years from retirement. At first it was great. it was making good returns and seemed to offer some diversification from VT. It would go down some days when VT was up and up some days VT was down. However, I then experienced a sell off week where it fell almost 9% in a single week for no reason. It caused me anxiety for no reason. I was researching the persistence of the small cap and value factors and doubting myself given the past decade of underperformance. I was also constantly trying to figure out the optimal ratio for my portfolio.\n\nI decided to wait until it returned to a more reasonable level and then sold my position yesterday. I returned to my portfolio of 100% VT and slept like a baby last night.\n\nFortunately my experience did not cost me anything as the trades were made in my Roth IRA and I was able to get out at a similar gain as VT made during the period. Just thought I’d share my experience with it for those interested in the value premium. It does make a lot of sense but is not worth the additional risk and sleepless nights for me.",
