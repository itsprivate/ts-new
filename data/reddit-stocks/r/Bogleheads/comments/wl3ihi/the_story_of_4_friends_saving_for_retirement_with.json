It's the story of 4 friends who are 65 and about to retire. And for the past 45 years they were each able to save £50 a month.\n\n3 of them invested into the S&amp;P 500🇺🇸, while the 4th friend just saved their money in the bank. So they were all:\n\n👴 the same age\n💵saved the same amount\n⌚over the same 45 years\n📈into the same investment\n\nBut they each now have a very different account balance, and that's because the only difference was in their approach to saving and investing, how they actually did it.\n\nNow of course they couldn’t predict the future, but they knew 45 years in the stock market wouldn't all be plain sailing. And sure enough, it wasn't. There were actually 5 main market crashes during their 45 year investment (Black Tuesday in 1987, the Kuwait War in 1990, the dot-com crash starting in 2000, the global financial crisis in 2008, and most recently, the market crash caused by COVID in 2020).\n\n🤦‍♀️ Sally\nSally hated investing, she thought it was scary, risk and only for the rich. So she saved her £50/month into a savings account paying her 3%/year. \n\nAfter 45 years, she's ready to retire and has a pot of £57,019 to show for her efforts.\n\n🙍‍♀️ Alice\nHer friend Alice, put her £50/month into the same 3% savings account, until she picked her moment to invest, as she wanted to avoid any market crashes. So when she thought it was a good time to invest, she took all the money she had saved up in her savings account and invested it. And then continued saving her £50 into her savings account until again she thought the time was right. \n\nHowever, she wasn’t very good at timing the market. She was actually terrible, as bad as you could be. She invested 5 times during the 45 year period, each time investing right before the 5 main crashes.\n\nBut even despite having the worlds worst timing, she still ended up with £309,297. \n\n💁‍♂️ Pete\nPete took the exact same approach as Alice, but only had the world's best timing. He invested at the market bottom, right after each market crash.\n\nOf course being the perfect investor it served Pete very well, he ended up with 44% more than Alice, with £444,865. \n\n🧘 Charlie\nThe last friend, Charlie, took a different approach to all his friends. He didn't care about timing, reading the news, keeping up to date with the stock market, and prices. \n\nHe set-up a regular monthly savings plan into his account of £50, and never looked at it again. That means that every month £50 would come out his account automatically, and be invested at whatever the price was on that day.\n\nAnd he ended up with........ £735,720! \n\n🥡 Key Takeaways\n\n1️⃣ Literally doing nothing, the most simple strategy of the 3, made way more than timing the market to perfection (65% to be precise), which is impossible to do consistently anyway.\n2️⃣Channel your inner consistent Charlie\n3️⃣Ask yourself, does investing have to be complex?",
