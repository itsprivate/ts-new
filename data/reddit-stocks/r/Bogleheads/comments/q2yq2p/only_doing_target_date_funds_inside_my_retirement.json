As a result, I've stuck all of my retirement savings into target date funds, because I didn't think I was capable of re-balancing or making smart decisions with fund selection.\n\n**Current Retirement Accounts:**\n\n--Roth IRA: Vanguard 2060 (VTTSX) w/ $40k balance. Maxed out annually.\n\n--Roth 457(b): Blackrock 2060 (LIZKX) w/ $18k balance. Currently contributing $5k/yr.\n\n--I'm also vested in a pension system.\n\nI'm in my late 20s now and have been thinking about upping my investments substantially, as I haven't been spending much during the pandemic and all my savings are sitting around as cash. So I'm thinking about upping my 457(b) investment and opening a traditional one instead of continuing to add to the existing Roth.\n\nWould it be a good idea to stay with LIZKX? My employer offers some other options such as VINIX, VIGIX, VTMNX, and VMVAX. Maybe I should try something new, as opening a traditional 457(b) with LIZKX again would make it my third retirement account with a target date 2060 fund...\n\nI've been considering opening a taxable account as well, just in case I need money in middle age/want to retire early. Of course, my preference would be yet another target date fund to make my life easier, but then that would be a fourth one.\n\nI'm not opposed to the work of re-balancing a portfolio; I just don't think I currently have the knowledge to do it intelligently. Any input would be appreciated, thanks!",
