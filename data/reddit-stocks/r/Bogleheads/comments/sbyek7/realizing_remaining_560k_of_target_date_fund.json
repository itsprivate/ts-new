I posted/vented here and then got contacted by the Wall Street Journal, and then interviewed on the phone. Wow. I have learned a tremendous amount in 1 week and it started with a post on Reddit Bogleheads! So thanks for that and the helpful comments here. üëç\n\nBecause of Vanguard's mishandling of the institutional TDF's, I was forced to realize $550k of capital gains which I'll pay \\~$160k of taxes on for my 2021 tax return. I see this as a loss of investment capital...but not much I can do. \\[Trigger warning ahead...please be gentle üòä\\] Well, I have \\*another\\* \\~$560k of unrealized gains in my 2035 target date fund holdings. After thinking and thinking and working out the numbers on paper, I'm thinking I'm going to go ahead and realize the remaining gain in 2022, pay the taxes, and dollar cost average out an exchange from VTTHX (2035 TDF) to VTSAX or VTI over 3 months. Ironically, if the stock market tanks, this would really benefit me to limit my capital gains I'm just going to DCA and not try to time the market for this exchange. \n\nI still actually like and believe in TDF's in taxable accounts and it worked well for for where my head was at the time. I was not ready to go full VTSAX, deal with ETF's, or manage a mix of funds/ETS's. I got what I needed in a single fund. I actually enjoy seeing income spin off the funds--with normal capital gains. But the 2035 TDF eventually becomes an income fund which has been a concern for about 6 months now and the Vanguard issue I guess is a signal to move on. While I have enjoyed a nice run with TDF 2035, and some solid gains, I think I'd be better off just realizing the remaining gains, exiting the fund in favor of VTSAX/VTI which will have a roughly 3 point better return than the 2035 TDF over time as the TDF continues to shift towards bonds.\n\nSo, I'd really appreciate any comments/experience shares you could provide on this plan. üòÄ",
