(I know you’re not “supposed” to invest money you need in a couple years, but if I lose money by the time I want to use it, I’ll just keep it in the account and use money from other savings such as HYSA or I-bonds.\n\nSo far I have $3,000 in it and have VBIAX which I just realized was not tax-efficient for a taxable account.  I’ll probably contribute $100-$200 a month.\n\nKeeping in mind I hope to use this money in two - three years:\n\n1.) My Roth is 100% VTSAX. Is there a downside to also having my taxable account 100% VTSAX?\n\n2.) Should I switch VBIAX to VTIAX or  VTWAX?\n\n3.) Is there another tax-efficient funds I should be looking at?\n\nFinally, this is a dumb question: how do I go about switching funds? Do I sell to my settlement fund and then buy the new fund using that money?\n\nThanks everyone!",
