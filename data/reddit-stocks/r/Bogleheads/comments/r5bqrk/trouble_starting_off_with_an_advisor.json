In the past I have been a complete idiot with financial matters. Recently my dad passed away and left us a considerable sum. My wife is pretty adamant she wants an advisor and looking at my past financial mistakes I agree with her. \n\nSo I went out and researched like crazy. We met with a friend's trusted 1% Aum guy, a Vanguard PAS guy and an advice-only guy. I liked the AUM guy and his advice but I think Bogleheads has turned me sour on AUM. Plus the AUM guy wanted everything at his brokerage.\n\nWe initially liked the advice-only guy because he was cheaper and I thought he help me get my feet underneath me for DIY down the road. We could set everything up wherever we want. I also liked him because he set us up on their version of Mint to track all our spending. \n\nBut he constantly hmmed and hawed on allocation. We had our 2nd meeting today and for an hour and a half he talked about getting a new credit card and retirement goals and tasks and ... I finally jumped in and said if you had to invest my dad's money what funds in the market tomorrow and what allocation would he recommend? He pulls up his website and hits an 70/30 Risk button - hits another button and boom pops out an 11 fund portfolio. I ask him what's the software they're using and he talks about low cost ratios. I asked him if they're licensing a robo-advisor of some kind and he kind of yada yada'd that one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0tddsua71n281.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b10ab2c9e458779ecc41a882376843dc097f360a\n\nI got kind of mad that it took him this long to throw out how he delivers allocation advice. I've been looking at 3 and 4 fund Vanguard and Fidelity portfolios and told him that's what I wanted. Then my wife got mad. \"I'm so tired of hearing about Boogle Heads,\" she says. She's like \"what's wrong with this?\" - and I just shut up. I really don't know what I'm doing I'm just a guy that reads a forum who's messed up pretty bad in the past. Bogleheads is tough when you don't have a clue what you're doing but yet know you want something super simple but can't explain why that's better. I can't explain why VTI/VXUS/BND is better than this. Maybe it's not all that better? Maybe this is a perfectly fine portfolio?\n\nHe also said he wants to DCA this and not lump sum. So my question is - say I go along with this in a Fidelity account. How hard would it be to convert this into a VTI/VXUS/BND down the road?",
