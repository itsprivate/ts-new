My plan is to pay off my student loans, fund my 2021 and 2022 rIRA, drop a few grand in my sons 529, and gift a grand to each of my brother’s kid’s 529s. After all of this I’ll still have roughly $30k for invest in a taxable brokerage.\n\nI’ve had about a year and a half to come to terms with it, but I still feel guilty using the money for myself. My grandpa had a very difficult childhood and life. He worked multiple jobs at a time his whole life (sometimes as many as 4) and was the scrappiest, toughest man I’ve ever known. For him to have anything left when he past at the age of 85 is unbelievable really. I guess I feel guilty because he sacrificed so much to make this money and I didn’t do anything to earn it.\n\nHas anybody ever been in a similar situation? What did you do to combat the guilt and reconcile these feelings?",
