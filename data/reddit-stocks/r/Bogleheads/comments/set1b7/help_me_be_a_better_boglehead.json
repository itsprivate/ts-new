And because of that, I assume I do not get any tax advantage in a Traditional IRA?  But I maxed out Roth IRA every year I was eligible for it.\n- just bought $10k Series I bonds thanks to Bogleheads lol\n- non-tax advantaged, monthly automated DCA into Vanguard 2060 target date fund.\n\n**It...it can't be this easy, can it?** I feel like I'm doing something wrong.\n\nWhich brings me to requesting advice on how to be a better Boglehead.\n\nShould I take my current investments in the non-tax advantaged target date fund and move them into VTWAX/BNDW or a three-fund portfolio?  I have been told there are large tax implications for the target date funds.\n\nWhat's my best play here, or it really doesn't matter and I can happily automate my investments (literally do not know how the markets are doing right now) and keep DCAing into the target date fund?\n\nAppreciate any and all advice.
