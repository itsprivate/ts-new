  "selftext": "I've never really considered an Health Savings Account because I was scared by the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) requirement. After doing the math, I've realize how wrong I was! In short, if you can save a couple hundred dollars per month, an HSA is possibly your best investment vehicle (after an employer-matched 401K). Here are the calculations to consider...\n\n#1 - Determine your tax savings. Find your tax bracket at https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets HSA contributions are pre-tax, so reduce your taxable income. I'm in the 22% bracket, so my tax saving is 22% on contributions. My state tax saving is an additional 5% (yours will vary based on state). Let's say I can contribute $300/month or $3600 year. My 27% tax savings would be $972/year.\n\n#2 - Determine your insurance premium savings. You'll need to consult your employer or health insurance provider. I work for a state education institution. My current family \"wellness\" plan is $174/month and the HDHP plan is $46/month - so a savings of $128/month or $1536/year.\n\n#3 - Consider how much MORE you might pay in health care expenses with the HDHP. This is the part that always scared me away, but it turns out it's nearly impossible to pay more than I would save.\n\nIf I have $0 in health care costs, switching to a HDHP and putting $300/month in an HSA would save me $2508/year ($972 tax savings + $1536 premiums savings).\n\nMy current plan has a $1500/family deductible (then 30%), whereas the HDHP has a $3000/family deductible (then 20%). If I had $3000 in expenses (doctor visits and one minor surgery or a couple ER visits per year, etc. - fairly typical for me), the savings would be around $1508/year ($2508 savings - ~$1000 difference in expenses).\n\nLet's say things go REALLY bad - like a serious accident, cancer, etc. My current plan max is $8000 and the HDHP max is $10000. In this worst-case scenario I still save $508 ($2508-$2000 max difference).\n\nThe only way I could lose money on an HSA is to contribute <$140/month AND hit my $10K max out-of-pocket every year.\n\nSo, $140+/month in an HSA is already a no-lose scenario for me, but that doesn't consider the additional value of the tax-free HSA gains over time. This is best realized by never using HSA funds to pay medical expenses (unless you have to or until you want to). $300/month at a 7% annual return for 20 years returns $156,278 on $72,000 in contributions. Maxing out at $600/month returns $312,556 on $86,400 in contributions. THESE GAINS ARE 100% TAX FREE! You never pay taxes on HSA contributions, gains, or withdrawals (thus the triple-tax advantage)!\n\nNow, the HSA funds must be spent on health care expenses (or pay a 20% penalty). A couple can expect $300K+ in retirement health expenses. However, you can reimburse yourself for expenses incurred any time while on the plan - save your receipts for 20 years and then pay yourself. After age 65, you can apply them to long-term care expenses. Or you can use them on whatever you want by simply paying taxes on the withdrawals - making the HSA no different than a Traditional IRA.\n\nIs there anything I'm overlooking? Is the HSA really a no-brainer?",
