They were:\n\n1. Who is the plan administrator? - One of her bosses\n2. Did ADP go through these new funds with you? - No they did not go into detail about the funds. they partnered with Morgan Stanley who sent a FA to the presentation who will be managing the 401k.\n\nEveryone in the room receiving the presentation did not know much, if anything about investments so I tried not to totally hijack the meeting and make it sound like investing was bad. I quietly sat through the presentation which occurred in a surgery room (because it had the most space) in the small veterinary clinic. Most were in scrubs, I was in a nicer suit than the Morgan Stanley FA because I was working and left work to attend this meeting. I’m a Middle Market Commercial Banker. The presentation consisted of “it’s important to invest early.. blah blah blah” and did not mention fees. At the end, he asked if anyone had questions. I paused for two seconds to give any employees a chance to ask something and then shot my hand up. Some of my questions and the response:\n\n1. Are their cheaper fund options? -they will check but probably not.\n2. I went on a triad about the crazy fees. I said front loads are scams and he said they are waived for this plan. I confirmed that with him twice because I wanted to make sure he knew he was specifically telling me they are waived. If I get charged a front load fee, I will seek legal advice.\n3. Why is option 13 so expensive when it says it’s an sp500 index fund? -no good answer. He went into why the actively managed funds in the plan are beneficial.\n4. I said “you know most active managers fail to beat their benchmarks over multiple years?” - he said yes around 60%ish which strictly contradicts his statements to the group on their benefits.\n\nI asked some more but I forget. I asked who these fees are going to and he said the fund companies and 50% of the expense ratio is going to his firm. He mentioned there is no fee for employees to have Morgan Stanley manage their allocations, etc. all that is baked in the expense ratios.\n\nQuestion for Reddit, can they force you to have your 401k managed? I mean, I don’t need his services and don’t want to pay the funds that pay him. I have his email and some other contacts about the plan. I’m following up with a bunch more questions but I need to have a serious conversation with my wife’s bosses which they are open to.",
