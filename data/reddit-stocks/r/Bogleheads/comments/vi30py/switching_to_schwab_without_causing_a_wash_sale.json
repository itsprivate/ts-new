I also want to swap my Roth IRA funds from vtsax to voo, so I will also discuss that plan as well\n\nCurrent accounts:\nVanguard taxable with vtsax and vtiax \nVanguard Roth IRA with vtsax\nWife’s Roth IRA VOO\n\nBackground:\nI last purchased VOO today, VTIAX yesterday, VTSAX on 31 May. Dividends are set to not re-invest.\n\nGoing forward:\n\n1. My cost basis at vanguard is already set to SpecID and I have the cost basis reports and tax documents downloaded just in case I lose access.\n\n2. Swap the vtsax in my Roth IRA to vfiax.\n\n3. Exchange my vtsax, vtiax, and vfiax for vti, vxus, and voo tax free while they are still at vanguard.\n\n4. Wait 2 trading days for everything to clear.\n\n5. Move everything to Schwab.\n\n6. Continue my monthly contributions!\n\nAm I missing anything? It is my assumption that I can swap the mutual funds for their etf counterparts while at vanguard tax-free.\n\nWhile all the other funds are playing shuffle, I am just going to buy my etfs at Schwab. There should be no issues with investing with Schwab before bringing my accounts over, correct?\n\nI just want to be sure I am not going to cause a wash sale.\n\nThanks!",
