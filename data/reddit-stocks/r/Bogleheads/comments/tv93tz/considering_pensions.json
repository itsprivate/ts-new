A recent article I read said that retired teachers in Texas had not received a cost of living adjustment since 2004. Someone receiving $2000 in 2004 should now be receiving $3000 to adjust for cost of living (but that’s not happening, they’re still getting 2000). My husband and I do max out Roth IRAs each year and plan to continue to do that. But since I’m not a teacher (I am a speech pathologist.), I could change jobs or keep working in schools as an independent contractor and avoid the pension system. Some positions would have access to a matched 401k but a lot would be unmatched. I’m struggling to weigh these options. I used to think having a pension added nice balance to my portfolio so that in my retirement years even if the market was doing terribly I’d still have some guaranteed income.  But the lack of COLA is making me rethink things. Never mind the fact that I’m not really enjoying my job right now…but I think that’s hopefully mostly temporary due to COVID related increases in paperwork. All other things being equal, how would you move forward knowing your eventual pension would not adjust for cost of living regularly? We also don’t pay into social security if you are in TRS so I wouldn’t be able to draw that and when my husband passes on would also be subject to a reduction in what I could receive from his social security. But if I get out now I could get back into a job that pays into SS and avoid all that.",
