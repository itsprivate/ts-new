  "selftext": "Hey everyone. I've always heard that indices which track the S&P500 offer a good mix of diversification but recently I've been told that's not the case and that a three-fund portfolio is the way to go. There's a lot of great info about that on here. So I decided to compare them and see how it looks.\n\n# Methodology\n\nI used backtesting with PortfolioVisualizer to compare a **100% SPY** approach (this is an ETF that tracks the S&P500 index), versus two three fund portfolios: a **Hi-bond portfolio** (40% total bond index, 30% total US stock, 30% total international stock), and a **Lo-Bond portfolio** (10% bond index, 45% US total stock, 45% total intl stock).\n\nThe assumptions here use the default parameters of PortfolioVisualizer: starting with 10K lumpsum, no other contributions, annual reballancing, and reinvesting dividends.  This covers the dotcom bubble as well as the 2008 crisis.\n\nThe assets in the three-fund portfolios are all Vanguard mutual funds. I chose these because they are generally older and allow covering further back in time. Specifically I was aiming for before the 2008 crisis. There are newer ETFs which cover similar indices with a more favorable lower expense ratio (ER), but these all go back to \\~2010. This is also why I chose SPY over VOO. Using lower ER options, which seem to generally be ETFs over mutual funds, will of course offer slight benefits over these exact options. The analysis runs from Jan 1997 to May 2021.\n\nThe high-bond portfolio is meant to replicate a two-fund portfolio breakdown of bonds/stocks at a 40:60 ratio, but because the recommended historical stock fund there has apparently been disctontinued and cannot be viewed on PortfolioVisualizer (VTWSX), I resorted to a three-fund stock with the same stock:bond ratio and equal split of domestic and intl stocks. I think this may slightly undervalue the stock allocation in that portfolio due to double stock fund ER hit. The low-bond portfolio is 10% bonds to 90% stocks, with equal weight of US to intl total stock allocation.\n\n# Results\n\nA more complete results slideshow is available on google slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vlA5Z8d1vqkBv4DvGd8p3RY3R9Am191UkSKwt3Aon8g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vlA5Z8d1vqkBv4DvGd8p3RY3R9Am191UkSKwt3Aon8g/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe portfolio comparison results are visualized below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Portfolio Visualizer Results](https://preview.redd.it/gm69e95uce871.png?width=2180&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbdf65b22c47254acba659b3bd942b226d208e38)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe details of the three-fund portfolios are below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Details of three-fund portfolios including tickers, allocations and expense ratios](https://preview.redd.it/g78vmbpvee871.png?width=2378&format=png&auto=webp&s=690be3898f6e283909cb430bb5eac8998d8f71ba)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* These results indicate that **S&P500 have given the most returns over the whole time period**. This is primarily because it took off starting in 2014.\n* The high-stock three-fund portfolio outperformed the high-bond portfolio over the whole time course. This may be because there is significant overlap with the S&P500.\n* The high-bond portfolio performed best during the 2008 crash, until \\~2013.\n* I am not showing the details, but using ETFs with lower ER (ie VOO over SPY; and Vanguard ETFs over Vanguard mutual funds in the three-fund portfolio) is always slightly better. (these were not used in the main comparison because they don;t track back far enough in time).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Discussion and Followup Questions\n\nThese results indicate that if I had invested 10K in Jan 1997, I would have made more returns from an S&P500 index fund than a 3-fund strategy, this is true if I would have sold at almost any point of the time period except 2008-2013. If I had waited until May 2021, SPY clearly gives better returns largely because of  relative outperformance since 2014. For the rest of the historical record, the portfolios are more comparable. The high-bond portfolio dominates starting in 2008 through 2013, which seems consistent with a common intuition about bonds being relative safe harbors during times of crisis.\n\nThis naturally raises a few questions in my mind:\n\n* Is the S&P500 \"overpriced\" at this point?\n* What happened in 2014 and since then to drive the S&P500 overperformance?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Additionally, how would a 4-fund portfolio that also includes real-estate (REIT) compare here? I did not have time to followup on this, but this is a strategy some take.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust some concluding notes:\n\nHistorical data is better than no data, but it cannot predict the future. I am currently long VOO which is a S&P500 ETF that is almost identical in performance to SPY. I am not a financial advisor. Would love to hear your thoughts.",
