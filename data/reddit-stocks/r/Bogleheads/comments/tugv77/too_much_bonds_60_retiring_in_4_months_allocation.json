They just turned 60 and since they started working early on are now eligible for the State's pension.\n\nThe pension amounts to €30k/year net of taxes, which is half what they used to make on an average year. They live in Northern Italy, own their house, have no debt and total annual expenses are roughly €30k-40k/year. \n\nWhen I started helping with their investments they had a way too conservative portfolio in my opinion: 75% Bond Mutual Funds and money market Mutual Funds+ 25% equity Mutual Funds. All of which entirely managed by the bank's financial advisor/private banker. \n\nIn 2018/19 I suggested to move a small amount from the Mutual Fund ptf to an iShares S&amp;P500 ETF, they tried with less than 5% of the total ptf. \n\nThey got familiar with ETFs and in the second half of 2020 they agreed to restructure their whole allocation: throughout 2020 they moved from the original 75/25 allocation to a less conservative 50/50. They also agreed to move half of their Mutual Fund ptf into ETFs. \n\nToday both the \"actively managed\" Mutual Fund ptf and the passive ETF ptf have a 50/50 allocation of Equity and Bonds. Actually there's a 5% Gold ETF which I consider part of the 50% \"non equity\" allocation. \n\nThe Mutual Fund half is kind of a black box, a multitude of funds of which I have little control over. I just know it's 50/50 Equity/Bond\n\nThe ETF ptf is structured as follows: \n50% Equity which boils down to a total market index.\n5% Gold. \n45% Fixed Income portion is more nuanced:\n\n20% Eur and US Corporate High Yield,\n5% Emerging Market Govies, \n10% China Govies\n5% Investment Grade Euro Corporate\n5% Investment Grade Euro Govies\n\nThat said, given the state pension and their relatively low current expenses does it make sense to have such a large portion of bond? \n\nWhat would you do? \n\nI was thinking to make them withdraw whatever is needed throughout the years from the Mutual Fund half, specifically from the fixed income portion. Thus targeting in 5-10 years a more aggressive 70/30 or 80/20. \n\nDoes it make sense? \n\nThanks all for your input on this and apologies for the long post.",
