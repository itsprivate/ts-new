This has been the most expensive mistake I have ever made. Advice needed on what to do now and where do I go from here. I want to sell off these accounts and go to ETFs. I still can not wrap my head around the fact that I am on the hook adding 50k to my tax burden for 2021 when I did not make that money in income. I'm guessing there is no way to mitigate this tax burden so what is my course of action now. Since I am stupid kindly advise me like I am 5.
