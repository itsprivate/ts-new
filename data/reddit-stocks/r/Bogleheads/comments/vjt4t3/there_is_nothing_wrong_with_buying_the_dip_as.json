How is this possible you may ask? Doesnt that mean you are keeping money out of the market? That is timing the market! Booooo! Booooo!\n\nWell the answer is simple. I have been keeping my lump sum into the market exactly the same as I always keep it. I havent changed my 401k contribution, my HSA contribution, or my weekly taxable brokerage contribution. Instead what I am doing is adjusting the 50/30/20 formula. Which is 50% on needs 30% on wants and 20% on savings. I have tweaked this to minimize my wants by minimizing my purchases and taking that extra money and dumping it into the market. I am going out to eat to dinner less than I usually would and spending less of my money on frivolous products. That TV I wanted can wait a few more months. I cannot and wont do this forever of course but while the market is down it is always smart to take advantage of it. \n\nThat is how you buy the dip in the Bogle way. There is no need to get snarky with someone for keeping their money on the sidelines or keeping dry powder. This is not a cult where we have to ostracize people for \"violating the rules\", it is simply some guidelines from a smart man about how to easily make enough money for retirement.
