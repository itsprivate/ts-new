  "selftext": "Hello Bogleheads,\n\nI thought I'd share my investment strategy for my childrens' college savings funds. I think it's important to have a written strategy for an investment that's as long and important as this, to be a guide during periods of fear and uncertainty.\n\nYour feedback is welcome, as I'm following the principles of this community, and I'm putting my trust in the stock market after being a lifelong cash hoarder!\n\n***TL;DR***: I plan to move my childrens' college savings ($480K) from cash savings accounts to index funds (VTI/VXUS or FSKAX/FTIHX) given the long time horizon of 17 years.\n\n**Situation**\n\n* Projected college costs ($480K) are secured in cash\n* 401(k) contributions are maximized\n* Emergency fund is secured in cash\n* Short-term savings are secured in cash\n* Only debts are mortgages of primary home (3.75% interest) and vacation home (2.875% interest)\n* Current age: 33\n\n**Goals**\n\n* For each of 3 children, fully fund 4 years of in-state college costs, referencing a preferred college as the baseline for costs.\n* Avoid borrowing any student loans to fund college costs.\n* Maximize tax advantages of 529 plans.\n* Move any surplus gains from college investment funds to retirement funds.\n\n**Time horizon**\n\n* First withdrawal in **7 years** (2028)\n* Last withdrawal in **17 years** (2037)\n\n**Opportunity**\n\nThe long time horizon presents an opportunity to grow the current college savings fund by investing in equities, and then moving the surplus gains to retirement funds. The amount gained could be hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the amount gained would be significantly higher when the investments are made earlier. As long as the return over 17 years is greater than the current cash savings rates of 0.25%, which is likely in the equities market over 17 years, then this is the best option to achieve this opportunity.\n\n**Risks Analysis**\n\n* **Scenario: Stock market declines temporarily early in the investment period** - College funds could fall initially. ***Holding and investing*** into shares during the downturn could stimulate growth in the following recovery. Use discretionary income and vested stock options to invest if needed.\n* **Scenario: Stock market declines temporarily later in the investment period** - College funds could grow earlier in the investment period, providing a safety net for downturns later in the investment period. ***Hold and invest*** into shares for non-529 accounts, and expect shares in 529 accounts to be depleted early. Use discretionary income and vested stock options to invest if needed.\n* **Scenario: Stock market stagnates throughout the investment period** - College funds will remain steady. Because the college funds started with the total amount needed, they will remain at the amount needed.\n* **Scenario: Stock market declines throughout the investment period** - Current college funds could become insufficient, in which case fall back onto safety nets (see below). ***Hold and invest*** into shares for non-529 accounts, and expect shares in 529 accounts to be depleted early. Given the long time horizon (**17 years**), a bear market of this length could indicate systemic problems that impose lifestyle changes that we can’t foresee. The longest period of stagnation in recent history was the \"Lost Decade,\" where the S&P 500 fell from its peak in early 2000 (the beginning of the Dot Com crash) until early 2013 (the full recovery from housing market crash), which was a time horizon of **13 years**. A systemic problem of this magnitude could affect supply and demand in ways that create new situations, such as the burst of the college tuition costs bubble or the devaluation of college degrees. Regulations could be passed in ways that address new challenges faced by student finances, or they could make financing more difficult. Ultimately, this is a situation where we can't guarantee stability even with cash, thus the investment strategy shouldn't plan around it.\n* **Scenario: Higher than average inflation throughout the investment period** - Inflation could rise more than expected. Keeping college funds in cash over a long time horizon could cause the funds to lose value faster than usual. Invest in equities to maximize gains and beat inflation.\n* **Scenario: College funds in 529 accounts grow too much and incur penalties** - Err on the side of putting too little money into the 529 accounts. The tax savings is less than the potential gains of the stock market.\n\n**Safety Nets**\n\nIn order of preference:\n\n* Investment gains from non-529 accounts\n* Over $350,000 in unvested stocks at employer\n* Option for student loans\n* Over $100,000 in equity (after remaining debt) in vacation home\n\n**Investment Strategy**\n\n* **Invest in equities** - Because college is fully funded as of 2021, the only risk is losing that money and its safety nets. Expect >0.25% growth in the equities market over the long time horizon (7 to 17 years). ***Hold and invest*** into shares during downturns. Use discretionary income and vested stock options to invest if needed.\n* **Invest in total market index funds** - These are diversified across industry sectors and  capitalization sizes. They offer much lower expense ratios than actively managed funds, while offering comparable performance.\n* **Favor US equities** - 70% US (VTI or FSKAX), 30% International (VXUS or FTIHX).\n* **Invest a portion in 529 accounts** - Take advantage of the tax savings offered by these accounts.\n* **Favor non-529 accounts** - Err on the side of investing too little invested into the 529 accounts, and invest the rest into non-529, to avoid incurring penalties of overfunding the 529 accounts.",
