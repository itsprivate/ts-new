And those people have irretrievably damaged themselves.\n\n&gt; I began to understand this point 10 or 15 years ago, but now I'm convinced: When you've won the game, why keep playing it?\n\n&gt; How risky stocks are to a given investor depends upon which part of the life cycle he or she is in. For a younger investor, stocks aren't as risky as they seem. For the middle-aged, they're pretty risky. And for a retired person, they can be nuclear-level toxic.”\n\nThe reason why stocks aren't very risky for a young person is that you have a lot of “human capital” (ability to make money working) left. On the eve of retirement, you don't have any of that.\n\nGood luck and stay the course! ⛵️",
