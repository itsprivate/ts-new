Bumps are large. But we get over them.\n2. In our foolish focus on the short-term stock market distractions of the moment, we, too, often overlook thislong history\n3. It is dangerous...to apply to the future inductive arguments based on past experience\n4. In the short-term, stock prices go up only when the expectations of investors rise, not necessarily when sales, margins, or profits rise\n5. ignore the short-term noise of the emotions reflected in our financial markets and focus on the productive long-term economics of our corporate businesses\n6. The true investor . . . will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies.”\n7. When there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the simplest one\n8. owning the stock market over the long term is a winner’s game, beating the stock market is a loser’s game.\n9. over the long term, the miracle of compounding returns is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs\n10. The winning formula for success in investing is owning the entire stock market through an index fund, and then doing nothing. Just stay the course\n11. The greatest Enemies of the Equity investor are Expenses and Emotions\n12. Fund returns are devastated by costs, taxes, and inflation\n13. SELECTING WINNING FUNDS in advance is more difficult than it looks\n14. Even funds with solid long-term records go out of business\n15. a fat wallet is the enemy of superior returns\n16. Before you rush out to invest in these three funds with such truly remarkable long-term records, think about the next 35 years\n17. “Don’t look for the needle in the hays tack. Just buy the hays tack!”\n18. there is simply no way to assure success by picking the funds that will beat the market, even by looking to their past performance over the long term. In fund performance, the past is rarely prologue avoid per- formance chasing based on short-term returns,especially during great bull markets.\n19. “Buying funds based purely on their past performance is one of the stupidest things an investor can do.”\n20. you can be more successful in selecting winning funds by focusing, not on the inevitable evanescence of past performance, but on something that seems to go on forever or, more fairly, a factor that has persisted over all the fund industry’s long history.\n21. the more the managers and brokers take, the less the investors make\n22. Hold Index Funds That Own the Entire Stock Market.\n23. Do your best to diversify to the nth degree; minimize your investment expenses; and focus your emotions where they cannot wreak the kind of havoc that most other people\n24. All index funds are not created equal\n25. Your index fund should not be your manager’s cash cow. It should be your own cash cow.\n26. In inefficient markets, the most successful managers may achieve unusually large returns. But common sense tells us that for each big success, there must also be a big failure.\n27. Indexing stock market sectors, a strong idea. Betting on stock market sectors, a weak reality.\n28. Always avoid bond funds with sales loads. smart investors will save themselves lots of money—and substantially improve their returns—if they apply the same principles of broad diversifi- cation, low-cost, no-load, minimal turnover, and long-term investing when they select fixed income funds\n29. Never think you know more than the market. Nobody does.\n30. “The greatest enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan.” Stick to the good plan.\n31. If you like the idea of sector ETFs, use the appropriate ones,don’t trade them, and use them in the right way— sparingly,and only to diversify your portfolio.\n32. “Unsoundly managed funds can produce spectacular but largely illusionary profits for a while, followed inevitably by calamitous losses\n33. “the real money in investment will have to be made—as most of it has been made in the past—not out of buying and selling but of owning and holding securities, receiving\n34. I see no reason why investors should be content with results inferior to those of an indexed fund.\n35. The two sources of the superior returns of the index fund:(1) the broadest possible diversification; and (2) the tiniest possible costs.\n36. smart investors ought to figure out for themselves that pouring money into hot funds in hot markets, and pulling money out of those funds when they turn cool, often in cold markets, is a loser’s game\n37. Over the short run, illusory speculative returns, caused by the impact of the change in the amount investors are willing to pay for each dollar of corpo- rate earnings, can increase or decrease investment returns. But in the long run, the impact of specula- tive return washes out\n38. The best protection for individual investors from the risks inherent in individual stocks is the broadest possible diversification.\n39. In your Serious Money Account, 50 percent to 95 percent in classic index funds. In your Funny Money Account, not one penny more than 5 percent.\n40. We know that we must start to invest at the earliest possible moment, and continue to put money away regularly from then on.\n41. We know that investing entails risk. But we also know that not investing dooms us to financial failure.\n42. We know the sources of returns in the stock and bond markets, and that’s the beginning of wisdom.\n43. We know that the risk of selecting specific securities, as well as the risk of selecting both managers and investment styles, can be eliminated by the total diversification offered by the classic index fund. Only market risk remains.\n44. We know that costs matter, overpoweringly in the long run, and we know that we must minimize them.\n45. We also know that taxes matter, and that they, too, must be minimized.)\n46. We know that alternative asset classes such as hedge funds aren’t really alternative, but simply pools of capital that invest—or overinvest or disinvest—in the very stocks and bonds that comprise the portfolio of the typical investor.\n47. We know what we don’t know. We can never be certain how our world will look tomorrow, and we know far less about how it will look a decade hence. But with intelligent asset allocation",
