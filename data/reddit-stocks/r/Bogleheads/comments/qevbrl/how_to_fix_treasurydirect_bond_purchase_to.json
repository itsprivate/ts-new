  "selftext": "I opened an individual account at TreasuryDirect to purchase I-Bonds.  That was fine, but when I went to purchase bonds, I made an error.  Since there is no clear way to add a beneficiary or a joint owner when you purchase bonds, I registered my I-Bonds as a \"sole\" owner.  That was a mistake!  For couples out there, what you should try to do is when you purchase bonds within your individual account, click on \"add registration\" to add a registration that is for both you AND your spouse.  Your spouse may be a beneficiary or a secondary owner.  I chose to register our bonds as secondary owners so that we can both have access to the funds.  If you do this correctly, your name a social security number will be listed, then the word \"WITH\" followed by your spouse's name.\n\nIf, like me, you already registered your bonds individually, changing this is surprisingly easy.  Here are the instructions from the website:\n\n## How do I add a secondary owner or beneficiary to my securities?\n\nAdding a secondary owner or beneficiary to securities registered in single ownership form is simple in TreasuryDirect. You can edit securities being held in Current Holdings; however, you cannot edit savings bonds held in your Gift Box. Securities in a Conversion Linked account (CLA) must first be transferred to a primary or another linked account in order to add a secondary owner.\n\nYour electronic savings bonds and marketable securities may be registered in your name alone, your name with a secondary owner, or your name with a beneficiary. Each registrant's taxpayer identification number must be shown.  Note:  Registrations in entity accounts may not name a secondary owner or beneficiary.  All securities in an entity account carry a registration identical to the entity account name.\n\nTo add a secondary owner or beneficiary to your securities registered in single ownership form:\n\n* Log into your primary TreasuryDirect® account.\n* Click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.\n* Under the heading Manage My Securities click **\"Edit\"** a registration.\n* On the Edit Security Registration page, choose the security type you want to edit and click **\"Select\"**.\n* On the Summary page, choose the security or securities you wish to edit and click **\"Select\"** (you may edit up to 50 securities to the same registration).\n* On the Detail page, select the registration containing the secondary owner or beneficiary you desire from the drop-down box. (If you've never created the registration, you can do so by clicking **\"Add New Registration\"**. Once you've created the new registration, the system will bring you back to the Detail page where you'll find the new registration listed in the drop-down box.) Note: Entity accounts may only have one registration. All securities in an entity account carry a registration identical to the entity account name.\n* Once you've selected the desired registration, click **\"Submit\"** to complete the change in registration for the security.",
