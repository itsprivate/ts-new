  "selftext": "I'm 32 years old, single, no kids. The biggest goal that I'm working on is to have the option to be able to retire sometime in the next 10-15 years. I could obviously choose to work longer since I'll only be 42-47, but it feels like complete early retirement, going to something part-time, or changing jobs to something that's more rewarding/impactful than my current job but for less money is possible based on what I currently have saved and what I'm putting away each month when I use compound interest calculators and project out the next few years. My goal is to reach $1-$1.25M and maintain a real-spending level of \\~$45,000 (4% SWR). I make around $100K after-tax now so I'm saving \\~50% of my after-tax income. \n\nI have \\~$210K invested right now between my 401K, ROTH IRA, and brokerage account. See below for the portfolio breakdown and how much I'm contributing to all of them: \n\nBrokerage Account: $178K (72% S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV), 16% U.S. Mid Cap ETF (IJH), 7% U.S. Small Cap ETF (IJR), 5% International ETF (IXUS)). Auto-contributing $1,000 per week ($52K per year) based on this same allocation. This is my main account right now as you'll see from my relatively small 401K balance since my employer only matches the first 2% and we've failed the income discrimination test the last two years so I'm even getting that back at the end of each year. I'm also over the income limit to contribute to my ROTH IRA. This will be my main source of income in retirement (early and full).\n\nROTH IRA: $27K. (74% VTI, 18% VXUS, 5% IYR, 3% VNQI). Not contributing any more since I'm over the income limit. \n\n401K: $5K. 100% S&amp;P 500 Mutual Fund. Only putting 2% of my income to get the employer match but we've failed the income discrimination test the last two years so I'll probably be getting this back too.\n\n \n\nOverall, then, it's 92% U.S. stock ETFs, 6.5% international stock ETFs, and 1.5% Real Estate ETFs. If I were a 50-55 year old person with the goal of retiring at 65, I feel like the conventional wisdom would be to allocate my portfolio more towards bonds, but I just can't bring myself to do that. Should I do it anyway? Or go with a 2035-2040 Target date fund? I feel like mentally I can withstand the downturns between now and then. I've DCA'ed all the way through the past three years including COVID and the last 6-8 months and never been tempted to sell anything or change my strategy so I have a high risk tolerance. If anything, I actually get excited when I see prices going down. \n\nI always assume 8% growth but when I saw the graph below that says that I could still reach $935K in 10 years at 4% returns, that got me thinking about reallocation and potentially being a little safer to avoid another 25-30% downturn right around the time I'm ready to think about early retirement. I know the Boglehead advice would also say that I'm too heavily allocated in the U.S. but what other advice would you have or what would you do in my situation? Is my portfolio too aggressive or stock-heavy?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vb916je0cke91.jpg?width=668&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34465a958514b1a8c1dada5aa03cea49c0fcbc2d",
