I've bought plenty of stocks and not withdrawn a cent.  I've known about the Boglehead way for a good few years and *know it's the smart thing to do*, but I've had that inherent internal bias of hope in wanting to  accumulate wealth faster by being smarter than something so simple as a three fund portfolio.  \n\nIdiot, but *self-aware idiot,* nonetheless.\n\nFast forward to now, and the epiphany has happened and I've decided to move to the Boglehead way and consolidate.  Hoorah. Between 401ks/Roth IRAs etc. I  have approx:  \n\n\n* 375k Vanguards - Several Vanguard funds that I'll need to re-balance, no issues here\n* 250k employer stocks - Vest over next 3 years, I get 50k next month, I'll slowly re-balance in to three fund as they vest, no issues here\n\nBoom - I'm on my Boglehead journey!\n\nHowever, I then have $100k in my own stocks, that i've purchased over the years from either silly [fool.com](https://fool.com) articles, to my own ideas or speculation.  Yes its of course tech heavy (zzZ), I've made lots on APPL, GOOG, AMZN, TSLA, etc.  and it's hard to not feel I'm doing great despite reminding myself I've invested over a period the market has been booming.\n\nI'm worried I'm having a fallacy effect in wanting to maybe only get rid of those stupid [fool.com](https://fool.com) picks and what not, but still have a little bit of \"play stock\" for those stocks that do seem to continue to perform well for me.  Of the $100k I'm thinking maybe move 50k in to the the 3 fund and then keep the other 50k of my high performers.  But by definition, this way I know is not Boglehead because it skews the diversification (and simplicity).\n\n**Did anyone else find this a predicament and have an almost bond with their individual company stocks? Did all of you just sell all pre-existing stocks when you decided to move to three fund/lazy, or did you keep hold of some?**\n\nSorry for the ramble.  Yes, I'm an over-thinker.",
