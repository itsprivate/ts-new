These are just guidelines and your specific situation can change these.  The steps below describe how to build your portfolio.  \n\nAnd the optimal portfolio can only be known in retrospect.  So, no one on this subreddit or anywhere else can tell you what will do best.  So don't bother asking those types of questions.  No one knows....  and if they actually did.....\n\n1.\tIf they actually know what is going to happen, they wouldn’t tell anyone.  They would be managing a hedge fund making Billions of dollars flying on a private jet with some supermodel.  Not posting responses to you on Reddit.  You know how much money I could make managing pensions if I could time the market reliably?\n\nThe Little Book of Common Sense Investing\n\n-\tAsset allocation accounts for 94% of return. 2 factors that determine how you should allocate your portfolio\n  - Ability to take risk – depends on financial position, liabilities, years. In general, you are able to take more risks the longer time horizon you have\n  - Willingness to take risk – matter of preference. Some investors can handle the up and downs. If you can&amp;#39;t sleep at night, you have too much risk.\n  - These two factors determine your risk tolerance\n\nAll About Asset Allocation\n\n-\tgood idea is to decide on a static percentage of stocks, bonds, alternative investments that fit your needs and then maintain that allocation for a long, long, long time. Then rebalance as needed.\n\nRational Expectations\n\n-\tHow to design a portfolio in order of importance\n  1. Decide on your AA mix of risk(stock) and riskless(bonds)\n  2. Then decide how much of your risk assets do your want in US, Developed, Emerging\n  3. How much do I want to tilt toward factors? Small, Value, Momentum, Quality, etc.\n  4. How much exposure do I want to &amp;quot;ancillary asset classes&amp;quot; such as REITS, PME, and Natural resource stocks?\n-\tDepends on your tolerance for risk, your capacity for risk and your need for risk\n-\tIt is one thing to map out a portfolio strategy in a spreadsheet and quite another to execute it in the real world\n\n-\tAs the market falls, more and more people abandon their strategy\n\nStep 1\n\n-\tAsset Allocation\n  - The most important decision is the overall stock/bond mix. Start with the age = bond allocation rule of thumb\n  - Then you can adjust your equity allocation (+-20%) based on your risk tolerance. If you can handle high risk. Increase the equity portion by 20%. If you are scared of risk and losing money, reduce the equity portion by 20%.\n  - Example – 50-year-old could be anywhere between 50/50 if normal to 70/30 if high risk or 30/70 if lower risk\n  - Start with a basic domestic, foreign, bond portfolio (Boglehead 3 Fund Portfolio)\n\nIf You Can by William Bernstein (Boglehead 3 Fund Portfolio)\n\nhttps://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf\n\nWhat may change your Equity/Bond AA.  Only you can answer these questions.\n\n-\ttests for AA\n  - The ability to take risks\n    - Investment horizon\n    - Stability of income\n    - Need for liquidity\n    - Plan &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; options\n  - The willingness to take risks\n    - Can you sleep at night?\n  - The need to take risk\n    - If you &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; the game, stop playing\n-\tEquity vs Fixed\n  - Increase Equity\n    - Longer time horizon\n    - High level of job security\n    - High tolerance for risk\n    - Need for higher returns to meet goals\n    - Multiple streams of income (Pensions)\n    - High marginal utility of wealth\n    - Plan &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; options\n  - Opposite of above would be a higher allocation to fixed investments\n-\tAbility to take risks\n  - Investment horizon – longer horizon = more risk\n  - Stability of earned income – IE - CRNA = more risk, Oil field worker = less risk\n  - Need for liquidity – keep 6 months reserve cash\n  - Plan &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; options – more options = more risk\n-\tIf you have already &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; the game, why still play?\n-\tAA – Equity vs Fixed Income decisions\n  - Examples of higher AA to equity below\n  - Longer time horizon\n  - High level of job security\n  - High tolerance for risk\n  - Need for higher returns for financial goals\n  - Multiple streams of money – IE – pensions, SS, etc.\n  - Human capital left\n  - More options in case of a downturn\n-\tOur labor capital should play a role in your risk in your portfolio. More stable job = more risks in the portfolio. Less stable job = less risks in the portfolio.\n-\tTilting the portfolio adds the important consideration of tracking error regret. Tracking error is the amount by which a portfolios performance varies from that of the total market.  Can you tolerate this?\n\nStep 2\n\nDecide on your Equity portions to US, Developed and EM.  \n\n-\tInternational AA\n  - Very important especially if you live in the USA\n  - Don&amp;#39;t fall prey to &amp;quot;home country bias&amp;quot;\n  - Don&amp;#39;t hedge the currency in your international AA\n\nStep 3\n\nDecide on any factors you may want exposure to.  These include Value, Small, Momentum, Quality, Profitability, Liquidity, etc.\n\nReasons you may alter your exposure to factors\n\n-\tValue vs Growth\n  - Increase to value factor\n    - Increase expected return with increased risk\n    - Diversification of sources of risk\n  - Decrease to value or market portfolio\n    - Reduced risk\n    - Tracking error regret\n    - An owner of a value company. Example – A person whose job is in cyclical business. (Construction, Auto, etc.)\n-\t Small vs Large\n  - Increase to small factor\n    - Increased expected return with increased risk\n    - Stable human capital\n    - Diversification of sources of risk\n  - Decrease or market portfolio\n    - Less stable human capital\n    - Lower risk\n    - You work in a small business\n\nStep 4\n\nDecide on any alternative asset classes you may want.  These include REIT’s, Precious Metal Equity, Gold, Natural Resource Stocks, Commodity Futures, etc.  \n\nWhen to change your AA\n\n-\tReasons to change your AA\n  - Financial goal is well within reach (if you won the game, quit playing)\n  - You realize you will not need all your money during your lifetime\n  - You risk tolerance isn&amp;#39;t what you thought it was\n-\tAny AA changes should require deep thinking and even-handed judgement. Don&amp;#39;t make changes during times of duress\n\nInvestors Manifesto\n\n-\tIf you must change your allocations, do so very slowly and infrequently, by very little, and always in a contrarian manner\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t get too cute with your allocations. Keep them fairly constant over the long haul, and don&amp;#39;t count on reversion to the mean to increase your returns by very much\n\n4 Pillars\n\nPutting it all together – Assembling the 4 Pillars\n\n-\tIf you want to retire comfortably, you must save a lot\n-\tThe easiest way to get rich is to spend as little as possible\n-\tManage all of your assets as one portfolio so you can easily see what is going on\n-\tYou should plan on spending at a maximum, the expected real return of your portfolio each year. IE – 4% expected return = 4% withdraw\n-\tDuring the next 20 or 30 years, there will be a single, best allocation that in retrospect we will have wished we owned. The only problem is we don&amp;#39;t know which one that is. The safest idea therefore is to own as many asset classes as possible\n-\tRebalancing over long term has an estimated benefit of 0.5% per year\n-\tRebalance every year or two. Try to do it with distributions and not selling assets\n-\tIn a taxable account, rebalance with distributions (dividends, contributions, etc.)\n-\tIn retirement, sell your best performers to rebalance\n-\t&amp;quot;More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun&amp;quot;\n\nIAA\n\n-\tA The Three-Step Approach\n  - How many different asset classes do I want to own?\n  - How &amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot; of a portfolio do I want?\n  - How much risk can I and do I want to take?\n    - How much complexity can you tolerate and tracking error?\n    - The law of diminishing returns applies to asset classes. You get a diversification boost from the first several, after that, you are just amusing yourself\n-\tExamples of various AA based on complexity\n-\tLevel 1 AA\n  - Large Cap US\n  - Large Cap Foreign Stocks\n  - Short Term US Bonds\n    - Level 1B\n      - Small Cap US\n-\tLevel 2 AA\n  - Large Cap US\n  - Foreign Large Cap\n  - Small Cap US\n  - Small Cap Foreign\n  - Emerging Market\n  - REITs\n  - Short Term US Bonds\n    - Level 2B\n      - Precious metal equity\n      - International Bonds\n-\tLevel 3 AA\n  - Everything in level 2 but tilt toward value stocks\n    - Level 3B\n      - Precious Metals Stocks, Natural Resources, Utilities\n      - Specific nations equity or bonds\n-\tThe more complex your AA, the more tracking error you will get vs the index (Like the S+P 500). You have to ask yourself how much will that bother you?\n  - Tracking error means that your portfolio will behave very differently than everyone else&amp;#39;s\n  - If that bothers you, then you need a simpler portfolio. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, then you can be more complex.\n    - Increasing the number of asset classes will improve diversification but will also increase your work and tracking error\n-\tIt is impossible to forecast future optional portfolios by any technique\n-\tOur precise AA will depend on three factors\n  - Tolerance to tracking error\n  - Number of assets you wish to own\n  - Tolerance for risk\n-\tTwo types of investors, those who don&amp;#39;t know where the market is headed, and those who don&amp;#39;t know that they don&amp;#39;t know\n-\tSticking by your AA policy through thick and thin I much more important than picking a &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; AA\n-\tBut in real life risks, returns, and correlations of various assets fluctuate considerably over time\n\nWinning the Loser’s Game\n\n-\tDevelop an investment policy for yourself and then follow it\n-\tToo often investment policy is too vague and is left to be resolved in haste when distressing market conditions are present. This is when it is too easy to make the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.\n-\tThe best shield against the disruption of the markets short term provocations is understanding and knowledge.\n-\tPut your investment policy in writing so you will follow it when times are bad\n\nStocks for the Long Run\n\n-\tStructuring a portfolio\n  - Buy and Hold a diversified portfolio of stocks\n  - Forgo any forecasting ability\n  - Don&amp;#39;t let emotions get in your way\n  - Keep transaction costs low\n  - Keep your expectations in line with history. 6-7% real return with a 15 P/E.\n  - Stock returns are more stable over the long run. They protect against inflation\n  - Based on the above, you should keep an overwhelming portion in equities\n  - Invest the largest portion in low cost index funds\n  - Invest at least 1/3 of your portfolio in international stocks\n  - Establish firm rules to keep your portfolio on track. The temptation to buy when everyone else is bullish and sell when everyone else is bearish are hard to resist\n\nAsset Allocation\n\n-\tDesigning an investment portfolio has several steps (Investment Policy)\n  - Deciding which assets to include\n  - Determining the long-term target % of the portfolio to allocate to each of these asset classes\n    - The first 2 steps determine the portfolios volatility and return characteristics\n  - Specifying a range for each asset class for which it can be altered to exploit opportunities\n    - Minimum and Maximum limits are set for each asset class\n    - This is the &amp;quot;market timing&amp;quot; portion of the portfolio\n  - Selecting the securities within each asset class\n\nIf you don't know what you are doing and just want to get started.  My recommendation is a Boglehead 3 fund Portfolio or a TDF.  If you want to get more complicated than that.  You need to read some books.  I have plenty of resources below to get you started.  \n\nMy book summaries have information to help you decide your portfolio AA\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50/comments/rnftyk/book_summaries/",

You get a diversification boost from the first several, after that, you are just amusing yourself&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Examples of various AA based on complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Level 1 AA\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Large Cap US&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Large Cap Foreign Stocks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Short Term US Bonds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 1B\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Small Cap US&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Level 2 AA\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Large Cap US&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Foreign Large Cap&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Small Cap US&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Small Cap Foreign&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Emerging Market&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;REITs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Short Term US Bonds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 2B\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Precious metal equity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;International Bonds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Level 3 AA\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Everything in level 2 but tilt toward value stocks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 3B\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Precious Metals Stocks, Natural Resources, Utilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specific nations equity or bonds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  The more complex your AA, the more tracking error you will get vs the index (Like the S+P 500). You have to ask yourself how much will that bother you?\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tracking error means that your portfolio will behave very differently than everyone else&amp;#39;s&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If that bothers you, then you need a simpler portfolio. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, then you can be more complex.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Increasing the number of asset classes will improve diversification but will also increase your work and tracking error&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  It is impossible to forecast future optional portfolios by any technique&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Our precise AA will depend on three factors\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tolerance to tracking error&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Number of assets you wish to own&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tolerance for risk&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Two types of investors, those who don&amp;#39;t know where the market is headed, and those who don&amp;#39;t know that they don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Sticking by your AA policy through thick and thin I much more important than picking a &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; AA&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  But in real life risks, returns, and correlations of various assets fluctuate considerably over time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Winning the Loser’s Game&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Develop an investment policy for yourself and then follow it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Too often investment policy is too vague and is left to be resolved in haste when distressing market conditions are present. This is when it is too easy to make the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  The best shield against the disruption of the markets short term provocations is understanding and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Put your investment policy in writing so you will follow it when times are bad&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stocks for the Long Run&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Structuring a portfolio\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buy and Hold a diversified portfolio of stocks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Forgo any forecasting ability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let emotions get in your way&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep transaction costs low&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep your expectations in line with history. 6-7% real return with a 15 P/E.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stock returns are more stable over the long run. They protect against inflation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Based on the above, you should keep an overwhelming portion in equities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Invest the largest portion in low cost index funds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Invest at least 1/3 of your portfolio in international stocks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish firm rules to keep your portfolio on track. The temptation to buy when everyone else is bullish and sell when everyone else is bearish are hard to resist&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asset Allocation&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Designing an investment portfolio has several steps (Investment Policy)\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deciding which assets to include&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Determining the long-term target % of the portfolio to allocate to each of these asset classes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The first 2 steps determine the portfolios volatility and return characteristics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specifying a range for each asset class for which it can be altered to exploit opportunities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Minimum and Maximum limits are set for each asset class&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is the &amp;quot;market timing&amp;quot; portion of the portfolio&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Selecting the securities within each asset class&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know what you are doing and just want to get started.  My recommendation is a Boglehead 3 fund Portfolio or a TDF.  If you want to get more complicated than that.  You need to read some books.  I have plenty of resources below to get you started.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My book summaries have information to help you decide your portfolio AA&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50/comments/rnftyk/book_summaries/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50/comments/rnftyk/book_summaries/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
