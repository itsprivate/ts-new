For my “savings account”, I would just put some of the money into treasury bills. To withdraw cash from the ATM I would have a minimum balance in the Fidelity Cash Management Account (or I could just use overdraft protection so I wouldn’t have to keep a balance, Fidelity Cash Management isn’t as good as a Fidelity brokerage account since the core position has to be in a FDIC product which has a lower yield, but the Fidelity Government money market is risk free anyways since it is invested in treasuries). Then I could set up bill pay and all that jazz from the Fidelity brokerage. I feel like this is superior to having an Ally checking / saving where the checking yields 0.1% and the savings yield 1%. I also end up getting free wire transfers and super fast ACH with Fidelity as well. Any thoughts?",
