She probably put all cash into it at the time but then after that never did anything with any of her contributions.\n\nI’ve set up the account (Fidelity) online so I can look at it. Right now, the account is sitting at about 7k in this TDF (2020 I believe) and about 60k in cash. Looking for some advice on what to put the cash in for her.\n\nShe is 67, works at a grocery store, does not collect social security yet, and bought a home last year on I believe a 30 year mortgage. She doesn’t have much extra cash to invest but she tries to put in several thousand to her IRA each year. She talks about retirement but honestly I don’t see it financially.\n\nLooking for some advice for what she could do with some of the cash sitting in the Roth IRA. I am 34 so my investing timeline is different and don’t think it’s right for me to set hers up like mine (all stock).\n\nPlease let me know if more info is needed. Thanks!",
