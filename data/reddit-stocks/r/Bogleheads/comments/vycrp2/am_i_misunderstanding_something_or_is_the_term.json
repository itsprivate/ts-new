Feel free to redirect me to another subreddit more suited for this sort of content.\n\n--- \n\n\nGoogling \"efficient market hypothesis,\" [the following definition from *Investopedia*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp) appears (emphasis added):\n\n\n&gt; The efficient market hypothesis (EMH), alternatively known as the efficient market theory, is a hypothesis that states that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible.\n\n\n\n&gt; **According to the EMH, stocks always trade at their fair value on exchanges**, making it impossible for investors to purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. Therefore, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and the only way an investor can obtain higher returns is by purchasing riskier investments.\n\n\n\nThe idea that the EMH implies consistent alpha generation is impossible is true, but the reasoning here seems off. Specifically at the bolded part, there's a claim that stock prices, according to the EMH, always represent fair value (which I think refers to intrinsic value, such as present value of all future cash flows). \n\n\n\n\nBut this isn't what the EMH actually says, right? Obviously stock prices aren't always a reflection of any sort of intrinsic/fair value; speculative bubbles are a testament to that. As far as I know, the (semi-strong) EMH simply states that no (publicly available) information can be used to predict stock price movements. **The EMH accepts that a stock can be mispriced relative to its intrinsic/fair value, but it claims that there is no sure way of determining 1) how exactly it's mispriced and 2) when the market would correct the stock price.**\n\n\nDon't take my word for it. Malkiel in *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* says the following:\n\n&gt; The efficient-market hypothesis does not imply, as some critics have proclaimed, that stock prices are always correct. In fact, stock prices are always wrong. What EMH implies is that no one knows for sure if stock prices are too high or too low.\n\n\n\nGiven all this, isn't the term \"efficient market hypothesis\" incredibly misleading? Sure, the actual hypothesis states that markets are efficient in pricing in any/all (publicly available) information, but the term itself implies that markets can never misprice any asset. This is why seemingly 90% of EMH critics always bring up 2008 or GME as evidence against the EMH, even though neither of those two examples disprove the actual theory. I'd say both proponents of the EMH and academics in general would benefit from an alternate name for the EMH.",
