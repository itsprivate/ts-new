Ever. I wasn't encouraged to invest, I was never taught the value of investing, my parents never discussed investing in front of me... absolutely no interest in investing was ever on display. Not only did this inform my approach to investing, it also informed my approach to people with wealth (which neither of my parents were). It never occurred to me that patiently investing for decades—specifically in low-cost index funds—was a path to becoming wealthy. That that was an option for me. We just regarded wealthy individuals with an unspoken \"Good for them, but that's not happening for us.\" We approached investing as something we mutually agreed was beyond our understanding. There are people who can make investing work for them, and then there are people who cannot, and we were those who could not, and that was that. \n\nI personally thought this way a lot longer than I should have, and I know I'm far from alone in committing that error. I'm a Boglehead now, but I wanted to understand the major underlying reason why I wasn't before, and why many people are not. I speak for myself here, but I think this might be true of other people: **I did not actively want to consider the idea that my freedom was something I had to buy, and I did not want to actively conceive of myself as someone who isn't free.** Because if I do that, that means I have to look at myself as someone who is not free, and I have to look at the myriad of ways that I'm not free. I realize it was emotionally easier to delude myself into the idea that I am free as an excuse to look away from the reality that I am not free, and that becoming free is going to take patience, time, and unwavering commitment.\n\n**Boglehead philosophy is invaluable to me because it's the first time I was encouraged to think about the future value of money, and it's focused on being able to buy the most important thing: my freedom.** Once I grasped that, everything else fell into place for me emotionally, and I don't fall for many of the traps that I used to.\n\nFor example, I've seen the question posed: how do you emotionally handle the idea of the stock market dropping tomorrow and watching your net worth drop? That's easy: I remind myself that I'm not investing for tomorrow. I'm investing for a 30-40 year horizon. Therefore, regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow, the best time to buy low-cost index funds to provide for my future is still now.\n\nAnyway, my questions for you all: before you were a Boglehead, how did you used to think about money? Did your parents encourage you to see the value in investing, or is that something you had to learn on your own? Did you used to have a toxic relationship with money? If so, how?",
