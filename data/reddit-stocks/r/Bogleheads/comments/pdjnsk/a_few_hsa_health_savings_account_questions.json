I currently have a 401k, Roth IRA, and brokerage account; I had researched HSA's but put them on the back burner for a bit until I understood them better.  I have read \"Health Savings Accounts for Dummies\" and other information from Reddit and elsewhere, but I still have a few lingering questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  I reviewed my health insurance plan and I am in a HDHP, with deductibles of $1500 or greater -- based on this, I am eligible to open an HSA, correct?\n2. I was reviewing tax forms from 2020 and I received a form 5498-SA, which indicates that total contributions made in 2020 to my HSA were $500.  Does this mean that I have an HSA already and didn't realize this?  \n3. If I do have an HSA already, should I check with my employer to see if they have a \"cafeteria plan\" first?  From what I have read, I can have my employer make pre-tax contributions to the HSA if they have a cafeteria plan.  I assume I'd also want to know what my employer will be contributing to my HSA for 2021 to ensure I do not go over in contributions?\n4. If my employer does not have a \"cafeteria plan\" for my HSA, my plan is to open an account with Fidelity.  I assume the $500 contribution to my HSA for 2020 is somewhere, am I able to put the $500 that my employer apparently contributed in 2020 (and the $500 I assume they will contribute in 2021) in this account?\n\nThanks in advance for any and all help!  While I feel that I have an adequate understanding of 401k's, Roth IRA's, and brokerage accounts, HSA's still seem a bit confusing to me.",
