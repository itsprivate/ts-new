I'm convinced that low-cost ETFs and index funds would be the ideal investment instruments for me but I'm not sure about which ones to buy. \n\nI am aware of the 3 fund strategy of 1 SP500 / broad market US ETF; 1x international ETF, and a bond ETF.\n\nI'm 26, so I have a bigger appetite for risk and sticking with just the first two. \n\nBut I'm still unsure which exact products to buy. Would love to hear from other community members about their thoughts and recommended resources.\n\nMore info:\nI am an Indian citizen currently living in Switzerland, so don't have captial gains tax but taxed 30% on dividends. I work at a FAANG company with RSUs as a part of my compensation and an ESPP program that allows me to buy the company stock at 15% discount.\n\nThanks!",
