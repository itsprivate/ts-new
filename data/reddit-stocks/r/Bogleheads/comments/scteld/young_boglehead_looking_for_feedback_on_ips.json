I started working full time 5 years ago when I was 22, and have happily just met my initial 20's goals of paying off student loans (~30,000 after interest), replacing my old vehicle with a gently used one that can last me a good while, getting a solid emergency fund put together, and accumulating 1 years pay into retirement investments. I've done quite a bit of learning about personal finance this past year and am looking to make sure I have everything in place for future success, so any feedback from those further along than myself is welcome. \n\n                                            IPS\n\n\nCore Philosophy:\n\nThe Boglehead way – Keep costs low, be well diversified, and stay the course. The long term is what matters, and short-term market fluctuations are just noise. \n\nInvestment Objectives:\n\n1.\tBecome financially independent as soon as reasonably practical. Tentative goal of 45 - but given the difficulty of predicting circumstances decades into the future this number is subject to change as I approach it. A savings rate of 50% of net (post-tax) income or higher will be used to achieve this goal. \n\n2.\tProvide an annual income from investments of at least $30,000 per person, adjusted for inflation, at 3% safe withdrawal rate. To accomplish this I will seek to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged investment accounts, then put aside money for home ownership, and finally make use of a taxable brokerage account. \n\n\nRisk Tolerance: \n\nEvaluated via the Vanguard risk tolerance tool as high. Looking towards the future I will seek to include age, assets, proximity to FI goals, job security, and past investment experience to ensure my investment program is consistent with my risk tolerance. \n\nPortfolio:\n\nEmergency fund – 1.5 months expenses in cash, 6 months expenses in I-bonds. \n\nInvestments\n\n1.\tTotal US Stock Market – 60%\n2.\tTotal International Stock Market – 40%\n\nI will switch to 90% stocks/10% bonds at age 30 and periodically adjust bond holdings to be higher as I approach FI. Stock holdings will follow market weight. I will consider whether any tilts are appropriate once I have properly studied and understood them.  \n\nSelection Criteria:\n\nAll holdings will be placed in low cost, broadly diversified index mutual funds/ETF’s consistent with my portfolio goals whenever possible. Load bearing, high cost, actively managed funds are to be avoided. \n\nReview and Rebalancing: \n\nHoldings will be checked once per quarter to ensure there are no problems with my accounts. Rebalancing will be performed once every year or two in tax advantaged accounts, at my birthday. Taxable accounts will be considered when I actually have one. Rebalancing will only be done at the established time, and only to match my portfolio allocation goals. Market timing and performance chasing are not permitted. \n\n\nAnd there it is. Is there anything else to consider at this point, or am I good to sit back and stay the course until I start approaching my investment goals?",
