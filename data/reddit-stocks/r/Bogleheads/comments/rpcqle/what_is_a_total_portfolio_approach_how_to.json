  "selftext": "A lot of folks start by 'mirroring' allocations across accounts (e.g. holding 70/30 stocks bonds in taxable, *and* in their IRA *and* in their 401(k)), which can be OK ... *but* it can be simpler, cheaper, and more tax-efficient to **treat everything as one big portfolio**. There are a few good links in the sidebar about tax-efficient fund placement and a total-portfolio approach, but I just want to lay out some typical scenarios for reference -- hope these help!\n\n--------------\n\n**Investor A** is a **baseline case**, someone who has good investment options across all accounts \n\n* Target allocation: 70/30 stocks/bonds, 50/50 US/international within stocks (so: 35/35/30 US/intl/bonds).\n* Space available: 60% 401k, 20% Roth IRA, and 20% Taxable. \n\nFirst, hold a balance of things in the 401(k) so you can rebalance tax-free (some each of US/intl/bonds in the 401(k)). At the same time, high-growth things go well in a Roth, so fill that space up with stocks if possible. In the current rate environment, Series I/EE bonds, Treasuries, and TIPS are all OK in taxable (relatively efficient).\n\n**Solution A: diversify in the 401k and put risk assets in the Roth IRA**\n\n* 401(k): 25% US, 25% intl, 10% bonds\n* Roth IRA: 10% US, 10% intl\n* Taxable: 20% bonds\n\nThere isn't one single solution to this problem, but starting with either (1) high-risk in Roth, and/or (2) high diversification in the Traditional/401(k) both help frame what else goes where. (Note: historically, you'd want to do things a little differently, prioritizing bonds in the Traditional/401(k) account, but this is less key these days). Also note the framing: it's less a matter of percentages within an account than percentages on the whole.\n\n---------------------\n\n**Investor B** has similar goals, but **limited good 401k choices**: only one cheap (500 index) \n\n* Target allocation: 70/30 stocks/bonds, 50/50 US/international within stocks (so: 35/35/30 US/intl/bonds).\n* Space available: 30% 401k, 30% Roth IRA, and 40% Taxable. \n\nWork backward from available options. In this case: fill up the 401k with that US stock fund, since that's the only good choice; then buy mid/small to complete the US side in the Roth IRA, then fill the rest of the Roth with international (Roths grow tax-free forever, so high-growth options are preferable there), then put whatever's left in taxable.\n\n**Solution B: prioritize less expensive fund options and diversify in other accounts.**\n\n* 401(k): 30% US\n* Roth IRA: 5% US small/mid, 25% intl\n* Taxable: 10% intl, 30% bonds\n\nPretty straightforward in this case, but rebalancing may still be difficult. An alternative option would be to put a bit of bonds in the Roth IRA so you can rebalance there. That, or: rebalance with dividends and new money.\n\n--------------\n\n**Investor C** is in the same situation as investor (B), but with **diversification limitations due to 401k space** -- so they not only have just one cheap (500 index) fund, but the 401k is also their biggest account\n\n* Target allocation: 70/30 stocks/bonds, 50/50 US/international within stocks (so: 35/35/30 US/intl/bonds).\n* Space available: 50% 401k, 10% Roth IRA, and 40% Taxable. \n\nThis is where things get tricky. They could still fill up their 401(k) with US, but it would tilt them farther than they want. There's no one-size-fits-all solution here, so it's going to come down to the expense ratio over other options in the 401(k). So still start with the 401(k) to at least the 35% mark, then determine priorities based on costs. And keep in mind that a 401(k) isn't forever -- when you change employers, you can roll that account into a Traditional IRA and pick the funds you really want. A few ways you could handle things in the meantime:\n\nFor investor C, if the other options are just absurdly expensive, a 'for now' solution could look like this:\n\n**Solution C1: tilt for now, fix it later**\n\n* 401(k): 50% US\n* Roth IRA: 10% intl\n* Taxable: 10% intl, 30% bonds\n\nIf there's, say, a not-too-crazy bond fund option (e.g. 0.4% ER), or even a money market, this could work too:\n\n**Solution C2: accept slightly higher expenses for now, fix it later**\n\n* 401(k): 35% US, 15% bonds\n* Roth IRA: 10% intl\n* Taxable: 25% intl, 15% bonds\n\nPersonally, I would lean toward C2 because it will be more on track with the plan plus easier to rebalance within the 401k. Either way, examples like this one are clearly the trickiest, and every situation is different, but if you keep in mind the key points below you can make the best of your situation. Cheers!\n\n-------------------\n\n**Why not just have the same allocation in all accounts?** For one thing, while it looks simple, it can get confusing and be hard to rebalance. There is also tax drag from this approach. It's not world-ending if it's your best or only option, but it's suboptimal. Regardless, every situation is different, but here are some **key takeaways**\n\n* 1) **Keep expenses low** as much as possible, but weigh options if your 401(k) choices are limited\n* 2) **Prioritize diversification in a 401(k)** or other tax-advantaged account for tax-free rebalancing\n* 3) **Prioritize risk assets in the Roth IRA** since that growth will never be taxed\n* 4) **Treat everything as one big portfolio** -- this can help save you on taxes and expenses\n* 5) **Write down your plan** so if new money shows up you know where it fits into the grand scheme of things.\n\nP.S. I wrote out a lot of example numbers here and would bet money I got at least one wrong, so if you see an error, please feel free to point it out. If you can think of other typical situations I should help explain, LMK.",
