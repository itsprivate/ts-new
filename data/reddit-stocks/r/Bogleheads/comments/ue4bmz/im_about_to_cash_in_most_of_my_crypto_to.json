I've never really saved for retirement/my future, and I would like to start doing so.\n\n**Current assets:**\n\n* $30k emergency fund in a savings account with my credit union (just over 6 months worth)\n\n* $115k worth of crypto\n\nI want to diversify my assets so that there is less risk, and I was thinking of splitting my crypto in the following manner:\n\n**Keep some as crypto:**\n\n* Keep a little over one-third of it in an account with a company called Celsius, where you make 5.35% APY for your crypto sitting there, while they lend it out\n\n**Add to my emergency fund:**\n\n* Cash out about $18,000 and add it to my emergency fund so that I have a year's worth of expenses covered, and then move my entire emergency fund to a high-yield savings account (are there higher-earning places to park my emergency fund than a high-yield savings account, that are still liquid?) - Also, to note: I like the idea of having a larger emergency fund given my current job situation and the potential of a recession. Would hate to get laid off and then struggle to find work for a while without a large cushion.\n\n**More traditional investment vehicles:**\n\n* Put the remaining ~$60k into investment vehicles like a roth/index fund. This is where I could use some direction. I was thinking to open a Vanguard Roth IRA since I'm below the income limitation, which would of course only be $6,000 of my funds. Where should I put the other ~$54k? I like the idea of a set-it-and-forget-it method. \n\nI appreciate whoever decides to provide input - thank you!",
