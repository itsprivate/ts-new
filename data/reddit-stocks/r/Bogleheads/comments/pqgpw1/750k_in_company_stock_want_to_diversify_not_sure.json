Then it would sit in an index fund or other stocks, appreciate over time, and I would have to pay on the gains *again* when I sold the first time. \n\nSo I’m trying to make sense of this and figure out the best way to move forward here. It seems like if I were to diversify, I’d basically be paying capital gains twice on the same money for no reason.",
