And I've learnt quite a bit about how susceptible I can be to articulate and confident people on TV.\n\nFirst I listened to [Josh Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qgudp_jeTc&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) discussing how FB's rebranding of itself to Meta was a terrible decision and how that contributed to the company's downfall. He was super well spoken, gave convincing examples (like how Google didn't rebrand itself Waymo just cause) and was super persuasive about the bear case. If I didn't know about this sub, I'd have thrown my money into FB puts by the end of that clip.\n\nThen I listened to [Kevin O'Leary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6LLj1DYHos&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) go on about how Meta has missed earnings goals only thrice in the last decade and about how high the standards are for the company because of its dominance in the market. He also spoke passionately about how often he uses FB marketing for his small businesses and how ubiquitous Meta is in so many indexes. The man's arguments seemed beyond reproach and just as convincing as Brown from earlier. If I hadn't watched the previous video, I'd be into FB calls by now, thanking my lucky stars about the dip.\n\nBut before I'd do that, this clip of [Jim Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_cEwQkilCE&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) catches my eye. The man says the markets are going bipolar and nothing is predictable right now so the best thing to do is take cash out of the market and wait it out. He's super driven with his sleeves rolled up, no coat and looks like the well-meaning neighbor I've been living next to for decades. Surely he can't be wrong?\n\nAnd this is just for FB. We have similar talking points for AMZN, SNAP, NFLX and many many others. Everyone sounds right, everyone seems genuine, everyone is passionate and convinced they're right. But everyone can't be right, so who's the right one? \n\nAs I was going through these videos, I found myself imagining how I'd be investing if not for this sub. I'd be in and out of every stock that I'd hear about on a given day, confused and disoriented from the onslaught of opinions everywhere. Thank God for VTI.\n\nBogle was right when he said \"Investing is simple, but not easy.\"",
