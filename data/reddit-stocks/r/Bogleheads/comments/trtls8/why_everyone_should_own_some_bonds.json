Why would I own bonds, if my 100% stock portfolio has higher expected return?\"*\n\nCliff Asness (director of quantitative research at Goldman) provides a great answer in his **[1996 paper in the Journal of Portfolio Management, \"Why Not 100% Equities\"](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Journal-Articles/JPM-Why-Not-100-Equities.pdf?sc_lang=en)**. I encourage you to read the whole thing, it's only 5 pages.\n\n-----\n\nHere's a summary of quotes and main points - but for real, just read the paper:\n\n* \"Perhaps the most important lesson of modern finance is that under certain assumptions, the choices of 1) which risky assets to hold, and 2) how much risk to bear are independent choices.\"\n\n    * Step 1: \"Construct a set of efficient portfolios (portfolios with the most expected return for a given amount of risk).\"\n\n    * Step 2: \"Choose which of these efficient portfolios to hold.\"\n\n* The best risk-adjusted returns are obtained by diversifying not only across the stock market, but also across asset classes. \"Bonds and stocks are both part of an efficient portfolio.\"\n\n* A 60/40 stock-bond portfolio with modest leverage has higher returns than a 100% stock portfolio, with equal volatility:\n\n  | Portfolio             | Compound Return | Standard Deviation |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| 100% Stocks           | 10.3%           | 20.0%              |\n| 100% Bonds            | 5.6%            | 6.8%               |\n| 60% Stocks, 40% Bonds | 8.9%            | 12.9%              |\n| Levered 60/40         | 11.1%           | 20.0%              |\n\n    * Over a 40-year investment horizon, the 0.8% difference in return between the \"100% Stocks\" and \"Levered 60/40\" portfolios compounds up to around 40%, with the same amount of volatility.\n\n* \"Although the 100% stock portfolio has outperformed the 60/40 portfolio, it is not necessarily the portfolio that does so with the least risk.\"\n\n* Even ignoring leverage, \"it is only under very special circumstances that 100% stocks is the optimal portfolio.\"\n\n-----\n\nThe author also makes some points about leverage:\n\n* A 60/40 portfolio with a modest amount of leverage can has historically had drawdowns (\"worst cases\") that are comparable to those of a 100% stock portfolio.\n\n* Some investors feel like using any amount of leverage in investing is \"inviting disaster\", but this is often not a carefully-considered belief. (In reality, most investors are *already* investing with leverage - any investor with a mortgage is leveraged.)\n\n* Most people can access leverage at near the risk-free rate, if not directly, then by options on indices. (A modern alternative would be to invest in mutual funds / ETFs run by institutional investors following your preferred strategy, such as [NTSX](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/capital-efficient/ntsx) (roughly, 1.5x 60/40) or [PSLDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst) (roughly, 2x 50/50).)\n\n    * Interestingly: in 2019, [Vanguard removed the ability to trade leveraged ETFs through their platform](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/leveraged-inverse-etf-etn), but they made a sole exception for NTSX, which is still tradeable on their platform to this day.\n\ntl;dr: If you're invested in 100% stocks, you're giving up around 0.8% per year of return due to lack of diversification across asset classes.",
