That’s what the account was for, so we’re psyched that this is happening. (We live in Seattle, so it’s a bit insane that we managed to pull this off)\n\nThis is a “starter home,” and we’re hoping to move up onto something bigger in about 4-5 years. Sure, we’ll use the (*knock wood*) profits from the sale of this place to get into the second, but it’ll help to have also have a big chunk of change to cover down payment, closing costs, earnest money, etc. \n\nGiven that, I’m trying to figure out the best way to replenish our newly-depleted Vanguard account on a 4-5 year horizon. Let’s assume ~$3k initial balance; ~$900/mo inputs. Ideally, I’d like to hit ~$70-75k at around year five. \n\nGiven the abridged timeframe, I’m considering going somewhat conservative on this. I’m trying to decide between\n\n—VWELX (Wellington)\n—VWINX (Wellesley)\n—VSCGX (the “life strategy conservative growth” fund)\n—...or even VTINX (the post-retirement income fund). \n\nI know expense ratios are different, but it’s a small pot of money on a short time scale, so the absolute difference in expenses won’t be substantial.\n\nI’m also mulling over the idea of keeping about 10% of the portfolio in small cap (Maybe a 60:40 mix of SPSM and FNDC). In general: yay small caps (~40% of my Roth is AVUV), but again: short time frame...\n\nAdvice and ruminations are always welcome! Thanks in advance!",
