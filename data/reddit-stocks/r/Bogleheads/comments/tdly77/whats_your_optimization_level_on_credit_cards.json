I could see some saying 1 card is all they need (a 2.5% cashback card with no fees for example). However, by simply adding a second card, one could see an additional 1-2% savings. Assuming $25k of annual spend, that’s $250-$500 per year just for adding a second card to their wallet and remembering to use it when appropriate (for example, at restaurants). \n\nWhere do folks draw the line at simplicity vs at least a little optimization? Surely $500 per year in savings on an expense ratio would probably be enough to have it’s own thread here… what about on credit card optimization?",
