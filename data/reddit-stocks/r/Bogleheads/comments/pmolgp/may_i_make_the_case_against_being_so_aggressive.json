While no one can predict future returns, there are a lot of warnings and indicators of a correction at best and a crash at worst coming.  Just out of curiosity I decided to pit some aggressive portfolios against some more conservative portfolios.  Using Large Cap US stocks and intermediate bonds I compared a 50/50 stock bond portfolio, and 70/30, and a 100% stock portfolio starting in 1998 in the lead up before the .com bust all the way to today, this would include the 2008 mortgage backed security crash.  This assumed an initial investment of $200k which is about what I currently have invested, and monthly contributions of $1800, which is about what I contribute.\n\nObviously the 100% portfolio won with a grand total of $3,503,724.  The 70/30 came second with  $2,903,010.  And the 50/50 came last with $2,463,286.  No surprises there, what I did find surprising is that the 100% stock portfolio was neck and neck with both the 70/30 and the 50/50 until the beginning of 2017.  Only in the last 4.5 years did 100% stocks begin to overtake a portfolio that was 54% less risky.  Standard deviation for the 50/50 portfolio was 7.27% while the 100% stock allocation was 15.27%.  Even more interesting for me was that during the Covid crash of 2020 the 50/50 and the 70/30 portfolio turned down only slightly, while the 100% portfolio took a nose dive to the point that it was once again even with the other two conservative portfolios.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is, I know the standard logic is to pick an asset allocation and stick with it, and to take on more risk when young and only begin to taper off risk when approaching retirement age.  But looking at this data I see a strong case to be made, certainly not to exit the market entirely, but to become more defensive when troubled waters seem imminent.  The losses incurred by becoming more defensive and being wrong seem minimal.  I don't believe this is the same trying to time the market, I see no problem with taking profits off the table and being slightly more cautious when red flags start popping up.  Your thoughts?",
