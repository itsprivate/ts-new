The more I save, the quicker I can reach financial independence. In my 20’s I’ve stayed in 100% stocks and have not purchased any bonds. I have a pretty tough skin and risk tolerance and didn’t even consider selling during the short 2020 market crash.\n\nHowever, I also understand the importance of an emergency fund. I started with around $10,000 in an Ally savings account and have increased it up to $25,000 over the past few years.\n\nMore recently, I’ve considered putting most of my emergency fund into I-bonds. I understand they are less liquid than a savings account but in the long run will be less affected by inflation. Looking at historic rates, they almost always are at least 1-2% higher than a high yield savings account.  https://imgur.com/a/agSHRni\n\nThe pro to an online savings account is only liquidity and money available within a few days. \n\nFrom what I can tell about I-bonds the pros and cons are:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Higher Inflation Protected Interest Rates\n\nCons:\n\n1. Locked up for 1 year from time of purchase.\n\n2. Forfeit 3 months interest if redeemed within 5 years\n\n3. Limited to $10,000 purchased per year \n\n4. May take longer to redeem in an emergency \n\nI think I can deal with all of the cons in my current situation. If I purchase 10k this year and 10k towards the end of next year I could limit my exposure to liquidity issues. My plan would be to buy 10k this December, bring my emergency fund savings account back to 20k by next December, then buy 10k more. At that point I would have 20k in I-bonds and 10k in a savings account. Ideally for small emergencies I wouldn’t even have to touch the I-bonds. Even sacrificing 3 months of interest after 1 year I would still be ahead relative to a high yield savings account. 9 months at an I bond rate beats 12 months at current savings accounts rates.\n\nIn the short term, 15k liquidity is plenty. I have a local safety net and could both cover a 6-month lease liability ($3750) and the maximum out of pocket for health insurance ($6500). Worst case I could also move back in with parents and just pay for partial utilities and food. My current industry also has a pretty high demand so it wouldn’t be difficult to get another similar paying job.\n\nOne of my main concerns is how difficult it is in practice to redeem I-bonds. Could I put a large emergency expense on a credit card, cash in the same amount of electronic I-bonds the same day, and be able to pay off the credit card within 3 weeks?",
