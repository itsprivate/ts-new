It essentially starts by saying that statistically, lump sum beats DCA. We (mostly) all know that, although we all also know that there is a big mental barrier to going all-in at once.  So the article promotes the idea of going all-in, although splitting it between equity/bonds, with the math to back that this beats DCA, whichever the equity/bond split, as money out of the marketing is losing value and doing nothing for you.\n\nPersonally, I'd be happy to go 100% equity right now, although my wife is more conservative with that mental all-in barrier and I respect that. So I've followed the article's advice.\n\nI currently have 125.1K settled into my brokerage and went all in with a split between 20% equity (split based on VT weights of U.S. vs non-U.S.) &amp; 80% short-term bonds (split 50/50 between government &amp; investment grade corporate). I will do the same splits with the remaining 155K once those funds settle into my brokerage account for the total of about 280K. Then over the coming months I'll gradually move everything out of bonds &amp; into the equities.\n\nHere is the current $125,100 breakdown:\n\n* VTI $14,735\n* VXUS $10,285\n* BSV $75,060\n* VCSH $25,020",
