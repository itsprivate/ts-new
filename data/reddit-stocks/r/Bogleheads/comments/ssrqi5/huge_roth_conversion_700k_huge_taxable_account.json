Thanks to you people here, she realized she was wrong. So I'm converting all $700k of my Simple IRA and non-deductible IRA contributions from 2016 until now, this year. My tax bill from this conversion is going to be nearly $300k. But that isn't all....\n\nThanks to my good friends at Vanguard, I was one of the \"target date fund in a taxable account\" victims. I posted my feelings on that matter here previously. But at any rate, what that debacle did do was force me to do something that had been on my mind for a while...that while my 2035 target date fund's performance had been fantastic ($400k in distributions + $1.1M in capital gains over 6 years), it was going to produce lower and lower returns each year as it moved towards being merged into the Target Date Retirement Income fund with an annual expected return of 4-5%. I'm at a point where I do not need bonds in my portfolio due to the overall size of my portfolio. I can handle the volatility and a 50% drop for years, ect. I'll be fine. I knew if I wanted higher returns I was going to have to exchange my funds for something like VSTAX but I didn't have the guts to pull the trigger and realize the gains to make the exchange. Well Vanguard's prioritization of big clients over small clients solved that problem as they forced me to realize $550k of my gains in 2021, and I'm just going to go head and realize the other $550k here in 2022. \n\nSo my Roth conversion tax bill \\~$300k + taxable account mutual fund exchange tax bill \\~$150k = $450k ON TOP OF my regular tax bill, which will be around $500k. \n\nI'm looking at a $950k tax bill for April 2023, nearly half of which is to make these changes. Unreal. I can cashflow this. I'm OK to take the short term pain for the long term gain.\n\nMy original idea was to dollar cost average this change over 10 weeks, 1/10th at a time. I'm about 3 weeks into this.\n\nI realize as the market drops, my conversion tax bill goes lower. Yay! My original thinking was something like this:\n\nMarket drops 1% in a day, convert 5% of the starting total.\n\nMarket drops 2% in a day, convert 10% of the starting total.\n\nMarket drops 5% in a day, convert 50% of the starting total.\n\nMarket drops 10% in a day, convert 100% of the remaining assets...don't be greedy, don't look back.\n\nI also have an automatic exchange set for every Wednesday no matter what. (Roth has to be manual).\n\nSo, if you are still reading...thank you!....curious if you could share what kind of plan you would put in place to do this conversion to reduce the tax bill. I'm in uncharted territory. ðŸ˜¬",
