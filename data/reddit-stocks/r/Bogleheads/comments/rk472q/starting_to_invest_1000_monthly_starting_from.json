This will free up £1000 per month to invest (I have an emergency fund), and I will continue to save some cash each month to pay for emergency car repairs or home improvements.\n\nI'm interested in those who may have done this before to share some advice with me. I've read 'Own the World' and would like to ensure I'm diversified in assets. I'm mid way through 'Gone Fishing Portfolio' however the investments Alex Green recommends require a £3k min investment and I'm not there yet.\n\nI'm 32, married and have one child. I have budgeted that I will be able to absorb the cost of a second child by reducing costs in other areas. Therefore, assuming no disasters, I will invest this amount monthly until I retire, which is when I reach £500k invested, where I will take no more than £20k a year and likely pick up some part time work to cushion any market volatility.\n\nOn top of this money, I will max out my employer contribution in to my pension. I'm wary of going above this as I don't feel comfortable not having control of when I can access this. I'm a basic rate taxpayer and will likely stay that way for the next c.5 years.\n\nI'm essentially asking for advice on how to boggle with less than £30k\n\nThank you for any advice you can offer. If I've missed anything please let me know.",
