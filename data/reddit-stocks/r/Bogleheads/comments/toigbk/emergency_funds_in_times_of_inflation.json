I was so grateful I had saved this money when the pandemic hit in 2020 and my job was uncertain (thankfully, I didn't lose my job). Ultimately, I really believe in emergency funds and the comfort they can give.\n\nThat being said, I've always just held mine in a cash savings account and haven't given much thought to it. All the talk about inflation has me wondering if perhaps I should be looking at this money differently. Is there somewhere else I could put some or all of that money so that it suffers less from inflation, but still serves the purpose of being accessible for an emergency?\n\nPlease note - I'm a US expat living in Aus, so not all investment options and tax treatments are the same. Nonetheless, the principle behind the ideas is the most important thing, and I can always research equivalent options here.",
