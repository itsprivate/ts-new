For example she spent over a month researching which car to buy, and caught the car salesmen twice trying to sneak higher prices past her during negotiation. She is the perfect person I would expect to be a boglehead.\n\nShe is currently sitting on $60k in cold hard cash, that she has been building up for over 3 years. I knew she must have some but I didn't know it was this much. I introduced her to the bogleheads philosophy, sent her a link to The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, sent her a link to the bogleheads forum.\n\nThat was about 6 months ago. I have tried to engage her since then, but she just does not seem interested in the topic. Which is even more infuriating because that's exactly the type of person who should be investing in low cost index funds. Someone who literally doesn't care and will only check it every 5 years or so. She said she is too scared to invest, too risk adverse. I tried to tell her (and her sisters) that in fact the riskier thing by far is to not invest. But I don't seem to be getting through to them.\n\nShe is still kind of young, so I think she thinks she still has time, but my analytical brain is on fire thinking of the compounding interest she is losing out on.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue? How do I convince her what she is doing, while it may feel safe, is actually way more dangerous?\n\nedit: I should clarify that I am NOT trying to force Bogleheads philosophy on my sister-in-law. I'm not even really a Boglehead myself, although I do admire and desire to be a Boglehead. I have had maybe 3 conversations with her about investing, each less than 5 minutes long. This post is about my anxiety and concern for my family's financial health.\n\nMy mother became very ill when I was 20 years old, and was forced into early retirement. She didn't have enough saved up by then to survive on her own. It has been very tough for me to witness, and I think my fears are coming out in anxiety when I see other people I love make decisions that might set them up for a similar fate.",
