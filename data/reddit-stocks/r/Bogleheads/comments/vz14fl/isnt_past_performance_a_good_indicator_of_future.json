Isn’t the entire mathematical field of statistics based on the idea that past results can be used to make a good guess at future results? \n\nIt also seems that over the last 50 years even when international has done better the US has still done well. In comparison there have been decades (2010s specifically) where the US has massively outperformed while international has been flat. \n\nWhats the argument for including international stocks other than slightly greater diversification when your return has been diminished by investing in international over the last 30 years?",
