My wife is 31 and is 100% hands off, I'm 34 and learning the ropes regarding retirement accounts.\n\nFor my wife's account, I put 100% into VT since I believe it covers both US and international. For my account, I have 70% in VTI and 30% in VXUS. \n\nI've heard mixed reviews on when to include bonds, so I'm planning on holding off until the age of 40. At that time I'll move to the traditional 3-fund portfolio.\n\nIf it matters, wife has county job with a pension, I have 401k that is 100% invested in a target date fund.\n\nAny thoughts on our current portfolios would be appreciated. Specifically, if 100% in VT is a good idea and if I should be including bonds in the portfolios at our age. Thanks!",
