Assets are now on sale.\n\nAnd then kept pressing the button to generate more text.\n\nIt generated this glorious screed hawking a beat the market get rich quick book.\n\nEverything below the first line is 100% generated by InferKit, in order about 200 words at a time, by me simply pushing the button.\n\n> The market always goes up. Assets are now on sale.\n> \n> I have to ask: What price can you sell assets at? The answer: Anything.\n> \n> Profits are up, but have been rising for the past four quarters, averaging 13%, and higher than the S&P 500's average profit, 5%.\n> \n> Note: I'm expecting the price of the S&P 500 to rise, but not at the rate of 1% per quarter.\n> \n> Even if profits only rise 2% a quarter, the S&P 500 should still beat the 10-year Treasury, 6%, with current earnings, meaning buying it is a good deal for the long run.\n> \n> Also note: The market is reflecting the highest profit margins in three years.\n> \n> What's the downside to selling out your holdings?\n> \n> What if I told you that it would be perfectly reasonable to expect the S&P 500 to go up another 25% to 50%?\n> \n> Would you listen?\n> \n> Unfortunately, you may have missed your chance to capitalize on this sweet trade. That's because prices have already peaked.\n> \n> This is all in my good fortune-making book, and I'll explain in a moment, but first, here are the charts:\n> \n> The charts are bullish, but this is an unusual time.\n> \n> Remember, I usually come out with a contrarian read on the market. Usually, people think I'm being negative. Not this time.\n> \n> My contrarian read on the market is the same as my buy-and-hold: it's time to sell.\n> \n> I've always said this is a bubble, and it's a fact. For a lot of people, it's going to be hard to sell even when the selling's over.\n> \n> I often say the market's going to go up and come back down. That's because the market is a tremendous buyer of stocks. Most people don't know it, but you can't buy more stocks than the market will buy them.\n> \n> The reason is simple. If the market has $10 trillion in stocks, it will want them all.\n> \n> To put it another way: If a corner store has $1 billion in stocks, it'll only buy stock in the store. So why would it buy the $1 billion in the corner store? It can't, unless it's a real businessman.\n> \n> So how do you know when a market's going to pop?\n> \n> Simple. When the top 1% own 80% of the stocks.\n> \n> And right now, the top 1% owns 80% of stocks. It's their time to run.\n> \n> Remember, if you're in the 1%, when the stock market runs higher, that's your time to run.\n> \n> Let's say the market goes up 50%. Most people think that's crazy, but no. It's not. At that point, 80% of the stocks will go up 50%. And the top 1% will have to dump their stock.\n> \n> At that point, they're not missing out on profits, they're not out of the market. They're running for the exit. That's why I say the market is a bubble.\n> \n> How can this happen?\n> \n> First, the problem is too much debt. Over the past few years, the average household has been taking on $30,000 a year in credit card debt.\n> \n> If you're not debt-free, now's not the time to start.\n> \n> Second, the Fed is a big part of the problem. They're crazy. No matter what they say, they're going to keep pushing the dollar higher.\n> \n> But what if you can't get out now?\n> \n> What if you're already in the top 1%, and have no savings and are spending everything?\n> \n> That's okay. I know you'll find a way.\n> \n> But what if you can't find a way?\n> \n> Then consider my book.\n> \n> The book is like a guide to trading. There's no methodology. No charts. Just good common sense. And more importantly, plenty of actionable advice.\n> \n> I tell you what to buy and sell.\n> \n> I tell you which stocks to buy and sell.\n> \n> I tell you when to buy and when to sell.\n> \n> I tell you how to handle a bear market.\n> \n> But most importantly, I teach you how to time the market. The thing is, most people think they can time the market. They don't.\n> \n> They don't because they don't know how to time a real market.\n> \n> For example, if you tell me it's 10 AM and there's a bear market, I don't know what you mean. I'll ask, \"What time is the market in the morning?\"\n> \n> \"Ten minutes to 10 AM.\"\n> \n> \"So when is the market today?\"\n> \n> \"Now.\"\n> \n> You don't know. You don't know what time the market is.\n> \n> In the real world, if there's a bear market, there's no single day of time. But I'll tell you when to sell everything.\n> \n> You'll understand what I'm saying when you read the book.",
