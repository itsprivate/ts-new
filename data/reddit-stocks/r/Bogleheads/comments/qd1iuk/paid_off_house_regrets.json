This means my money will double 5 times which when I do the math after adding what is already invested comes out to a very large number. Although im putting a lot into invesments right now due to the increased cashflow, I feel like putting the 250-300k in the market now while im young would be huge for me later on in life\n\nObv i would have a mortgage but Im figuring if sh*t hits the fan i can always downsize or rent to make sure i dont touch my investments..\n\nI absolutely LOVE having a paid for house and living a debt free lifestyle. This is very tempting the more i think about it though…\nThoughts?",
