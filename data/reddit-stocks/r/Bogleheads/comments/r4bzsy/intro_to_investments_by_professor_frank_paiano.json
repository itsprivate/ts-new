  "selftext": "Intro into Investments by Professor Frank Paiano\n\n- Must know your time horizon for investments\n  - Short Term Investments – 1 year or less\n  - Intermediate Term Investments – 2-5 years\n  - Long Term Investments – 5 plus years\n- Is the investment Liquid(stocks) or Illiquid (Real Estate)?\n- Don&#39;t buy preferred shares or convertible shares of stock. They have tax advantages that individual investors can&#39;t get\n- Derivative assets(futures) - derive their value from an underlying security or something else (very speculative)\n- Stocks – you are the owner\n- Bonds – you are the bank\n- Short term securities – cash = principal is safe. Inflation risk still exists.\n- Mutual Funds – managed on your behalf\n- Stocks have historically done better than bonds but move up and down more (Do you want to eat well or do you want to sleep well?)\n  - Stocks have a greater distribution range than bonds. IE – they up 30% one year and down 10% the next\n  - Investment returns over time tend to mirror a normal distribution or &quot;bell curve&quot;\n  - The greater the standard deviation, the wider the distribution of returns and the risker the investment. Stocks have wider distribution and more risk than bonds. But long term they provide a higher average return\n- Don&#39;t chase the next big thing. You will lose\n- Don&#39;t speculate\n- Do NOT invest in an annuity\n- Short Term Investments - Cash\n  - 1 year or less\n  - Usually Guaranteed\n  - Very liquid\n  - Low Risk-Low Return\n  - Good place for emergency fund\n  - Can lose purchasing power if they don&#39;t keep up with inflation. Which they sometimes don&#39;t\n    - Common types\n  - Savings accounts – stated rate of interest\n  - Series EE savings bonds - Discount method – buy for $50 and redeem for $100 later.\n  - Series I savings bonds – indexed to inflation\n  - Treasury Bills – 1, 3 or 6-month maturity\n  - Certificate of Deposit (CD) – have to be on deposit for a certain amount of time. From days to years. They usually rollover if you don&#39;t stop them\n  - Money Market Mutual Fund – mutual fund that invests only in short term securities. Unlike savings, they are not federally guaranteed but are considered risk free because other companies will bail them out in a problem\n- Mutual Funds\n  - Choose a family, not a fund\n  - Professional money management and diversification\n  - DCA – Dollar cost average is a great way to invest in mutual funds. You don&#39;t worry what the market is doing or where it is going.\n  - Don&#39;t try to time the market. DCA!!!\n  - Keep a long-term horizon and DCA\n  - Most mutual fund investors BUY HIGH and SELL LOW. Don&#39;t do this. Do not bail out of stocks when the market is down and buy on the way up. Most mutual fund investors do worse than the funds they invest in.\n  - Choose a fund family and stick with them. Re-evaluate your investments once a year.\n  - PITA (Pain in the A\\*\\*) factor is low\n  - Fees\n    - Management fee - Between 0.05% and 2% based on asset value\n    - 12b-1 – &quot;Advertisement fee&quot; usually under 1%\n    - Trading Cost – not disclosed in the prospectus. Look at the fund turnover. Higher turnover = higher trading costs. Lower turnover = lower trading costs\n    - Load – charge a commission when the fund is bought. Paid to the financial representative. Usually 3-5%\n      - A – front end load – paid upfront\n      - B – back end load – paid when shares are sold\n      - Deferred sales charge – ladder down then go to zero. 5,4,3,2,1\n    - No Load – no commission when the fund is bought\n      - No sales representative\n      - 12b-1 Fee can&#39;t be over 0.25%\n      - I, F = don&#39;t have a &quot;load&quot; but charge a &quot;management fee&quot; of usually 1-2%\n      - Index funds are usually true no load funds – be careful because some 401K&#39;s have index funds with very high fee\n\n- REIT – Real Estate Investment Trust\n  - Pass through investments that must distribute 95% of earnings to shareholders\n  - Own various forms of real estate\n  - Good long-term investment\n  - No PITA factor unlike being a landlord\n  - Very liquid\n  - They are a hedge against inflation\n  - No management concerns\n  - Offer diversification\n- Stocks\n  - Allow general public ownership in a business\n  - Historically the best return is in stocks\n  - Very liquid\n  - Primary Market – IPO&#39;s – don&#39;t get involved in this\n  - Secondary Market – where most investors trade\n  - Stay away from OTC (Over the Counter) markets\n  - Bid (Sell) - Ask (Buy) – what they will buy or sell a security for. The market makers make the spread between the bid/ask and provide liquidity to the market\n  - Don&#39;t buy on margin\n  - Don&#39;t sell short\n  - Dow Jones – price weighted index of 30 companies\n  - S+P 500 – market cap weighted index of 500 companies\n  - MSCI and EAFE – index of foreign companies\n  - Stock spin off – conversion of a company&#39;s subsidiaries into a standalone company\n  - Stock split – increase in number of shares outstanding. IE 2 for 1. You had 100 shares at $10 but now you have 200 shares at $5\n  - Share buyback – company buys back their own shares and this increases the EPS because you have less shares\n  - Stocks can have different classes.\n    - A – original shares\n    - B, C, D, E, etc – companies can have different share classes that have different rights or benefits. IE – higher dividend, more votes, etc. look at what you are buying\n  - You want cash dividends, not stock dividends\n\nValuation techniques\n\n- Fundamental analysis of finance holds that the value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows\n- The worth of a company is primarily based on the earnings the company will produce in the future (difficult to predict)\n- The most fundamental influence on stock prices is the level and duration of the future growth earnings and dividends. However, future earnings are dividends are NOT easily estimated even by professionals – Burton Malkiel\n- There is no single financial ratio(P/E) that can summarize the general state of affairs of the company\n- P/E ratio – current price of a company divided by the earnings per share. Industries tend to have certain P/E ratios. Some tend to have higher or lower P/E\n- Historically P/E was supposed to match its growth rate. IE – 20% growth rate = 20 P/E. But P/E have been 100+ at times\n- Growth stocks tend to have high P/E – must have very high earnings to justify\n- Value stocks tend to have low P/E – doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it is a good buy\n- The P/E ratio tells you how long to earn back your investment back. IE – P/E 10 takes 10 years\n- Price/Sales ratio (P/S) – same as P/E but you used sales instead of earnings. Usually used for fast growing companies who don&#39;t have any earnings. Wall St. justified high prices on internet stocks during the late 90&#39;s by using a P/S ratio\n- Price/Book Ratio (P/B) – Book value is assets minus liabilities. P/B ratio is current price divided by book value.\n- Price Ratio Analysis - Expected stock price =\n  - 5-year average P/E or P/S or P/Cash Flow x Current EPS X (1 + EPS Growth Estimate)\n  - The Price Ratio Analysis has not been very reliable analysis tool\n- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)\n  - Shares of a stock are valued on the basis of the present value of the future dividend streams the stock is projected to produce\n  - This strategy worked very well during the 2001 downturn\n  - Value of a stock = present value of all future dividend payments\n  - Present value – the value today of a lump sum to be received at some future date\n  - Different types of DDM\n    - Zero Growth – assumes dividends will continue at a fixed rate indefinitely. Works well for stable income producing stocks\n      - Take annual dividends and divide by required rate of return (you generate this number)\n      - IE – Dividend of $3 a share and 6% required rate of return = $50 share value\n      - Zero growth is another way to think about dividend yield\n      - IE – Dividend divided by market price = rate of return\n      - Example – Utility stock pays a $2.86 dividend. Current price is $75. If we want an 8% return take 2.86/0.08 = $35.75 – stock is overvalued based on our expected 8% return\n      - You can also flip the formula to get what the market thinks the return is going to be. Take the dividend/price. 2.86/75 = 3.81%\n    - Constant perpetual growth model – assumes dividends will grow at a specified rate perpetuity into the future. Good for companies with consistent dividend growth\n      - Example – dividend of $10 per share and a 5% dividend growth rate. Required rate of return = 15%.\n      - (10 x 1.05) / (15% - 5%) = 10.5 / 10% (0.1) = $105\n      - 3M example - $230.37 per share. $5.44 dividend. Dividend growth 8%. Required rate of return 13%\n      - (5.44 x 1.08) / (13 – 8) = 5.87 / 5% = $117.50 – overvalued based on example. But this formula is very susceptible to changes in required rate of return\n    - The constant perpetual growth model is very sensitive to dividend growth and required return rates plugged into the formula\n    - You can&#39;t use DDM for a company that isn&#39;t paying dividends\n    - Dividend growth rates are very difficult to estimate. Unless you are looking at large cap, well established companies. But for smaller, faster growing companies in new industries, it is almost impossible\n    - DDM – The value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows\n    - This strategy is good for prudent, long term investors\n- The value line investment survey is a good place to get your information. You can get this information at some library&#39;s.\n- Doing all this math only tilts the odds in our favor. It doesn&#39;t guarantee that it will work like we wanted. Ask yourself a simple question. Would I want to own this company if I had X dollars? That is the real question.\n- There is no one financial ratio that tells you to buy or sell a stock\n- Balance Sheet\n  - Financial summary of firm&#39;s assets, liabilities, and shareholders&#39; equity\n  - Assets – liabilities = shareholder equity\n  - Current – Less than 1 year\n  - Long Term – More than 1 year\n- Income Statement\n  - Financial summary of the operating results for a specified period\n  - Revenue – expenses = income\n- Cash Flow Statement\n  - Financial summary of the cash flow of the company and other events\n- Reports\n  - 10K – annual\n  - 10Q – quarterly\n- Financial Ratios – remember there is no one ratio to consider\n  - P/E – Price/Earnings\n    - Most popular stock market ratio\n    - Price/EPS\n    - Tells you how long in years it will take the company to earn back its price. P/E of 5 = 5 years to earn back your investment\n    - Look at competitor&#39;s P/E ratio. Don&#39;t just look at one number\n    - The P/E ratio should approximately match the growth rate. PEG ratio of 1. Higher than 1 = P/E is higher than growth rate. Less than 1 = P/E is lower than growth rate. More than 1 is common now.\n  - Dividend per share\n    - Dividend/Number of shares outstanding\n  - Dividend Yield\n    - Dividend per share/market price\n  - Dividend payout ratio – how much of the earnings are being paid out in dividends\n    - Dividend per share/EPS\n  - Book Value\n    - Shareholders equity/Number of shares outstanding\n    - It tells you the &quot;liquid&quot; value of the company if you sold off all the assets and paid off all the debts and paid off the shareholders. Many companies trade above book value because they are worth more intact than split up\n  - Price to book value per share – tells an investor how far above the market value is above the book value\n    - market price/book value\n    - 3-4+ is not uncommon. IE – Book value of $5 and market value of $20\n    - Less than 1 is bad because the company is in danger because raiders might try to take the company and sell off the assets\n  - Price to cash flow and price to sales – don&#39;t use these\n    - A way to &quot;value&quot; companies without earnings. Many companies were valued with this during the internet boom of the late 90&#39;s\n- Profitability ratio\n  - Net Profit Margin\n    - Rate of profit earned after expenses and taxes.\n    - Varies based on industry\n    - Net Income/Total Revenue\n  - Gross Profit Margin\n    - Rate of profit earned from gross profit\n    - Gross Profit/Total Revenue\n  - Operating Margin\n    - Rate of profit being earned from net income adjusting for non-cash items\n    - Operating Income/Total Revenue\n    - The higher the better with the profitability ratios. But check your competitors and see what is the normal for your industry\n  - Return on assets (ROA)\n    - Measures profitability relative to its total assets\n    - Net Income/Total Assets\n  - Return on equity (ROE)\n    - Measure of the overall profitability of a company in relation to shareholders equity\n    - Net Income/Total Stockholder equity\n    - Return on equity is sensitive to the amount of debt a company carries. If a company carries more debt, it will have a higher ROE.\n    - ROA and ROE can be drastically different, especially if a company carries lots of debt\n- Liquidly Ratios\n  - Current Ratio\n    - Current Assets/Current Liabilities\n    - Current ratio of 1.0 or higher is good. It means you have enough money to fund your short-term obligations. Higher number is better\n- Leverage Ratios\n  - Debt to equity ratio\n    - Long-term debt/Total stockholder equity\n    - A higher ratio means that the company is financing its growth with debt. The lower the number the better\n- Sir Issac Newton – I can calculate the movement of the stars but not the madness of men\n- Maynard Keynes – The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\n- From 1963-1998 the S+P 500 Index funds beat the active funds in 22 of the 36 years\n- Many mutual funds have high expenses and high turnover rates. They also have a short time horizon. This makes it hard for them to beat the market.\n- If you hear – BE CAREFUL!!!\n  - It&#39;s a new era\n  - It&#39;s different this time\n  - The old ways of valuing stocks are gone\n- Ben Graham – the investing public is incorrigible. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some action in progress.\n- Mania&#39;s will end with a crash every time.\n- Ben Graham – Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy\n- John Templeton – Bear markets are born of pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy.\n- Diversification – spreading your investments across asset classes to eliminate some, but not all risk\n- Diversification – guarantees that some investments will not do well any given year. You have to look at the whole portfolio\n- Cash has not been the top performer vs stocks or bonds in the last 25 years.",
