  "selftext": "Over the past full year, as well as YTD, safe bonds have beaten stocks overall. I see some folks saying 'but they're supposed to be stable, and not crash like stocks!' Well, they *are* relatively stable, and they *aren't* crashing 'like stocks' -- equities can tank by 50%+ in a bad downturn, and we've seen crashes in that range a few times in the last 20 years. Typical intermediate-duration bonds almost never go down more than 5% over the course of a year (yes, longer-duration bonds can go down more, and should only be used if you have a long investment horizon).\n\nBut the most salient point is: when stocks go down, it generally means equities are 'cheaper' but it's hard to be sure where they'll go next (market can remain irrational) -- whereas with (safe) bonds (Treasuries and TIPS), if rising rates push down fund NAV, that means you'll get higher rates going forward. This relationship is much more straightforward -- NAV goes down, yields go up, you profit more in the years ahead. To make this as clear as possible: bond NAV going down is a *good thing for you* if you have a holding period longer than the duration of your bonds.\n\nMuch like the stock market, younger investors *in particular* should, if anything, *celebrate* funds getting cheaper, which means you can buy in cheaper and ultimately make more money. The mechanics of 'why' are slightly different for each asset class, but broadly: buying 'on sale' is better than *not* buying on sale.\n\nSo why am I posting this thread? I've seen a lot of people get disillusioned with recent bond performance, and even suggest finding 'other' safe assets to replace bonds. Sorry, but bonds are the best diversifiers out there for stocks. You should (as always) hold a healthy amount of both of these core asset classes to maximize risk-adjusted returns. My own preference is for 'ultra safe' bond types like Series I and EE, Treasuries, and TIPS.\n\n**I recently added a new link to the sidebar, and would highly recommend reading it if you're at all stressed about bonds: https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=360575**",
