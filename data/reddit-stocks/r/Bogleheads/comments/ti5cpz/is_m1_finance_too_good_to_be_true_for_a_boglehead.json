I am with Schwab today and have been for a solid decade or so. \n\n- I love the idea of automating a \"pie\" of nothing but VT. Transfer in $50, $500, it doesn't matter - the next day it will execute and buy a fractional amount of VT. That's beautiful compared to Schwab, where I must execute the trade myself. I'll admit I've let emotion play into it where I try to 'time' my purchase, and that's dumb. \n\n- With M1+ &amp; their checking account, my normal cash buffer would actually generate money despite the cost. Schwab's 0.03% in their checking account is meaningless. \n\n- The credit card sounds awesome. Automatically deposit my rewards into my VT \"pie\" and let it buy fractional shares and keep growing. From what I understand, you can simply toss $100 into a pie that has all of their partner companies and never touch it again. If nothing else, 2.5% at Costco &amp; 1.5% everywhere else isn't too bad. \n\n- The checking account lacks mobile check deposit (in 2022, wtf), and that holds me back from trying it a little bit. Hopefully this is on their roadmap. It matters for me like 2-3 times a year tops where I might get a bonus check and my company thinks it's cool to print it rather than direct deposit, but still, such an odd feature to be missing. \n\nIs M1 too good to be true? Are they even worth trying over a behemoth like Schwab?",
