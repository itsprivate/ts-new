One of the issues I brought up was all the capital gains taxes I pay yearly because they decide to sell a stock when they believe it is overvalued.  I told them that with VTI / VTSAX I would not have the capital gains because I would only sell when I need to use the money.  He said VTI / VTSAX has not had capital gains taxes implications because it has always been able to offset outflows with new inflows of capital as it has been continuously growing.  But, he warned, if VTI / VTSAX ever starts seeing more outflows than inflows than it would not be able to offset its capital gains and then I would feel that.  Does this have any merit?  I can't seem to wrap my head around this \"warning\".  Thoughts?",
