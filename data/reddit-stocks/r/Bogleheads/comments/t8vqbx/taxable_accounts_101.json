It's specific to US investors / tax laws, though some of the general themes might be broadly applicable to other locales.\n\nI hope it's useful to folks less familiar with investing in taxable accounts, as well as those with more experience who haven't gone down the rabbit-hole of tax-minimization techniques.\n\n## When to invest in a taxable account\n\nInvesting in a taxable account is the final step in the \"how to handle money\" [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) / [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png). Before that comes saving an emergency fund, paying down high-interest debt, and maxing your tax-advantaged savings options including:\n\n* Any employer retirement account or pension available to you - e.g. a [401(k)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/401(k)) or [403(b)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/403(b))\n   * [Mega-backdoor Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Mega-backdoor_Roth) contributions to your 401(k) or Roth IRA if supported by your employer's 401(k) plan\n* Your [HSA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Health_savings_account) if available\n* Your [IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/IRA) / [Roth IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Roth_IRA) (use [backdoor Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth) procedure if over the income limit for direct contributions)\n* If saving for future education expenses, a [529 plan](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/529_plan)\n\nNote: the order above isn't  precisely prioritized/prescriptive; the recommended prioritization if all account types are available is: employer plan contributions to max any match, then HSA, then IRA, then employer plan contributions up to limit, then 529.\n\nWhatever you do, don't be like the [roughly half of Robinhood users](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/brokerage-reviews/robinhood-review/) investing for the first time in a taxable account, using a brokerage that doesn't even support IRAs.\n\n## Taxation of taxable account investments\n\nIncome &amp; gains from investments in a taxable account are taxed as they are realized, with the tax rates depending on various attributes of the investment &amp; your income / filing status.\n\nIn general, you'll pay taxes on any:\n\n1. Dividends (treatment / rate dependent on on issuer &amp; holding period; effective rate dependent on any foreign tax credit)\n2. Realized capital gains on selling (treatment / rate dependent on holding period)\n3. Capital gains distributions from mutual funds (treatment / rate dependent on underlying holding period within fund)\n4. Interest (taxed as ordinary income unless exempt due to issuer -- e.g. Treasury bond interest is exempt from state/local income tax, while municipal bond interest is exempt from federal income tax, and often state/local income tax in state of issue)\n\nFor stock ETFs or Vanguard stock index mutual funds with an ETF share class, only (1) or (2) apply -- (3) shouldn't apply for those types of Vanguard mutual funds because they [siphon out](https://www.investopedia.com/how-vanguard-patented-a-system-to-avoid-taxes-in-mutual-funds-4686985) capital gains via their ETF share class in creation/redemption trades.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nYou'll be taxed at long-term capital gains rates on:\n\n* qualified dividends (dividends from a qualified issuer/holding held for at least 61 days)\n* capital gains on holdings sold after being held for more than a year\n* long-term capital gains distributed by a mutual fund\n\nYou'll be taxed at ordinary income rates on the remainder:\n\n* non-qualified dividends (non-qualified issuer or holding period)\n* short-term gains (sold when held for a year or less)\n* short-term capital gains distributed by a mutual fund\n* non-exempt bond interest\n\n**Rates**\n\nTax rates by income bracket &amp; filing status may be found [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Qualified_dividend#Tax_rates). Note that the income thresholds are effectively higher / shifted due to the [standard deduction](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/standard-deduction). The long-term capital gains rates are applied by considering the long-term gains income as being stacked on top of ordinary income (including short-term gains).\n\n## Minimizing taxes\n\nBelow is only a partial list of tax-minimization strategies with only a brief description of each; more-complete lists &amp; details may be found in the wiki under [Tax basics](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_basics#Taxable_accounts) and [Taxable account investing strategy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Taxable_account#Taxable_account_investing_strategy).\n\n* [Rebalancing with contributions](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Rebalancing#Different_rebalancing_approaches) \\- Try to rebalance to your target allocation using new money as much as possible to reduce tax implications around selling to rebalance. Turning off dividend reinvestment can help with this; direct dividends along with new money to funds below their target allocation.\n* [Tax-efficient fund placement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement) \\- E.g. try to keep non-municipal bond funds in a tax-advantaged account when possible, but ideally don't overweight them too much in a Roth account to avoid opportunity cost around higher tax-free compounded growth.\n* [Specific identification of shares](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Specific_identification_of_shares) \\- Ensure your brokerage account is configured so that when selling, you can select specific lots based on whether they individually have gains or losses, and their holding period.\n* [Tax-loss harvesting](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_loss_harvesting) \\- Have an itch to 'do something' when market prices drop? Consider tax-loss harvesting your recent lots, selling and immediately replacing them with roughly equivalent but not substantially identical funds (i.e. not the same fund, or another share class in the same fund like VTI/VTSAX, but another low-cost index fund tracking the same asset class). Note that this trades a tax break now for a higher tax burden in the future (because you lowered your cost basis). You need to be mindful of wash sale rules (avoid purchasing the sold security / a substantially identical fund within 30 days before or after the sale, in any account including tax-advantaged ones).\n* [Tax-gain harvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/s69z9i/psa_taxgain_harvesting_may_reduce_your_future_tax/) \\- Does your income this year &amp; filing status qualify you for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate? Take advantage of that by realizing gains while they're \"free\" (\\* caveats may apply).\n* Hold VTI + VXUS instead of VT (or VTSAX + VTIAX instead of VTWAX) in taxable -- 3 of the [benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sxtt66/explanation_on_difference/hxu32xg/?context=3) of doing that are specific to taxable accounts, including opportunity to &amp; ease of applying the 2 preceding strategies, and ability to reliably claim the foreign tax credit. Holding some VT lots in taxable with unrealized losses? Consider tax-loss harvesting those into VTI + VXUS.",
