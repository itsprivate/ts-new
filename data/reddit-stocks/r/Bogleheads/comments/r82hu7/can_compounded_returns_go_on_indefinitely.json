Its actual return will fluctuate daily, monthly, and yearly, but over the next 25, 50 or 75 years it will average around X%. Over the past century X has been somewhere between 7-8% (inflation adjusted).\n\nConsider the following thought experiment. I don't want to get too hung up on the specifics but I've tried to make it plausible.\n\nToday, an investor sets up a perpetual trust (aka a [dynasty trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_trust)) and funds it with $10,000,000. This is near the maximum you could put in without triggering a tax event. It's certainly a lot of money, but it is less than the net worth of the top 1% of US households. So there at least a million investors in the US that *could* do this, and tens of thousands that could do it *easily*.\n\nThe trust is invested 100% in a broad equity index. All the money is kept in for 250 years.\n\nThat's a very long time, but only 4 or 5 times the investment horizon of a young investor today.\n\nWhat will the trust be able to do with that money? Obviously it depends on the real return rate. \n\n* At just over 6% it could buy all the real estate in the US.\n* At 7% it would be able to buy all real estate on Earth.\n* At 8% it would be able to buy all real estate on Earth *every year without touching the principle.*\n\nEven at 5% it would pass \"buy the world\" levels of wealth in 365 years (Nevada's limit for perpetual trusts). \n\nThis doesn't seem right, and I don't mean from a wealth inequality standpoint. But it is the predicted outcome of continuous exponential growth. \n\nThoughts?",
