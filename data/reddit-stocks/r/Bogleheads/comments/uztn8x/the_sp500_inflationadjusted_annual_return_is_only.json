And after the first 13 years (January 2013), you would have still been in the red, not keeping up with inflation.\n\nI often see the sentiment, \"just invest in stocks, you'll get a 10% return (or 7% inflation-adjusted).\" While this is may be the historical long-term average for the SP500, it's important to realize that your investment could still be in the red even a decade later. Some young investors take it for granted that the market always bounces back quickly, but it's important to realize that you need a long time horizon. Instead of, \"buy the dip\", maybe they should say, \"buy the dip and wait 20 years.\"\n\nTo be fair, I've obviously cherry-picked bad timing. If you had been lucky to invest at the bottom, your returns would have beaten the average. It also helps if you had a steady income to continue investing incrementally over time, regardless of the level of the market.\n\nThe neat website below let's you run these simulations.\nhttps://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/\n\nBonus question: What inflation-adjusted return do you assume in your retirement projections?
