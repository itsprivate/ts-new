But we’ve got those covered.\n\n&gt; Looking at the first, the 500 largest stocks in the U.S. make up about 80% of VTSAX. The largest of these 500 are all international businesses, many of which generate 50% or more of their sales and profits overseas. Companies like Apple, GE, Microsoft, Exxon/Mobil, Berkshire Hathaway, Caterpillar, Coca-Cola and Ford to name a few. \n\n&gt; Since these companies provide solid access to the growth of world markets—while filtering out most of the additional risk—I don’t feel the need to invest further in international-specific funds. \n\n&gt; The second frequently cited reason is the expectation that the performance of international markets will not be correlated with that of the U.S. That is to say, when one is up the other might be down. The idea is having them as part of your asset allocation helps smooth the ride and offers the prospect of enhanced returns through reallocations. The problem is, as world economies become ever more closely knit together, this variation in the performance of their markets fades. While there will always be exceptions due to geopolitical events, world markets are becoming increasingly more correlated.\n\nHe goes on to recommend Vanguard mutual funds that cover international stocks if you still don't agree with his take, but I want to hear from other Bogleheads regarding their thoughts on how strong or weak this reasoning is.",
