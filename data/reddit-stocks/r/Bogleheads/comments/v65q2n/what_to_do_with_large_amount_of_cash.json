I make 93k a year before bonus money. I have the following in retirement accounts (total 140k):\n\nRoth IRA: 22k (I max this out)  \n401k: 58k (I try to max this out)  \nTraditional IRA: 60k\n\nI have 182k in cash in a savings account. I'd like to keep a little back for emergencies (10-25k). The way I see it, I have a few options:\n\n1. Lump sum or DCA the extra cash in a taxable brokerage to have another retirement vehicle that's more flexible.\n2. My employer offers an after tax savings that is automatically converted to Roth in the 401k (mega back door roth). I could max out my paycheck and put this in after tax and then use my savings to pay for expenses.\n3. Keep the cash and start putting more into the after tax mega backdoor Roth.\n\nI'd appreciate any suggestions as I feel lost on how to handle this.\n\nThanks,\n\ncash\\_hodlr",
