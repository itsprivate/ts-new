  "selftext": "Hi.  I'm 38.  My wife and I make respectable incomes but less than $100k each.  We used to make a lot more (more on that later), but we've scaled back to part-time consulting in order to spend more time with children.\n\nThis year alone, we are contributing $150,000 to 401k, IRA, HSA, and 529 (college savings).\n\nI set up this new Reddit account so that it can't be traced back to my real name, but everything I am sharing is legitimate and legal.  I simply don't want friends and family to know my financials.  I am the millionaire next door that you don't know about, and I prefer it that way!\n\n\\------\n\nWe are legally depositing $150,000 into tax-advantaged accounts this year:\n\n\\- $58,000 Mega Roth (me)  \n\\- $58,000 Mega Roth (wife)  \n\\- $6,000 Roth (me)  \n\\- $6,000 Roth (wife)  \n\\- $7,200 HSA (us)  \n\\- $15,000 529 (kids)\n\nRemember I said we used to make a lot more?  We have around $1.7mm in taxable accounts (not in retirement accounts), and I've been trying to figure out a way to load up 401k, IRA, and HSA as quickly as possible.  The less we have in taxable brokerage accounts, the better.  And the sooner we do it, the better our returns in the long run.\n\nThe trick?  Don't work for someone else.  Don't have a W2.  Instead, own your own business as a consultant and don't hire any employees.  My wife and I are both consultants running our own companies with no employees.\n\nWhen you own a company and collect business income, you can set up your own 401k plan for your business.  As an employee of that business, you can contribute the max to your own 401k, $19,500 each.  For this amount, I choose the Roth option.\n\nAs an \\*employer\\*, you can contribute another $38,500 after-tax to the 401k, and then transfer it into the Roth account.  That's $58,000 into Roth per person, per year.  It's called the Mega Roth.  Mega Roth may go away soon if the Build Back Better bill passes, but it's been around for years.\n\nThe reason you choose Roth (an after-tax contribution) is because Roth contributions do \\*not\\* decrease your taxable income.  The contributions are not tax-deductible.\n\nWhy would you ever want to maximize your taxable income?  Because of the QBI deduction.  A small business owner can now deduct 20% of their business net income.   The more income you have, the higher the deduction amount.  If you make $100,000 in a year, your business income is now just $80,000 according to the IRS (20% off).  You can then further subtract the standard deduction and any other deductions you may have, such as HSA contributions.  And because the contributions are in a Roth account, you won't be taxed on gains or withdrawals.\n\nThis doesn't prevent you from also contributing to a regular Roth ($6,000), HSA ($7,200 per family), or 529 college savings account (no limit unless you consider the gift tax per annum).\n\nThe idea behind this plan is relatively simple and applies to people with lots of cash but without significant retirement savings:  live off of your taxable brokerage accounts and contribute as many dollars of your income as you legally can into IRA, 401k, etc.  At this rate, we'll have $1.7mm (plus gains) in the tax-advantaged accounts, and a lot sooner than if we were working for someone else and capped at $19,500 per year in our 401k accounts.\n\nI know that we're incredibly fortunate and that this plan won't work for most people.  When I was 19, I was not contributing anything to retirement and I was mostly playing video games and drinking too much beer.  While we're now extremely well-off compared to most, we weren't maxing out 401k and IRA up until now.  That was a mistake.  We are playing catch-up with 401k and IRA.\n\nI hope this post inspires at least one person to think outside the W2 box and consider an interesting new direction.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask and I'll be glad to try to help out.  My background is in finance and data science.  My wife is in marketing.",
