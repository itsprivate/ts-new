I currently have about $3k in there for her and am getting ready to deposit another 1k from bday money. Should I switch it up and diversify maybe in VTSAX, or continue my trend?\n\nI am also putting away $300/month in another account, but wanting to focus on her vanguard for this question. Just know this is not “all eggs in one basket” situation. \n\nThanks!",
