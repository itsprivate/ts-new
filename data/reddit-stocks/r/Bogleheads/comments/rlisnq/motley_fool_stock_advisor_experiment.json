  "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI've been following Motley Fool on and off since 2000.  \n\nI've been doing relatively well in the market over the years, but I made a major mistake at the March 2020 Covid crash.  I sold nearly everything early in the crash because I also thought everything was overvalued, and I thought this was the big one.  It did save me from the depths of the plunge, but then I missed the recovery.  I kept expecting it to plunge back down, as I couldn't understand how all these losses would not kill the market, and it didn't.\n\nAnyway, long story short, by November 2020 I realized I had made a big mistake.  I joined StockAdvisor on Motley Fool at the time as well as Seeking Alpha and resolved to put a lot of effort and time into stock picking and buying and holding.\n\nAfter a few months though, I got sick of Motley fool continuously pushing insanely overpriced stocks, with the standard answer that valuation doesn't really matter for good companies.  That makes no sense to me.  So let's assume the price of TSLA's stock tomorrow jumped up to $10K.  Would it still not matter?  How about $100k?\n\nI did get a few good winners through Stock Advisor like CrowdStrike and Broadcom and Lam Research, but also quite a few duds like Lemonade.\n\nI stopped buying any of their stocks about 6 months in but always wondered if they're right.\n\nSo I've done this experiment.  Not sure if anyone will find it interesting, but might be helpful if anyone is curious\n\nStock Advisor recommends two stocks a month.\n\nIt will also release two lists of 5 Best Buys now during the month.  One for team Tom, and the other team David (teams renamed now but can't be bothered to check what they're called)\n\nSo I've created two Test Portfolios.\n\n1) StockAdvisor Recommendations:\n\nIn this one, I simulated putting $5000 in every stock recommended by StockAdvisor, at the closing price of the stock for the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) StockAdvisor Best Buys.\n\nIn this one simulated putting $1000 in each one of the best buys announced on the day it's announced.\n\nI've captured all recommendations from Nov 2020 till Nov 2021 when my subscription ran out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Results**\n\n1) Stock Advisor Recommendations Portfolio.\n\nAs of today, it is down 10.95%.\n\nIt holds 21 different stocks.\n\nThis is what it looks like for the year compared to S&amp;P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efgspyitbx681.png?width=2652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb1b6d78f3fd781928209da298df476adc16e5db\n\n2) Stock Advisor Best Buys Portfolio\n\nAs of today, it is down 12.91%\n\nIt holds 53 different stocks\n\nThis is what it looks like for the year compared to S&amp;P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynjz1xf5cx681.png?width=2651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=052da69c1e69ea3a282f6d1ac03388120ae21cab\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think this is a horrendous performance honestly.  I know the Fools will say, we're here for the long game etc, and in the short term the market will fluctuate, but I think this was pretty predictable given how overvalued and overhyped nearly all their recommendations are.\n\nYes they do come across some massive multi-baggers, but if you buy all they recommend equally, I don't think you'll beat market.  The numbers they share are since they started around 2000 , which is not a valid scenario for any of us.\n\nNeedless to say, I've become a boglehead. Sold a lot of my individual holdings and moved into index ETFs with a set allocation which I will rebalance twice yearly.\n\nKept a few of the big bets I had which I still believe in, but let's see how they do.\n\nHope this was interesting to someone.\n\n\\-Sam",
