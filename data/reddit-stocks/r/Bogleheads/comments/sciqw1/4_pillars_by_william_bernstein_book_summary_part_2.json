  "selftext": "4 Pillars by William Bernstein\n\nPillar 3 – Psychology\n\n-\tHumans are social creatures and enjoy associating with others. It is a good thing in general but a terrible one in investing\n-\tOverconfidence is probably the most important of financial behavior errors\n-\tThe illusion is that you can successfully pick stocks by following a few simple rules or subscribing to an advisory service. You are trading against hundreds of thousands of small and institutional investors who are also trying to beat the market. On top of that, there are tens of thousands of professionals using research and technology small investors can only dream of. When you buy or sell stock, you are probably trading with them.\n-\tYou also won&amp;#39;t be able to pick the right mutual fund or money manager. If the nation&amp;#39;s largest pension plans, managing billions of dollars, can&amp;#39;t pick successful money managers, what chance do you have?\n-\tThe immediate past is not predictive of the future\n-\tAsset classes have a tendency to revert to their mean over periods longer than 3 years\n-\tMean revision means that periods of relatively good performance tend to be followed by periods of relatively poor performance. The opposite is also true. But this is not a sure thing.\n-\t1993 Fuller study showed that popular growth stocks with high P/E ratios increased their earnings 10% faster than the market in year 1, 3% faster in year 2, 2% faster in year 3 and 4 and 1% in years 5 and 6. Eventually their high P/E ratios come down and with it their returns. In other words, you can expect a growth stock to increase its earnings, on average, about 20% more than the market over 6 years.\n-\tExample of above – and why you don&amp;#39;t invest in growth stocks\n  - Smokestack has a P/E of 20 and Glamour has a P/E of 80\n    - For every $100 of Smokestack stock it earns $5. 100/20 = 5\n    - For every $100 of Glamour stock it earns $1.25. 100/80 = 1.25\n    - If SS grows its earnings at 6% for 6 years it will increase earnings by 48% from $5 per share to $7.40 per share\n    - If Glamour grows is earnings 20% faster than the market over 6 years. It will increase earnings by 78%. 1.48 x 1.20 = 1.78. So, its earnings will grow from $1.25 to $2.23. After that it will have the same earnings growth as SS. The market will see the earnings slowing down and clobber its shareholders\n-\tThere are no patterns to the market. You can&amp;#39;t predict them. Just because the market behaved a certain way one time doesn&amp;#39;t mean it will repeat\n-\tIf history did repeat itself, the wealthiest investors would be librarians\n-\tThere are some pieces of data that have worth. Like housing starts or the length of the average industrial working week. The problem is that everyone knows this information too and it is already being factored into the stock and bond prices. Something that everyone knows isn&amp;#39;t worth knowing yourself.\n-\tPatterns can and do change\n-\tAn investment that has become the topic of widespread conversation is likely to\n\nbe overpriced. When everyone owns a particular asset class, many of those investors will be inexperienced &amp;quot;weak hands&amp;quot; who will panic and sell at the first sign of trouble\n\n  - Strategy for above\n    - Identify the era&amp;#39;s conventional wisdom and assume it is wrong\n      - At present that is that stock returns are higher than bonds-2010\n    - Asset classes with the highest future returns tend to be the ones that are currently the most unpopular. This means you will get disapproval from friends and neighbors who are buying what is popular\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t be overconfident. Do you really think you are smarter than those people on the other side of the trade? They are usually professionals with more resources than you can dream of.\n-\tTell yourself a couple times per year, &amp;quot;The market is smarter than I ever will be. There are millions of other investors who are much better equipped than me. If I can&amp;#39;t beat the markets, then the very best I can hope to do is join in as cheaply and efficiently as possible.&amp;quot;\n-\tIgnore the last 10 years and don&amp;#39;t buy the hot sector/market. In reality a better strategy is to buy what has done the worst the last 10 years. Markets tend to RTM (Revision to the mean)\n-\tThe most exciting tend to have the lowest returns\n-\tA superior portfolio strategy should be boring\n-\tMyopic risk aversions – humans tend to focus on short term losses and is detrimental to your portfolio\n  - Check your portfolio as infrequently as possible\n  - Hold enough cash so you have dry powder to take advantage of low prices.\n-\tThe intelligent investor tells himself each time he takes a hit, that low prices mean higher future returns\n-\tAll apparent stock market patterns are just coincidence. There are NO patterns. Ignore them\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t become a &amp;quot;whale&amp;quot;. You are the cash cow of the investment industry. Go boring no frills.\n-\tAvoid the herd\n-\tAvoid overconfidence\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t be impressed with an asset&amp;#39;s performance over the last 5 or 10 years\n-\tExciting investments are usually a bad deal\n-\tTry not to worry about short term losses\n-\tThe market tends to overvalue growth stocks. Good companies are not necessarily good stocks\n-\tBeware of forecasts\n-\tFocus on the whole portfolio\n\nPillar 4 – Business\n\n-\tYour broker is not your buddy\n-\tBrokers have no educational requirements, no fiduciary responsibility, interests that don&amp;#39;t align with yours, and you have to sign a form stating you will resolve all disputes via arbitration with the brokers own trade groups\n-\tBrokers need to churn your portfolio to make money\n-\tThey also make money on the spread\n-\tThe average broker is a salesman. Not a financial expert\n-\tYour broker&amp;#39;s stock picks come from the &amp;quot;squawk box&amp;quot; a loudspeaker that connects every branch to headquarters. The problem is that you are last in line and the price of the stock is already bid up by the time you get the recommendation\n-\tThe analysists that follow the stock also have pressure to push companies that their brokerage house does business with. They will never recommend placing a sell on a particular stock.\n-\tYou cannot trust your brokers recommendations\n-\tFor every 100% of turnover, investors lost 4%.\n-\tDo not have any relationship with a &amp;quot;full-service broker&amp;quot;\n-\tAvoid loaded mutual funds\n-\tAvoid variable annuities\n-\tPeople tend to invest in mutual funds that have done well in the past few years. Don&amp;#39;t do this\n-\tThe engine of retail brokerage and fund flows is the financial media\n-\tAll successful market timers are simply very fortunate coin flippers\n-\tDo not read any magazine, newspaper articles, or watch TV to get financial advice\n-\tNearly all of what you find in TV, newspapers, magazines and the internet is geared to the care and feeding of the retail investment business and journalists, who depend on each other\n-\tThere are very little new investment ideas coming out of academia. Most are already known\n\nPutting it all together – Assembling the 4 Pillars\n\n-\tIf you want to retire comfortably, you must save a lot\n-\tThe easiest way to get rich is to spend as little as possible\n-\tManage all of your assets as one portfolio so you can easily see what is going on\n-\tYou should plan on spending at a maximum, the expected real return of your portfolio each year. IE – 4% expected return = 4% withdraw\n-\tDuring the next 20 or 30 years, there will be a single, best allocation that in retrospect we will have wished we owned. The only problem is we don&amp;#39;t know which one that is. The safest idea therefore is to own as many asset classes as possible\n-\tKeep Large Value, All Small Caps, REIT&amp;#39;s out of your taxable accounts. They generate too much turnover or dividends and this triggers taxable events\n-\tAvoid large growth or small growth categories\n-\tAvoid Total International Fund in a taxable account\n-\tKeep bond maturity&amp;#39;s short in your portfolio. No long term bonds\n-\t5-year maturity is the best bang for your buck on bonds, you don&amp;#39;t get rewarded for extra risk past this year.\n-\tWhen the yield gap between treasury and corporate is small, buy treasury. When larger buy corporate\n-\tKeep the tax efficient investments in taxable accounts and tax inefficient investments in sheltered accounts\n-\tRebalancing over long term has an estimated benefit of 0.5% per year\n-\tRebalance every year or two. Try to do it with distributions and not selling assets\n-\tIn a taxable account, rebalance with distributions (dividends, contributions, etc.)\n-\tIn retirement, sell your best performers to rebalance\n-\t&amp;quot;More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun&amp;quot;",
