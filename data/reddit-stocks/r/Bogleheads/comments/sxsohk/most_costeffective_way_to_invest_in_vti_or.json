I promised him I'd figure out the best way to go about investing in a broad index fund and that I'd set it up for him.\n\nSo, my question: what is the cheapest/cost-effective way to go about investing in VTI or similar on a monthly basis in small, equal amounts? He'd be looking to continue investing $30-50/month for the foreseeable future and increasing that amount as he gets older.\n\nA separate, but related question, would it make sense to invest in a mix of US and global equities, perhaps at an 80/20 split or something along those lines for a kid his age?\n\nAppreciate any concrete suggestions and advice. Thanks very much in advance.",
