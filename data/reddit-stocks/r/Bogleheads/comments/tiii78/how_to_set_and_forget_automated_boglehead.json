But I’ll use this for example’s sake.\n\nBefore we begin. A couple notes worth mentioning:\n\n-\tYes, these are mutual funds, so they are a TINY bit more expensive in terms of cost basis than ETFs, but to you will make up more than that difference, just by having this system on autopilot.\n-\tThis part confused me at first: In order to set up auto investing with Schwab you must first OWN at least one share of the thing you want to set up auto investing for. So buy one SWISX and one SWTSX before you start this process I listed above. If you’re confused call the Schwab support number. You’ll get a human in 5 mins or less. They’re excellent as I’m sure you know.\n-\tThis frustrated me: Because there are several steps to setting this up which require fund transfers, it will probably take a week or 2 to get everything exactly as you want it. 15 minutes here… (wait 2 days for transfer to clear)… 15 minutes there… etc. You won’t be able to set the whole system up all at once. Just be patient. It’s worth it once it’s set up. \n-\tThe only true disadvantage I’ve found to this approach is that I believe SWISX does not expose you to SMALL cap international stocks which may create a slight deviation in performance compared to say… “Total world excluding US” funds such as VXUS at Vanguard. But again. I thought it was worth stomaching that small negative, for the huge positive of having auto investing in place.\n\nWe will be using Schwab’s auto investing feature for mutual funds. It will take a bit of setup but once you get it set up it can automatically invest a percentage of your paycheck each pay period at your desired allocation. \n\nDo not confuse “automatic investing” with Schwab’s “Schwab intelligent portfolios” the intelligent portfolios thing is just schwabs robo advisor. That’s not what we’re looking for. \n\nTo find automatic investing:\n\nIn Charles Schwab, you have to go to “Trade” along the top menu, then click “Mutual Funds” from the sub-menu, and then you’ll see that you have two options — to trade mutual funds, or another option, “Automatic Investing,” which lets you set up automatic investing instructions for funds that you’re already in.  \n\nWithout further ado, here’s how to set up the system:\n\n1.\tSet your checking account to make a scheduled transfer of 15% (or whatever percentage of your paycheck you want to invest each month) into your investment account at Schwab once per pay period, a couple days after you get paid. So if you get paid on the 1st and 14th of each month, set the transfers to happen on the 3rd and 16th just to allow time to be 100% sure that your check is fully deposited and available in your checking account.\n2.\tNow you’ve got 15% of your check going into your investment account each month. Now you just need to auto invest it. So let’s say you want to do 60% US, 40% international. And let’s pretend that 15% of your paycheck is $1000 just for examples sake. Set Schwab auto investing to buy $600 of SWTSX and $400 of SWISX a few days after you have scheduled the money to transfer into your investment account. So In this case… on the 18th and 20th of each month. \n3.\tRebalance once a year. Aka, if your international has performed so well over the course of a year that it’s grown to 70% of your portfolio when you want it to be 60%, then sell 10% of it and buy domestic U.S. SWTSX with it to keep your desired 60/40 US/INTL split. \n\n\nThere you go! Automatic investing!\n\nI hope this helps you! I’ve been running it this way for awhile now and it’s pretty worry free once you get it set up! Prevents my dumb monkey brain from trying to time the market or reallocate my percentages when little blips in the market happen. \n\nResources:\n-\tMe. Seriously. Send me a message if you have issues I’d love to help. I researched this for hours and hours just to do it once. Might as well use that knowledge I have kicking around in my brain to help someone else haha. \n-\tSchwab support. They are really awesome and if you explain the concept of what you want to do they will help you with the technical aspects. \n\nHappy investing!",
