My father is living off disability because he had a stroke a few years ago and my mother has stopped working and is living off cash my grandfather gave my parents before he died. She won’t tell me how much he gave them. \n\nThey have no mortgage and live in a pretty affordable suburban town on the East Coast. However, the house they live in has 3 judgements on it from the 1990s (my father had a failed business and couldn’t make his credit card payments… we were able to stay in the house because of the homestead rule that says you can’t take someone’s house if it’s their sole residence). \n\nAnyhow, my parents are frugal but just bad with money. They never learned to invest and have no savings. \n\nI inherited my grandfather’s house and it’s worth about 250K as is, but worth more if updated and renovated (contractors in the area are quoting around 40K for a full renovation).\n\nHow can I use the house to fund my parents’ retirement? Would it be wiser to rent it out and build equity or to sell it and put the money into Vanguard index funds and bonds for them? Furthermore, I’m not sure how I can put a huge chunk of cash into a tax advantaged retirement account for them as neither of them work anymore…. Not sure if my mom plans on working again in the future, but I advised her to start a Roth IRA and max it out for herself and my father if she works / had taxable income in the future. But the annual contribution limits are quite low and there’s not much time for their money to grow.",
