And it’s 80% of my taxable investments. \n\nI have a large position\n(~$100k at current prices) in a publicly traded tech company. At its peak, this position was about $300k. I was an early employee at this company and these were ISO’s and RSU’s that I earned during my employment. Since IPO I’ve already moved out of about half of my position and bought VTI with the proceeds. \n\nMy question is “what am I waiting on to sell the rest of those shares?”\n\nI had previously made a decision that I would sell out of that position at $75. But that’s a totally speculative number. Why not $200? Why not $50? I am bullish on the long term prospects of the company, but if I didn’t already own those shares, there’s no way I would place a bet this large on a single company. \n\nExiting is a pretty painful tax event (my basis is sub-$1.00 per share). But more painful would be getting another 2-3 years down the road and have underperformed VTI. \n\nAnyone have any advice for navigating the emotional/irrational aspects of this decision?",
