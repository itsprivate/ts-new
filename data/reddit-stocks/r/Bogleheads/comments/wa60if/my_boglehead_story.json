  "selftext": "Hi Bogleheads,\n\nI just wanted to say thank you!\n\nUntil few months ago, I had a portfolio actively managed (I'm a former trader) of about 50+ individual stocks, 20+ ETF, a dozen active funds, crypto, as well as self-managed real estate investments. About $5m NW. \n\nLots of stress between managing tenants remotely, and all the market research for the trading. I created a stupidly complex estate with a dozen banks in various countries where I also had to manage overdrafts and currencies. Then income tax in each countries, etc. All that on top of a demanding fulltime job.\n\nOverall, I was performing well (above market) which is probably what \"convinced\" me to keep going. But wellbeing cost was high and the reward little in regards to the time taken away from family and friends. I even lost weight due to the stress and lack of sleep.\n\nLast christmas, my wife helped me accept that I was burning out (I'm 35). I sold everything brutally on December 27th (including real estate which took a few months to close). I couldnt think of any other way out of it.\n\nFor the past 7 months, I DCAed daily (roughly 1%) all back into 1 unique ETF (Vanguard Life Strategy 80/20) and I'm finally done as of last week! I also invested in REITs (no cash, 100% fixed rate mortgage). I now have a simple and passive portfolio (in 1 unique bank).\nAll I need is to continue DCA monthly on paycheck day. I also took the opportunity to simplify and automate all our personal finances (bills, credit cards, subscriptions, etc) which feels really good too.\n\nOnce again, I want to thank this community for helping me realise that a simple boglehead portfolio will not only enable you to reach you FIRE goal, but most importantly it will also give you freedom and time back for what matters in life...",
