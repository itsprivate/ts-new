(Is that a term anyone uses? It seems apt)\n\nCurrently 48 yo, married, $0 debt.\n\nI am currently planning on an early retirement at about age 55 1/2. We currently have a good sized IRA and 401k balance, and I will continue maxing out my Roth 401(k) and HSA at work for the next 7.5 yrs until we retire. We then won't be touching that nest egg until after 59 1/2, at which point it should grown to more than enough to fund our full retirement.\n\nSo having just paid off the house and cars, we are able to save a lot of cash each month until we retire. So, basically I need to stash away enough in the next 7.5 years to fund our first 4 \"gap years\" of retirement from age 55-59. \n\nOutside of the above work savings, I should have about 48k a year to save. 12k of that we are going to stash in our non-work Roth IRAs. That leaves me with about 36k a year to put \"somewhere\". Trying to decide a \"safe\" plan with some opportunity for growth. \n\nSince we are getting out early at 55, I am open to the option of working an extra year or so if things were to go too far south, so I have a little higher risk tolerance there if it means I can grab some decent gains.\n\nIf it were you, what would you do? Maybe just a straight 60/40 or 50/50 3 fund portfolio? Mostly bonds? Keep a lot in cash? I hear a lot of different things in articles I have read.\n\nThank you in advance for the opinions and info! Loving this community...so much great information and discussion.\n\nCheers",
