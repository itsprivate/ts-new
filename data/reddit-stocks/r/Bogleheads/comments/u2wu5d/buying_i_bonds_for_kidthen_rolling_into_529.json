It's a way to buy more I bonds...and then contribute the returns tax free into 529 plan for my kid. Appreciate any feedback...\n\nStep 1) Open Minor linked account for my kid under my own on TreasuryDirect\n\nStep 2) Buy $10k I bonds for my kid this year, before end April\n\nStep 3) Next year, when interests rates come down, redeem the I bond (waiting 3 more months so the interest penalty is in the low interest regime)\n\nStep 4) I do understand that the money at this point is my daughter's, not mine. I can only spend it on things to benefit her. Like her future education. So I can't withdraw to my own accounts. But I can put it in an new UTMA account for her, that she owns.\n\nStep 5) Instantly roll that withdrawn money over to a Custodial 529 account from the UTMA account. It can then grow tax free thereafter until College.\n\nThe key here, is that next year when she withdraws, she has to declare around $800 income from the I bond (approximating to 8.0% blended interest for next 12 months). BUT, her standard deduction is $1,150 next year. So no tax due, not even a tax return needing to be filed.\n\nSo, the benefits are:\n\n\\- I get to invest another $10,000 in I bonds at high rates\n\n\\- Don't have to pay any tax on the interest\n\n\\- Money ends up in 529 account at the end of it, growing tax free\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nBut wait - there's more!\n\nUsing Gift Box, I can also pre-buy 2023's bonds for her now too. Deliver them Jan 1, 2023. If she holds them just a little bit longer and redeems them start of 2024, it will hit the 2024 standard deduction and this second amount won't be taxable either! Roll that into the 529 too and I've made $1,600 risk free and tax free growth, then added to her 529 fund.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there anything I'm missing here? In particular I'm not sure about Step 4, how you withdraw from a minor account on TreasuryDirect into a UTMA for the kid. There doesn't seem to be any documentation around the mechanics of it. But I think it can be done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best article on this topic is the one below, but I think my strategy overcomes all the pitfalls...\n\n[https://thefinancebuff.com/buy-i-bonds-kids-name.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/buy-i-bonds-kids-name.html)",
