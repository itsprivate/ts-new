Retired recently with $2.5M in assets:\n\n\\- $700k home, $400k left to pay (1% mortgage, 23 years left),  \n\\- $200k miscellaneous: emergency fund, a bit of gold, a few collectible watches (the good, liquid ones),  \n\\- $2300k stock portfolio. Calculated beta 1.12\n\nI don't count my home and misc. as assets cause they're not productive.\n\nSo I'm living off of my investment portfolio which is basically the following:\n\n\\- $2000k msci world + sp500 etf  \n\\- $300k nasdaq etf + us/int growth stocks\n\nI made good profit by buying stocks during covid, but I feel like my purchasing power got hit because of inflation. I'm wealthy on paper but I definitely got to be careful of my expenses otherwise I'll be consuming capital. I'm living on $60-70k a year which is about 3% of my investment portfolio (selling what I need every 3 months).\n\nA few questions here:\n\n**- Do you guys think I can keep living the same lifestyle (inflation adjusted) for the rest of my life, with my current portfolio?** Mortgage monthly payments are a bit heavy but they'll be over one day, also chances are that I'll inherit a few hundred k$'s at some point--I'm not relying on that though.\n\n**- How does my portfolio look?** My risk tolerance is very high and I'd like to get somewhat wealthier, hence the tilt toward growth. I don't feel the need to add bonds, and I have gold already. The only thing I'll consider would be buying investment real estate but current yield is too low and financing conditions are deteriorating. \n\n**- Does it make sense to sell my gold and my watches?** I don't believe gold will be useful anytime (in case of black swan, I'd rather have a gun) and I don't like wearing expensive watches so they basically stay at the bank, in my insured safe (which is a pointless expense).\n\n**- Do you think I need to work on a backup plan?** Like a side hustle, or getting ready to go back work in case things go wrong. I feel like I don't need to, and I'd like to avoid it by any means, but do you guys feel like my situation is risky?",
