That way you may capture at least some marginal improvement in the flat rate (assuming rates potentially go up a bit between now and then) and you still lock in the current high inflation rate for at least six months? I've seen a lot of people talking about the need to buy in January (presumably to capture the 7.12% rate for a couple more months), but it seems to me you can still lock that high inflation rate with the potential for an improved flat rate if you wait a month or two. Am I missing something?",
