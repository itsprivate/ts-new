Just a few residual logistical questions to confirm from seasoned users:\n\n1. Overall context - my family currently holds an emergency fund consisting of 12 months of expenses, in a ‘high yield’ saving account (0.4% right now). My thought is to start building an I bond ladder so that half of the emergency stash is there, with the balance remaining in readily available cash. If anyone thinks this is not a prudent idea for emergency funds I’m happy to understand why or alternatives. \n\n2. After holding an I Bond for the minimum first year, how soon are the funds available (i.e a few business days for the bank transfer)? This is in the context of being emergency funds (and I know I’d lose the three months interest). \n\n3.  To confirm the timing of rate transfers, you are guaranteed the current rate for six months from your purchase date, and not up to the next May or November official rate change? For example, if I buy bonds in November, I get the current rate through April. If I buy next April, I’m still guaranteed the current rate through September, because I bought before the May switch?\n\n4. My family consists of my spouse and infant child. If I was only interested in buying 20k in bonds per year (right now at least) - would it be logistically more efficient to set up my account and create a linked minor account for my child, to manage everything in one place? Or, safer to set up separate accounts for myself and spouse? I understand that I would have to delink and transfer my child’s holdings back to me while they were still a minor, but I’ve got 17 years until I’d need to worry about that. \n\nAny insight or tips are appreciated, thanks!",
