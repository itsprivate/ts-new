My 4yr grant was worth $850k a few months ago, but has since lost a lot of value (now in the 400s) as it is one of the growth stocks getting beat up. It seems to be trending back up a little - but I’ve already learned a quick lesson not to assume my equity value over the long haul. \n\nMaking an optimistic assumption (and fully contradicting myself from my previous sentence) I should be able to add at least $100k to the market each of the next 4 years without touching my regular base pay. No debt/student loans. \n\nI lumped 60k into VTI last month through a combo of existing savings and some\nof my already vested equity; have $45k in a pre tax IRA that I’ve been rolling previous employer 401ks into when I change jobs - and a current 401k worth only about 5k right now with my\nnew employer. Also holding 45k in savings for a rainy day. \n\nIs it realistic for me to target retirement before I’m 50 if I just regularly contribute to VTI whatever my equity is worth as it vests? I get about 9k after taxes per month now, could be more or could be less each month pending how our stock goes. I’ve been planning to sell and reinvest as it becomes available to me. \n\nTLDR; if I do nothing but put my equity into VTI as it vests over the next 4 years, would it be realistic to think I could retire in 15 years?\n\nAny other approaches you’d recommend?",
