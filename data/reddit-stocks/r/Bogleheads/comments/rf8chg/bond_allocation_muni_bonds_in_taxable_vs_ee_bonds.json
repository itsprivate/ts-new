  "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm 30 years from retirement with a moderate risk tolerance. I'm currently holding 100% stocks (70% VTI / 30% VXUS) in a Roth IRA (contributing $500 per month) and 401k (contributing $1,000 per month). I have $20,000 in I bonds as an emergency fund replacement and will likely be buying more in the future.\n\nI also receive \\~$10,000/year in company stock. I want to start selling the company stock in order to add bonds to my portfolio in a taxable account. However, I'm struggling to make that leap given current yields and the inevitability of interest rate hikes.\n\nBased on the research I've done I've come up with two options that make sense to me:\n\n1. EE bonds. The guaranteed 3.5% APY after 20 years is fairly attractive. Overall, they seem like a good combination of yield and security. I won't be looking to sell them until the 20 year mark so the low yield in the meantime isn't an issue. Having to use the Treasury Direct UI isn't a problem for me. Also, I don't see myself wanting to contribute more than $10,000 per year towards bonds for a long time so the $10,000 limit on EE bonds is not a concern.\n2. A muni bond fund (VTEB or HYMB) in a taxable account. The yield should be a bit better than 3.5% and they are tax-exempt. However, they carry interest rate risk and risk of default.\n\nWhich would you chose in my situation? Is there a better option that I'm overlooking? Thanks!",
