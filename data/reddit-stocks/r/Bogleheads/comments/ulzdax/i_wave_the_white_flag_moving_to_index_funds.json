This volatile market is driving me CRAZY, im checking my phone everyday , losing sleep, it driving me nuts. Like last night, i literally could not sleep. Literally could not sleep. I'm 35, I thought I could handle these wide swings but now I realize I cant.  When  brokerage firms ask me \"whats my risk tolerance\", now that I've *been* through this type of velocity, I know its not *aggressive.*\n\nI originally viewed investing as a game of wealth accumulation but after experiencing this massive downturn, ive come to realize that the name of the game, rule number is 1, is capital preservation.  \n\nI dont know how I let the fomo of the 2020/2021 market get to me. I think it was because there was so much talk around the wealth creation in the stock market that if I didnt get on one of these high growth stocks and/or smart beta ETFs, i would be 'leaving money on the table'. What a dumb idea:\n\nIf i do nothing else except put my money into a a 3 fund bogle head/index fund tied to my age/risk tolerance and add just max out my 401k, wifes 401k, and our backdoor ira 2x, we'll retire with like \\~$10m by the time we're 65. Im just ranting now.  So tired of checking fidelity every 5 minutes, happy to be here and thank you.",
