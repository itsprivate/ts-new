I assumed that a target date fund would mean I would earn a bit less than if I was 100% in stocks, but that it would be safer and cap my losses. The difference in losses YTD isn't that much (although YoY is a different story), but the S&amp;P 500 gained 28% in 2021 while FDKLX only gained 15% from what I remember. If I'm going to lose just as much as the S&amp;P 500 while not making as much money when it's running hot, it seems like the only advantage to holding the target date fund is that it will allocate more bonds as I approach retirement. I'm thinking of selling out of this and entering VTI/VXUS and maybe a small portion in BND as I have about 40 years until retirement. Good or bad idea?",
