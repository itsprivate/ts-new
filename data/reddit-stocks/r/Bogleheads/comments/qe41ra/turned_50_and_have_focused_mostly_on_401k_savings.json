We have no debt except for the mortgage. \n\nI didn't start doing any serious retirement savings, unfortunately, until I got to my late 30's. Since then I have increased my 401k contributions annually and am contributing to the max allowed each year. This is well over the matching my employer provides, which is 3% (I forget the exact calc but I have to contribute 6% to get the 3% match). I'm contributing 18%.\n\nWe have the Roth IRAs that we invested a few thousand into a long time ago, and I got lucky and changed the allocations about 7 years ago from some bad funds that a former advisor steered them to, to AAPL, TSLA, and a little SBUX. Those have done well but it's only $40k now as I never contributed.\n\nAshamed to say but it just occurred to me that 401k distributions will be taxed upon withdrawal. I guess I just never worried about that before. I just always focused on getting as much in the 401k, along with cash for emergencies. We're cash flowing the current college expense but will need to either pinch a little or start dipping into the 529/cash during the two years both kids are in college at same time.\n\nThe HSA I'm in is relatively new. Had a decent traditional PPO plan but like many, my employer went cheap and now most of us are on a high deductible plan with an HSA. I just looked at it closely and I can only invest a couple hundred of the 1.2k that's sitting in it.\n\nHere's why I'm now all of a sudden concerned: wife and I have come to start really thinking about how we want to live our lives when in our 60's, and a big dream of ours is a vacation home (beach house). Right now, we'd be looking at about $600k to buy a modest one in our desired location, so that could go up quite a bit in 10 years. I had been thinking for years, no problem, use some of the 401k. But if it's taxed on the distributions then that's probably not a good idea.\n\nI'm thinking my best option now is to begin maxing out the Roth IRAs each year going forward. Side note - those Roth accounts are through TDAmeritrade. As I wrote previously, right now its all in individual stocks. So going forward I'm assuming I should go with index funds offered through TDAmeritrade (I haven't looked yet but will to see what they offer).\n\nLastly - I have a well paying job that is fairly secure. I plan to work until at least 60 but likely will need to continue working until 65.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.",
