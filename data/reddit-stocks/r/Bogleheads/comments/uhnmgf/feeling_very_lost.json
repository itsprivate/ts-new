When we got married we combined everything under the same advisor. I grew up extremely poor so I became an excellent saver, but investing has always confused and scared me. Because of that, I was more than happy to have someone else handle things. My husband is the same way. He works a minimum of 50 hours a week and has no time or energy to invest in trying to wrangle investments.\n\nWe checked in with this person once a year and everything looked good. He shows us fancy charts that say we are on track for retirement. Last year I became interested in FIRE and decided I wanted to attempt to retire early. I started looking at our accounts more, not really understanding but at least digging around for the first time. I saw that we are paying $22K towards whole life insurance each year. I don't even remember agreeing to insurance. A quick Google of WLI made my stomach drop. Meanwhile, our 401K accounts are not maxed out and there are many different areas we could use $22K a year other than insurance.\n\nI emailed our advisor immediately and said I wanted to get out of the WLI. You can imagine how that went. I feel taken advantage of and angry. But now, I'm so lost and I don't know how to get out of this. Every single asset we have (except work 401Ks) is with this person. I don't even begin to know how to unravel from them, but I also no longer have any trust and don't want them managing my money. I've called several other fee-based advisors, but they all want a percentage to manage the portfolio. Currently what our advisor manages is roughly a worth of $400K.\n\nI don't really want anyone to fully manage it. I want someone to help me draw a map and then I can call them if I get lost, but I don't want them on the road trip if that makes sense. My husband is very unsure about leaving this advisor as he doesn't have confidence that we can manage the money ourselves and build enough for retirement.\n\nI don't know how to surrender the WLI policies in the correct way or move accounts from the advisor to something else without major financial or tax implications. I've tried to learn as much as I can online, but it just leaves me frustrated and depressed. I'm also overwhelmed trying to comb through the millions of choices for term life to replace the WLI, now that we are older (40s/50s) it is more expensive and harder to get. ",
