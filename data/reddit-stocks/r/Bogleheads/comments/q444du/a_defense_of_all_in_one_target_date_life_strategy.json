If you like tinkering and manually maintaining your own asset allocation, more power to you, but I don't think these points make or break the typical hands off investor's decision.\n\nI'd like to address the ability to choose which one to sell from. Yes, if there is a market downturn, you can choose to sell bonds instead of stocks while stock valuations are depressed. Don't buy high and sell low. However, there's a few admittedly counterintuitive reasons why that's actually detrimental to your strategy.\n\nIf you were holding 60% stocks and 40% bonds before a drop, your portfolio will be out of balance after a drop. Say it's 50/50. If you then didn't adjust things and started selling bonds to get back to your desired allocation without touching stocks, you would be underweight stocks until you sold enough bonds to get back to 60/40. If you rebalanced by selling bonds and buying stocks, and then sold more bonds while you wait for stocks to recover, you'd actually be diverging from your desired asset allocation. If the point of the all in one fund is to maintain a desired risk level with a constant asset allocation, you've diverged from your strategy and you're now market timing (which will probably be more profitable in the long run, but that's because you're incurring more risk than desired).\n\nThe other argument I see is that after a downturn, with a single fund if you need money, you'd be selling stocks while they're low. This is true. However, you'd be selling stocks you just bought by rebalancing bonds into them. So you're buying cheap stocks, and then selling cheap stocks. No buy high sell low happening, just buy low sell low. And you've maintained your desired asset allocation.\n\nHopefully I've convinced a few people that there's not a ton of harm in recommending all in one funds to people who truly want to set and forget their investments. I personally only use them in my 401k (no better option) because I like managing my own allocation, but I acknowledge that it's the right choice for most people. Thanks for reading!",
