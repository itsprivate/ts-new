  "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo here’s my situation. A good friend of my wife and I ( both 28) recently left Baird to move to Edward Jones in our town. My wife has a finance degree and handles most of the day to day banking stuff, budgeting etc. and had some conversations with our friend about setting up some meetings. We had the first two meetings and we both we’re feeling really optimistic about the experience moving forward.\n\nFast forward about a month and I’ve been deep in the rabbit hole about what I want to do with our money. She has roughly $40,000 her previous companies 401k and I have around $5,000 from my previous employers 401k (We both currently work for our family business with no investment/retirement options.) And I’m just feeling a bit less excited about handing my portion to him. In a way, I want my friend to succeed and I don’t mind giving him the business but I also don’t want to take six figure losses overtime in order to help a buddy get started. \n\nI know this sub will most likely tell me to run not walk away from that office but I believe I’m just looking for a little bit of reassurance from people with more experience and a like minded approach in investing. \nMy wife has no interest in doing any of this herself and wants the peace of mind of having someone she trusts managing her retirement and a 529 for our daughter. I want to take my $5,000, open a Roth at Vanguard, set up automatic investments of VTWAX and let it ride. As of now I have no interest in day trading or watching the needle. I just want to get my funds in somewhere and let it work with very little effort. The agent has not disclosed what fees look like or any of the likely unsavory details but I feel like I will come out much better in my proposed scenario. \n\nAm I making the right choice? Does it make sense to have our money spread out? Is there any downside in having her retirement and 529 managed through EJ while my portion sits with Vanguard? I would really appreciate any takes (hot or cold) that you all have to offer as well as any insight to this situation as I have a meeting with the FA tomorrow afternoon. Love this sub and all of the info you guys provide. \n\nThanks,\n\n-\tParalyzed in Tennessee",
