It's simple and efficient, and looking at historical returns, it's a good strategy.\n\nBut as we all know, past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. Still people in subs like this one here preach to just keep DCAing and to not time the market. Whatever someone asks or suggests, the cult-like response is always: I just keep buying.\n\nI am wondering where you take the confidence from that this approach will continue to work. IMHO it only works under the assumption that in the long run the underlying index (ie. the underlying economy) will keep growing. If you DCA into an S&amp;P500 fund, you're making a bet that the US economy will keep growing in the long run. If you DCA into a Vanguard All World fund you're betting that the world economy will keep growing in the long run.\n\nBut in order for that to be the case, there needs to be growth of the companies that make up those economies. Such growth can only be achieved by increasing revenues or decreasing costs (or both); increasing revenues can be achieved by selling more for the same price, and/or selling at higher prices, and/or selling new/additional products. And my question is where that growth shall come from?\n\n\\- In the past, our domestic societies kept growing and were technologically underdeveloped, so there was already growth opportunity domestically. You didn't have to look abroad necessarily. Today, our domestic populations are aging and are highly developed.\n\n\\- In the past, globalization enabled us to both reduce costs, as well as to sell more, by going abroad with our products and productions. Today, we are living in a world that looks to de-globalise into blocks of free western democracies on the one hand and authoritarian regimes on the other hand. Future population growth will not be in our block, but in countries that are or are friendly with authoritarian regimes, and those are also the countries that are underdeveloped.\n\nSo I am wondering where that future growth shall come from that would be required to justify to keep DCAing, assuming that the world continues on the current path. For DCAing to be successful, something has to give and I am wondering what that is.",
