Some money in my Roth I contribute to monthly, I’ll havea pension when I retire, and I’m about to make $100g on a sale of a property. What do I do? Im not buying any properties in this market, especially with the mortgage rate. I’m not into big risks. I’ve had more than one person tell me to put it into crypto currency, but I just don’t understand it, and that makes me want to stay away. I know I’m old enough to know, but I spent the majority of my life just trying to survive. I never learned what to do with money, because I never had it. \n\nThank you in advance for any help!",
