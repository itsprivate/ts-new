A common rule of  thumb suggests that households should have three to six months’ worth of expenses set aside for a  rainy day. In this paper, we’ll explore a more nuanced view of emergency savings and household liquidity.  By understanding what we’re actually saving for when we talk about emergency savings, we can determine  how much is appropriate and how maintaining adequate cash and liquidity reserves fits into a broader financial  plan to save for long-term goals. For the purposes of this paper, we define liquidity as the ability to convert  an investment into cash quickly and cheaply, and we define emergency savings as a combination of cash  and liquidity maintenance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Three key points to consider when saving for emergencies:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Understand financial shocks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Set aside cash for common  spending shocks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Balance risks and long-term  goals to mitigate income shocks.\n\nConclusion:\n\n&gt;Planning for the unexpected can turn a potential crisis into a manageable setback.  Everyone’s financial picture is unique, so it’s important to think through the potential  risks you’re exposed to and develop strategies that mitigate these risks while balancing  financial priorities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Spending shocks are a fact of life, and maintaining an appropriate cash reserve for them  should be a top priority for all investors. It’s prudent to have half a month to a month’s  worth of expenses in cash beyond what’s needed for typical monthly cash flows.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Income shocks are less likely but can cause severe financial disruption. Take advantage  of the flexibility afforded by certain account types such as Roth IRAs, and understand  how savings toward future goals can also help meet liquidity needs.",
