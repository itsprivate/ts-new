I have mainly been following random advice I found online, and I just discovered this subreddit today  so I figured I’d ask for more random advice, online… Currently all of that money is invested in an S&amp;P 500 ETF, but now I’m considering diversifying my portfolio. I’m really apprehensive about investing bonds though considering that I still have around 50 years left before retirement. I’m considering putting 80% in total market index and 20% in international market index. Is it okay to exclude bonds when I’m this young? Also how do you approach balancing your portfolio? Say, if your US stocks grew 100% but your international grew 50%, would you sell of some US stocks to buy more international (since it’d now be close to a 85/15 balance) to keep the 80/20 balance or would you just keep dumping in money in an 80/20 balance and let the account do what it’s going to do? Thanks so much for any help!!!",
