I also was advised to open a 401k through my employer even though they don't match.\n\nJust wanted clarification as I am new to this especially around tax season. Do I need to file any special forms etc since I have money in these two accounts? In addition, since I opened my Roth IRA recently, I am able to try to catch up with the 6k max for 2021. I just received my paper work from my employer to do taxes, but would it be better to wait till last minute to file it? (April 15 around there I think) so I can capitalize on catching up to max out the 2021 as much as I can or should I just file it now and move on to 2022's 6k max. Thanks in advance.   \n\n\nP.S. I didn't have enough for the 3k minimum for VTSAX and VTIAX so I am doing VTI + VXUS currently. Once I hit the 3k mark for both should I transition to the index funds or keep as is. Hope you guys have a great weekend!",
