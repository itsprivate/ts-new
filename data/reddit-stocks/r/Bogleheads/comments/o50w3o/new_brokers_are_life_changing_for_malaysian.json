Our options are Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade - which are horribly expensive to fund the USD accounts from MYR.\n\nStarting from 2020, there are 3 brokers that have launched - Tiger Brokers (NASDAQ:TIGR), Futu Moomoo (NASDAQ:FUTU), and CGSCIMB's [Prosperus](https://www.prosperus.asia/).\n\nTiger and Futu are basically the Robinhood app in China, and now they have expanded aggressively to capture the market of Chinese diasporas and southeast asians. But neither Tiger nor Futu offer access to London stock exchange, so for a few months, I was buying up VXUS. \n\nThe problems with US domiciled ETFs are low estate tax threshold and 30% dividend taxes. If we die with more than USD 60000 under our name, Uncle Sam could take 40% of whatever is worth more than that. And 30% div tax is a big yikes for MY SG HK residents who never had to pay tax on dividends and capital gains.\n\nr/singaporefi has revered VWRA for a while now. It's Irish domiciled, traded on London, behave like VT, albeit slightly less diversified. \n\nAnd then CGSCIMB launched their new Prosperus platform last week. And they offer dirt cheap access to London.\n\nFunding these accounts got really easy for Malaysians. We can now open a SGD bank account with CIMB Singapore, then transfer MYR over to SGD with services like transferwise, bigpay, sunway, or moneymatch. [Ziet is very kind for showing us how.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iewPJW2VFvk)\n\nI am so glad I am finally able to invest like bogleheads. But for now I still gonna keep some monies in robo-advisors like StashAway and Endowus, and gamble on some local stock counters in KLSE and SGX.",
