I’m trying to decide whether going 100% traditional is worth it. \n\nLet’s assume that whatever tax break I get from traditional, I would take that lump sum that I saved and throw it directly into VTI/VXUS in a taxable account (let’s assume I’ve already maxed my Roth IRA). \n\nMathematically, how would I go about determining which of the following is most favorable: \n\n* 100% traditional, reinvesting the tax savings into ETFs. \n\n* 50/50, as I’m doing now. \n\n* 100% Roth.\n\nA few things about me: \n\nI’m 26, make ~150k, so I’m in the 24% marginal bracket. I also live in NYC which means Uncle Sam loves me - I pay 4% state income tax and another 3.7% in city income tax. I max my 401k, Roth IRA through backdoor, and put the rest in taxable. \n\n A few thoughts: \n\n-Given my age and current earnings, I firmly believe I’ll be in the 32% bracket in the next 5-10 years. \n\n-Given my absurd state and city taxes, would that automatically make the 100% traditional worth it if I simply retired in Florida or Texas to have 0 income tax? I don’t know my retirement income tax bracket but I sure as hell can estimate I can have 7% less tax liability by simply living in those states. \n\n-If I go 100% traditional and invest the tax savings, is there merit to doing this to allow those savings to compound while I’m young? E.g. I’m thinking it may make more sense to do this now, get the savings in the market and let it work for me early than sacrifice that by going Roth. \n\n-Any help on how I’d set this up as a math problem would be helpful!",
