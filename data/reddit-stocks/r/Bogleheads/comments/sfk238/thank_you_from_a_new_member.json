  "selftext": "Hello fellow bogleheads,\nThank you for your constant conversations and for sharing your knowledge on your free time.\nThis is my story: I started investing in 2020 and with the luck of the almighty noob run I managed to increase my initial investment with an individual Chinese stock. After a while I hated the volatility and decided to take some profits and take advantage of the 20k tax free allowance of my ISA on the same platform (212) and simply invested into several ETFs not knowing what I was doing but simply for the sake of diversification and the fact that it‚Äôs tax free. I done further research ,on Reddit of course , and then stumbled upon FIREUK and fell in love with the idea and did further digging. Quick note, I am currently studying business/finance and for a very long time now I‚Äôve always had an interest in investment but only started REALLY looking into investing around July 2021. I knew there was no way I could carry on a noob run like in 2020 and wanted to make my portfolio safer and more simplistic.  Then YOU ALL showed up. I have learned so much literally so much and I feel like I have so much more knowledge to acquire that it sort of excites me. I have read the articles and wikis the sub offers (literally for\nFREE how amazing) and I can truly say I understand the theory of this sub and I am ready for the 40+ years of investing. I am currently 21 years old and have deposited my first ¬£500 into FTSE all world cap index fund - accumulation in the Vanguard S&amp;S isa. The isa one my 212 and vanguard are from different financial years so not to worry that I accidentally used two ISAs in one year(I have seen this mistake happen to some on Reddit and learned from it ) My career is going to start end of this year and I am happy I have this ready to invest into monthly when I start my first full time job. Thank you peopleü§ôüèæ \n\nPlease be feel free to give me any advice on bond allocation as I‚Äôm learning more about bond allocation currently that I hope will come in handy in a few years or when I‚Äôm 30.",
