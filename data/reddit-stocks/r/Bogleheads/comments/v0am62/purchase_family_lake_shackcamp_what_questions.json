The property is located in upstate NY and I live in the mountain West. My spouse and I love the place. I grew up there and spend 1-3 months at the shack every summer. If they were to put it on the market, they believe they could get 350K and it would probably be a teardown for someone who wanted to build a fancy home on a developing lake. I except the value of the property to do well in the future and am thinking of it as both a summer home and alternative investment. We are new Bogleheads, DINKs in 40s, secure jobs, middle class, saved only $420K for retirement so far. Only debt is 15-year mortgage with 2.25 interest rate. So far, I could (1) drain our ROTHs for half and pay my parents $500 a month, no interest; (2) look into a second mortgage (my current home has doubled in value); (3) other ideas (conventional mortgage is not an option)? To maintain the place, we would need to stop maxing out our ROTHs but would still continue contributing 20% of income to 401K. Please help me brainstorm this! Should we let it go as we would like to have security in retirement at age 68 or so? Thank you!!",
