I wanted to see which is a better bet.\n\nI've known about FIRECalc since last summer. It's a really great tool, and it helped me understand how taking risk is advantageous at my age. Recently, I found cFIREsim, which is like FIRECalc but also lets you set a glide path. So I decided to take a likely investment scenario ($6000/year into a Roth IRA until I turn 60) and see how it played out if I invested in a fund with a glide path versus just 100% equities. I approximated the glide path of the Fidelity Freedom Index 2060 fund until my retirement year.\n\nEquities only: [https://www.cfiresim.com/347651dc-fa77-4827-b485-5e66fe1f9c4c](https://www.cfiresim.com/347651dc-fa77-4827-b485-5e66fe1f9c4c) (98% success rate)\n\nTarget retirement fund: [https://www.cfiresim.com/a65aea6c-d401-46e0-bf40-308e6c0e1b0d](https://www.cfiresim.com/a65aea6c-d401-46e0-bf40-308e6c0e1b0d) (61% success rate)\n\nDespite a lot of advice I've read to adjust your mix of stocks and bonds as you near retirement, this data doesn't seem to support that, at least in my case. Am I failing to consider something else here, or is it actually just better for me to invest in 100% equities and keep that allocation all the way through my retirement?",
