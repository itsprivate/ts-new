I'm 25 and make 60K with no debt.\n\n**Traditional and Roth TSP**\n\nI started my contributions to my traditional TSP with a 5% match and have been doing that since September 2020. I then found out that at a lower-income like myself I should be putting my money into a Roth TSP so I started doing that this past August (2021) at 5%, while still contributing 5% to the traditional TSP. So now I'm contributing 5% to both, but I feel like I should be contributing 10% to one of them. I make 60K and will be working for the federal government for the foreseeable future (potentially forever) so I'm in the lowest-tax bracket I'll ever be in, but I don't think I'm able to switch the money in the traditional to the Roth. Does anyone have any insight here? I haven't been able to find anything definitive.  \n\n\n**Roth IRA**\n\nI'm currently 50% in SPY and 50% in VOO, which I realize now are basically the same thing. For this, can I call Fidelity and say I'd like to move money out of SPY **AND** VOO and into VTI and VXUS to do a 70/30 VTI/VXUS? Or do I sell just my contributions to SPY/VOO and then buy VTI/VXUS? I'm not sure the mechanics here in how to do that or if that's a good spread for a Roth IRA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Individual**\n\nI created this account to put passive investments into that I can pull out in years down the road for a house payment or big vacation. Should this reflect what I put in my ROTH IRA? Do another 70/30 split of VTI/VXUS? This isn't my house fund per-se, my thought is it's a place to put $100 or so a month and hope it grows a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance! I've been stressing about this and about posting here but I hope that, with your help, I can rearrange my portfolio so I can set it and forget it. Thanks for helping guide a new bogle. I received some Kindle gift cards for Christmas and was thinking of getting a bogle book, does anyone have a good recommendation?",
