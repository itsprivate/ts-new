He buys them super cheap and then ends up selling them when they increase. He's literally turned his 10k into 26k, he buys cheap and if it dips he holds no matter what and eventually when the price increases he sells for around 10 - 50% gains. I keep warning him that his strategy is risky and tried to show him a balance sheet of the stocks he's buying telling him they are speculative but he says it's all bullshit and literally thinks he is some kind of trade guru. I showed him videos about Warren Buffet and his buy and hold strategy but when he saw that Warren's average return is only around 10% he says he makes 10% in a few days and that Buffet is a moron and he's smarter then him.\n\nI started with around 20k and from buying and holding index funds and stocks like APPL which have good balance sheets and are actually profitable and I've only made a around 2k as I held through ups and downs. My dad tells me that I'm stupid and I can me making as much as him if I just bought his shit companies sold them when they go up and then buy them again when they go down. Dude literally thinks he's smarter then people who invest professionally and it's pissing me off because no matter what he keeps making money, and far more then me. He's been doing this consistently since March and in all honestly he needs an ego check and I've kind of been secretly wishing his portfolio would crash. He's seen -20% on his picks. he doesn't sell them and a few weeks later he's up 40%.\n\nI'm honestly questioning my own investing strategy, my dad who has no idea what a market cap is, is making more money then me. I'm honestly considering just doing what he's doing cause fuck it. I want money.\n\nCould anyone help me reconsider? It's honestly all getting to my head and upsetting me",
