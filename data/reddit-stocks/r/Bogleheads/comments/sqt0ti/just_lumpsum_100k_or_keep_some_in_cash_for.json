Since then i read various recommended books and decided to lump-sum 35k of my savings into the Vanguard All-world ETF around 2 weeks ago. I have created an emergency fund and plan to invest around 60% of my monthly income into the same ETF for the foreseeable future. \n\nI am extremely priviliged to be receiving 100k from my parents this month. They want to give me my inheritance early (tax considerations also play a role). I thought about saving this money to help me in purchasing in a home but after listening to Ben Felix talk about renting vs buying i am more inclined to invest the money. The main reason for this is that I dont know where i will be in 10 years time. I have been debatting about how much of this money i should lump sum into my all-world vanguard ETF. I have a stable income and an emergency fund and originally thought about putting in the entire 100k. Time in the market &gt; timing the market, and all that. However, i'm beginning to wonder whether this is wise. Don't i want to sit on some cash in the event of a bear market/crash. If i have invested 135k into the market and it crashes in the not too distant future i will only have around 1-2k a month to put into the market when prices are low. Is there any theory that addresses this option? Any advice for my situation (very fortunate situation)?   \n\n\nThanks in advance.   \n\n\nTheChickenRice.",
