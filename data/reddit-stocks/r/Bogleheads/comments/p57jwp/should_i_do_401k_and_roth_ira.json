  "selftext": "Hi all. I have had a Roth 401k for a couple of years with my employer (currently contributing 10%) and I recently started to learn more about investing and the importance of compound interest, consistent contributions, Jack Bogle, long term investing, random walks, bla bla bla. In this context I decided to open a Roth IRA and I've been doing my best to consistently contribute $500 every month, and also invest in index funds like the total stock market or S&P 500, etc.\n\nA week ago a was talking to a friend about all of this, and I was suggesting that he should learn about investing too, and that he should probably also open a Roth IRA. When he asked why he should do that if he already had a 401k with his employer, I felt like I didn't have enough good reasons to justify having both. The one thing I was able to say was that with a Roth IRA you have a lot more options of different funds to invest in, but other than that, I couldn't come up with anything else that sounded convincing lol\n\nWhich make me think, should I continue contributing to a Roth IRA like I'm doing now? Is there any real advantage to having an extra account? Or should I just increase the contribution to my current Roth 401k? -Insert old confused Travolta meme-. I know a Roth IRA is a great investment tool, but I just would like to have more reasons why using both is a good idea (or maybe it's not!)\n\nFinally, if both are good to use side by side, how would you invest in them so that you make them function effectively and efficiently?\n\nI know, a lot of questions, sorry, but I appreciate any information, opinions and/or recommendations 😘\n\nThank you!",
