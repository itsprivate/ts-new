The question she had was why she was hit with double her normal tax bill this year. Her tax bill was so unexpectedly high that she had to sell stock to pay it, which of course will incur even more taxes.\n\nIt turned out she was heavily invested (\\~$1.4mil) in actively managed mutual funds with a moderately high expense ratio (.38-.52%) and high portfolio turnover (\\~25%), in a taxable account. On top of this she is paying an advisory fee that adds up to about $20k per year, and, most concerning, these funds are doing noticeably worse than the S&amp;P500.\n\nThe main culprit lay in her capital gains distributions, which by itself was approx $120,000. This is different from the capital gains you have when you sell stock in your portfolio - distributions are generated by mutual funds when they sell stocks within the mutual fund. This is less of an issue for passive index funds, but for active funds it can result in what we saw in my mom's 1099: a capital gains distribution that can vary wildly from year to year depending on what the fund's managers decide to buy and sell. You have no control over this, and you get hit with the tax bill. You don't even get free money like dividends when this happens. It's literally just Wall Street fat cats making deals and passing the tax bill on to you. \n\nDo the math: 15% long term capital gains tax rate on $120k means she had to pay $18,000 in taxes on JUST the distributions, not even including any other sources of income. The real thorn in the side is that these distributions added nothing to her checking account - it was set to auto-reinvest, so she is paying $18,000 to reinvest in crappy active mutual funds THAT ARE UNDERPERFORMING THE S&amp;P500!!! \n\nLesson learned: Don't put mutual funds in a taxable account, especially active ones, especially ones with high turnover (which results in high distributions). There is a good reason Vanguard developed a proprietary way of hiding distributions in their mutual funds.",
