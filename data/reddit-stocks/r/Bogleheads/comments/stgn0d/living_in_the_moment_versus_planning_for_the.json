Quick question that probably doesn't have a quick explanation: how do you strike a balance between planning for the future and living in the moment? \n\nBackground information for me: I'm a bit \"late\" to the investing game at age 31, but I have a state pension plan (~8% contribution + match) and let's say...15-20k invested in IRA and brokerage accounts over the last couple of years. Both which I started at 29. They are all of our favorite ETFs and index funds (VTI, VXUS, VSTAX). Don't worry about allocations, that's not the question. \n\nI make pre-tax $50k a year, which isn't phenomenal to some of the postings I've seen here, but it is pretty solid in the rural South where I live. I had originally planned on dropping $10k into my accounts this year, and while that is completely doable with my spending habits, it seems like I'm letting some of the good times slide by me. \n\nI keep thinking \"yeah, my retirement account looks good, but it can be better.\" As a consequence, I save and save and save. Is this the right move? How do I know when I'm doing too much? And please avoid generic wisdom like \"do as much as you can stomach\" without imparting something more. I've heard a number of one-liners on this issue and I would really appreciate some substantial feedback. Thanks all! 🙏",
