Some advice is to hold a \"small\" fun money account; John Bogle even accepted the idea of some \"small\" amount of money set aside for fun. But what is the right \"small\" amount of fun money to hold? I think a good benchmark of judging \"how much is too much money\" in a fun account is comparing your loss of returns to that of a high-fee, managed fund.\n\n**A word of caution:** I am just a human too, so if someone can validate my numbers below it would be much appreciated :)\n\n# The Mathematical Model\n\nWe believe that\n\n`index fund return >= managed fund return`\n\nBy introducing fun money, you derive your returns from both index and fun funds...\n\n`(index fund allocation) * (index fund return) + (fun fund allocation) * (fun fund return) >= managed fund return`\n\nLetting your index fund allocation be all the funds that don't go towards fun (1 - fun allocation)...\n\n`(1 - (fun fund allocation)) * (index fund return) + (fun fund allocation) * (fun fund return) >= managed fund return`\n\n... and letting the \"fun fund return\" and \"managed fund return\" be relative to the index fund return (e.g. fun fund return = index fund return + fun fund relative return) ...\n\n`(1 - (fun fund allocation)) * (index fund return) + (fun fund allocation) * ((index fund return) + (fun fund relative performance)) >= (index fund return) + (managed fund relative performance)`\n\nLook's pretty complicated, but we'll simplify it in a moment. Let's set out some more assumptions.\n\n(1) Managed fund's performance relative to indices will be negative -- over time, managed funds lose to indices by their management costs, fees, underperformance, etc.\n\n(2) Your fun fund's performance relative to indices will be negative :) Unless you have information that the general market doesn't, it has already been priced in.\n\nIf you believe either of these assumptions is false you should choose that investment strategy!\n\nSimplifying the above equation, it simply comes down to...\n\n `fun fund allocation * fun fund relative performance >= managed fund relative performance`\n\nor simply\n\n `fun fund relative performance >= managed fund relative performance / fun fund allocation`\n\n `fun fund allocation <= managed fund relative performance / fun fund relative performance`\n\nwhere the relative performance is a gain/loss compared to the index, e.g. -0.015 would be returns 1.5% lower than index returns.\n\n# Implications\n\nAssuming index funds return 8% and managed funds lose 1.5% to fees...\n\n|% of portfolio in \"fun\" money|minimum annualized returns needed on \"fun money\" to not lose to managed fund returns|\n|:-|:-|\n|100%|6.5%|\n|50%|5%|\n|25%|2%|\n|20%|0.5%|\n|15%|\\-2%|\n|10%|\\-7%|\n|5%|\\-22%|\n|3%|\\-42%|\n|1%|\\-142%|\n\n`managed fund relative performance = -0.015; fun fund allocation = 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01; min fun fund relative performance = -0.015, -0.03, -.06, -0.075, -0.1, -0.15, -0.3, -0.5, -1.5`\n\n# tl;dr\n\n\"Fun money\" has the possibility to eat away at our returns; we all know that. In order to know what percentage we can rationally allocate to \"fun\", we should know how risky our \"fun\" investments are and still strive to beat the returns of managed funds. \n\nFor less risky investments in which we can make reasonable returns (expecting annualized returns >= -5%), no more than \\~10% should be put aside for fun. For investments where the entire capital is at risk, no more than \\~1-2% should be set aside. Any more than this and you should consider letting a managed fund handle your money, or be willing to take deeper losses!",
