A reason to have bonds during accumulation is to be able to sell your bonds to buy stocks when they are in the gutter\n\n2. A reason to have bonds is because they are stable and reduce the volatility of your account so you don’t panic sell in a down market( I get this, I KNOW people who have done this)\n\n3.  When you approach retirement, you move to bonds so you lock up your nest egg, and have it there to draw from.\n\n \n\nSo \n\n1. If my bonds have been locked up in a target date fund, they are not able to 1, I’ve been missing out on that strategy\n\n2. If I’ve never sold during a drop, and I’ve actually upped my contributions and bought more MF from my personal savings, then that doesn’t help me either\n\nSo that leaves 3, protecting your nest egg.  This one always confuses me probably more than it should. \n\nPeople say, you need bonds to protect your retirement plan if there is crash as you near retirement or are in retirement.  But I don't get that, if you are at retirement, but don’t have the couple million to lock up the egg in cash/bonds, then wouldn’t you need to leave a lot in the market to hope for gains to improve your spending ability while you use Social Security? \n\nYou'd only loose your egg if for some reason you existed your positions in the downturn, but why would you do that if you need your money in the market to fund an extended retirement as I read everywhere.\n\nSo unless you saved your whole nest egg up and can go 100 cash/bonds, how would this apply, as you have your money in the market during retirement too.  You'd only be taking it out as you go, not all at once.\n\nWould the idea be to have have, say 10 years of living money in cash/bonds to cover a 10 year recovery period on stocks to get back to even and not sell stocks low.",
