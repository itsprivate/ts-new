Very passively invested for a few years and really just got into the goal of retiring early the last couple of months.\n\nI just started a new job where I'll be hitting the IRA contribution limit within a few years. I'd like to retire in 15 - 20 years (after my mortgage is paid off) with the gains from my taxable account until I hit 60 where I can then leverage my retirement accounts.\n\n**Taxable account** ($74K) - Been bouncing between dividends and growth and at the moment I'm 80/20 VTI/VXUS. Currently putting in $100 weekly until I finish building my emergency fund and figure out how much additional I can save.\n\n**Traditional IRA** ($100K) - From the rollovers from my previous jobs. Currently allocated with dividend stocks with SCHD/VYMI taking 20/10 of the account. Not planning to contribute into this.\n\n**Roth IRA** ($12K) - Neglected this for years. Also 80/20 VTI/VXUS. Plan to max the contributions from now on.\n\n**401K** ($0) - Just opened this at my new job with Fidelity. Plan to only contribute 3% to get the employer match. My contributions are post-tax and the employer match is pre-tax. Plan to put all 100% into the FID 500 Index that I'm allowed to choose.\n\n**HSA** ($0) - Just started. Plan is to max it out yearly and invest it into probably 80/20 VTI/VXUS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny feedback would be appreciated. Really trying to see if my goal to retire in 15-20 years is realistic and maybe see if my retirement accounts are in good shape too.",
