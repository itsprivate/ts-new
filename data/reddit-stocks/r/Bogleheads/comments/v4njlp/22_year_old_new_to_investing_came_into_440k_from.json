Came into $440k as a result of a car accident settlement and I'm not sure what to do with that sum of money. My current plan was simply to keep $40k as cash and invest the other 400k over a 24 month period, 80% in fidelity zero total market index fund (FZROX) and 20% in fidelity zero international index fund (FZILX). At such a young age I'm just trying to keep things simple and cheap. Also when I start working in a year I will open a roth ira and have a 401k through my company. Any thoughts on this? Any suggestions or help or insights from anyone with some experience would be a huge help. Thanks!",
