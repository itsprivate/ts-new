Originally I thought I couldn't convert my Simple IRA's due to the pro-rata rule, though you guys made me realize I was misunderstanding the point of the pro-rata rule. Bottom line, I converted 100% of my Simple's along with my non-deductible tIRA's over about 6 weeks recently, around $720,000 between my account and my wife's. I'll be converting all our additional additional contributions as I go throughout this year.\n\nAnyway, this obviously creates a huge tax bill which sucks. But, one silver lining came out of this, and that was, Illinois, which generally is regarded as a high-tax state (total tax load), is one of only 3 states (Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi) that have a personal income tax, but do not tax income/distributions from retirement accounts.\n\nThus, if you make distributions(conversions) from tax-differed IRA an to a Roth IRA, Illinois does not tax that. It's as good as making the conversion as a Florida tax resident.\n\nIn case anyone is about to start asking why I want to have everything in a Roth..I am a Roth maximalist. I'm not interested in having any money in a tax-deferred account at all, to the extent that congress does not pass a low blocking my ability to convert in the future. When I retire, I want the IRS to leave me alone, and the closest I can come to that is maxing out all my tax advantaged money into my Roth, and whatever I can't contribute, gets put into a taxable account with only qualified minimal annual dividends and shares sold at long term capital gains rates. I don't want to be forced to sell shares due to RMD's. That's just me.\n\nAlso, some people think you can only do one Roth conversion a year, but that is just if you have your investment company send you a check for the conversion. If you convert from one account direct to your Roth, you can do this as many times as you want to take advantage of market dips, thus lowering your conversion (confirmed by Vanguard, and my accountant).",
