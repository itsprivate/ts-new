He chose the most conservative allocation, so the advisor has divided the funds between bond and money market mutual funds.\n\nOver the past 2 years, the investment lost $10K and my relative is getting worried, even though the loss is not realized. I tried convincing my relative that it's easier to manage your own investments by following the Boglehead three-fund method or using a target date fund. You also don't have to pay fees to the financial advisor for basically achieving the same results. However, you would have to check your account and rebalance once in a while based on how close you are to retirement.\n\nMy relative argues that he doesn't know much about the market and he'd rather let a professional handle his money. He also hates the stock market and thinks its gambling. Do you have suggestions on what my relative should do, and how I can convince him that investing is not gambling?",
