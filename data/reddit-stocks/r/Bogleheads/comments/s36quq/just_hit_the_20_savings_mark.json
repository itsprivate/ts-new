But as my pay has crept up, we've kept our spending pretty flat, and I've allocated pay bumps to retirement savings. This month, my mortgage insurance expired, and that was another $200/month to put into retirement. It pushed me over that 20% mark and I feel pretty damn good. 20% used to feel like a very lofty goal.\n\nI also recently got over the $100K mark about a year ago and I'm at $140K now. It's not particularly impressive at my age (38) but it's accelerating and I finally feel really happy with the state of things. I was under the poverty line for a good chunk of my childhood and early adulthood, so I'm really looking forward to a retirement without money stress.\n\nThank you Bogleheads! Keep doing what you're doing and keep spreading the word.",
