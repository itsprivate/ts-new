I promised myself not to try buying the crazier, less valuable altcoins, and to stick to those 3 for a year. \n\nThis may go well, or not so well. It may also be decent. I’m curious, and I don’t mind losing the amount that I put in, and although I could have simply bought more index funds I must admit that my curiosity got the better of me.\n\nI will come back in a year in early September 2022 and link this post, and tell you guys how it went, in comparison to the index funds. \n\nTo be frank I predict that index funds will go better for me.
