I sold NVIDIA when I was 14 years old (2007 custodial account), I barely broke even during the 2020 crash, and my taxable account captured basically none of the 2021 bull run. I am thankful that my 401k doesn't (easily) allow me to mess things up on my own accord.\n\nI want to say one more thing - since 2019 I have read into a lot of strategies and tools - DCF and Buffett/Graham-style stock picking, sentiment analysis, technical analysis, order flow, I learned about macro trends and factors, bond markets, futures, options, it never really seems to end.\n\nNone of that really helped me much at all. None of it seemed to give me any real edge. I think most of that knowledge is absolutely useless for anyone that works 9-5, and simply doesn't have the bandwidth to ruminate over their equity positions day after day. My largest gain last year - by a giant, giant margin - were stupid options purchases around the time of the GME squeeze (BB, NOK, NAKD). Absolutely bone-headed decisions.\n\n*It pays a whole lot more to be lucky than smart, and you're probably not very lucky, or smarter than the hawks watching the markets every day.*\n\n**So here's what I do now:**\n\nI set up an M1 account with recurring deposits that align with my situation, income, and risk tolerance. I don't necessarily think you need to stick with M1, or Vanguard funds, but that is what works for me.\n\n-\t30% VOO (S&amp;P500)\n-\t20% VXF (ex-S&amp;P US fund)\n-\t20% VEA (ex-US developed markets)\n-\t10% VWO (ex-US emerging markets)\n-\t8% VIOV (small cap value)\n-\t5% BND (US bonds)\n-\t5% BNDX (ex-US bonds)\n-\t2% VBR (small-mid cap value, higher AUM)\n\nI like this setup because it fits with a lot of lazy portfolios, but allows me to have some control over geographic distribution and large/mid/small cap allocation. VT, or VTI/VXUS would probably work out just fine too.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps at least one person who is on the fence about moving from active to passive investing. It has helped my stress level and focus tremendously too. Life's too short to worry about the next CPI numbers or whatever.\n\nStay lazy!",
