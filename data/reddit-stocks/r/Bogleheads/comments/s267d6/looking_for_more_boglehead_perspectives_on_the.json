Recently I saw someone post about dividend ETFs and having dividend paying stocks in a small percentage of their tax advantaged account. Some Bogleheads refuted dividends are not free and this was for me a paradigm change. Someone posted a video of Ben Felix \"The Irrelevance of Dividends\" and it pretty much gave me clarity on how dividends work rather than just being \"income\". \n\nGiven that they are not free I'm trying to understand why people choose dividends. I choose to post it here rather than in u/dividends because although both subs will be biased toward their investment strategy I think Bogleheads might give some counter arguments, if any, for any time and place to have dividend stocks. Also, why do people swear by dividends in both taxable and tax advantaged as a retirement strategy for financial independence?\n\nI don't hold dividend portfolio nor I am looking for one.",
