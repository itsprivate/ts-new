That being said, I want to have a light hearted discussion on dividends, after yesterdays post saying dividends are meaningless. I watched the video, and I feel I grasp the core concept he was teaching, but still find myself disagreeing, even as an indexer. \n\nI want to throw my hat in the ring and say, “no, dividends aren’t meaningless, they have a place”. \n\nI want to start out by mentioning where I am in agreement. I believe the following are absolutely true:\n\n-\tChasing dividend yield is meaningless.\n-\tOnly buying a company (or paying a premium for a company) because they pay a dividend is meaningless\n-\tin many cases a business may be better served by not paying a dividend and reinvesting that capital back into the core business so that it can grow.\n-\tYes, dividends are a tax drag on a portfolio. Totally true. The video demonstrated this point super well.\n\n\nNow, hear my humble case for why dividends DO matter:\n\n-\tDividends provide people in retirement or close to retirement a mechanism to live off of income that has better tax treatment than ordinary income (qualified dividends)\n-\tDividends provide investors a mechanism to get a return on capital without selling shares or chipping away at their portfolio’s principle. This is especially important in retirement, where you don’t want to drain your fund any time you need money.\n-\tDividends can act as a stabilizing mechanism in down markets. Reliable companies will still pay their dividend even in a down market (dividend aristocrats), especially if nothing has changed about the underlying core business. This isn’t always the case, but is *often the case*.\n-\t“dividends decrease the stock price by the amount the dividend is paid”. I don’t think this is true. Mathematically plausible, sure. But the stock market is emotional. In the short term, meaning days or weeks, this will be true, you can expect share price to decrease by dividend payout. Because the ex dividend date payout is priced in. But the market is fickle, and more often than not those companies prices will jump right back to their price before, and continue to grow afterward. In this sense you get a return on capital in the form of a dividend, and get to leave your stock alone and let capital appreciation continue to do its thing over years to come without needing to sell shares.\n-\tThe point above is even more true when you look at companies with a high prospect of growth like Apple or Microsoft who aren’t dividend aristocrats. Their share price doesn’t correlate at all to their dividend payout. You just can’t count on a stocks price to go up or down relative to its dividend. \n\n\nI consider myself a Boglehead first and foremost, I wouldn’t call myself a dividend investor, or dividend growth investor or anything like that. But I absolutely love receiving my quarterly Vanguard dividends, reinvest them as soon as I can, and plan on using dividends as a form of income down the road when I’m closer to retirement or in retirement. I believe the dividend snowball is an absolutely real thing. \n\nDividends do matter. But chasing yield, and ONLY investing in a company for its dividend is a recipe for disaster. \n\nSo continue indexing, and gather those index’s dividend each quarter and watch that passive income grow. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\nEDIT: That being said, I’m still willing to hear why I might be wrong. I’m still in my investing learning journey.",
