Today in class he gave a lecture on personal finance and said some things that really did not sit right with me. In fact, I think he was 100% wrong about a few things and I wanted to see what you guys thought. Here are 4 of the points he made:\n\n1. **The only way to build wealth in the US is by owning real estate.**\n\nReally? Everything I have learned about personal finance tells me that housing is an EXPENSE, not and INVESTMENT. I understand that as you pay off your mortgage you will build equity, but I also know that mortgages are amortized, your utilities are higher, you have to pay for furniture, property taxes, repairs all out of pocket, not to mention all the extra cash you will need to keep on hand in your emergency fund for these kinds of home expenses, which is an opportunity cost in and of itself. And once you own your house outright, it is a very illiquid asset and other houses around you will have appreciated too, so you didn’t really get ahead.\n\n**2. Renting is just throwing money away.**\n\nCome on. Shelter is a necessary expense no matter how you look at it. I bought groceries earlier today to feed me and my wife. I will never see that money again. Is that “throwing money out the window” too?\n\n3. **You should put the smallest down payment on your home possible.**\n\nI thought 20% was recommended to avoid PMI? I think what my professor was going for was the ‘get into a house as early as possible to start building equity’ but still. It sounds like having a higher mortgage payment and paying more in interest over the long run is not worth the extra equity.\n\n**4. If your monthly mortgage payments aren’t painful and push your financial limits every month, you didn’t buy a big enough house.**\n\nThis one made me the most uncomfortable honestly. He claimed that after 2 or 3 years of owning the house you will look back and laugh at how you used to think your mortgage payments were expensive because you will likely get raises and be making more money in a few years. This seems like overconfidence and a quick way to lose your house in the event of job loss.\n\nThat was pretty much everything my professor said that bugged me. Of course, he did say some good things as well such as always save a portion of your income and always keep learning so you can increase your earning potential. I just felt like with the 4 points above he was steering everyone in our class WAY in the wrong direction and potentially leading people to make terrible financial decisions. I spend a lot of time on this sub and enjoy reading about personal finance, so I think I have a pretty good feel for what the general rules of thumb are when it comes to most financial decisions, but I wanted to see what you guys thought.\n\nAm I missing something or being over dramatic? My wife and I are newly married in our mid 20's and are basically planning to do the opposite of what my professor taught today lol. It would be pretty hard to convince me that living in a 1 bedroom apt with my wife and maxing our IRA’s and 401k’s isn’t better than buying as much house as you can finally stretch yourself to afford.",
