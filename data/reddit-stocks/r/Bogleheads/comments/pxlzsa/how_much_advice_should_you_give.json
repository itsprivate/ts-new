Recently I was in the barber shop and overheard one of the barbers and a client discussing the “inevitable” market crash to come and how they were moving all of their money to cash. \n\nIn another instance, my wife comes home one day last week and tells me that a mortgage broker, around 60 years of age, tells her that the market is about to crash and that she has moved to 100% bonds, and that we should too! We are in our early thirties. My wife asked me what I thought about that. My response was “whatever makes her sleep at night, but we aren’t doing that.”  \n\nAnd most recently, my own father, who is also around 60 years of age, tells me just yesterday that he is going to move his 401k into something safe because he feels the next 18 months could “get bad.” His 401k offers a virtually risk-free low yield money market fund. When he asked me what I thought about it, I again told him to do whatever makes him sleep at night, but that timing the market is rarely, if ever, successful. My strategy never changes. Each month I buy more of the same index funds, no matter what the market is doing. \n\nNow, I only offered my father this minimal advice because he asked my opinion, but the truth is I want to try to talk him out if it and tell him to instead focus on a comfortable allocation. I’d also like to tell him to ignore the noise, and enjoy the sale, if one were to arise. But I’m curious, what woul you do? I’m a firm believer that what a person does with their money is their business, but when it comes to loved ones, I’m inclined to try just a little harder.",
