I have 1 year emergency fund saved up for this case and am pretty confident if my current clients leave, I will be able to find a way to get new clients within 1 year...\nI have invested most of my savings after emergency fund into index fund, 70% in equity, 30% in debt.... I have never experienced volatility and I am worried about panicking and timing the market... I regularly get thoughts that markets are at all time high and I should wait before investing more into equity... My question is how can I stay the course and stop panicking especially when markets actually drops in future.... For people who are investing since a long time, how did you overcame this feeling?",
