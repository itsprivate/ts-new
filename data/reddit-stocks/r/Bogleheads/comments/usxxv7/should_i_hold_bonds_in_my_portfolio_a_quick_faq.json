Fixed income assets are important in a balanced portfolio. So OK, here goes:\n\n------------------\n\nQ: **Correlation Confusion:** *Aren't bonds supposed to go up when stocks go down? Is that dynamic broken?!*\n\nA: This is a common misunderstanding. Bonds do go up a lot of the time when stocks go down (particularly in steep crashes), but not always, like: when we have a combination of rising rates and higher inflation. I suspect, but we won't know until it happens, that if this bear market turns really ugly, Treasuries will start shooting up again.\n\n-------------------\n\nQ: **Selling Out:** *I have a plan that includes a target stock/bond allocation, but I am worried about the bond portion, which has been going down -- should I continue to buy and hold that despite the recent drops?*\n\nA: Keep holding bonds and stay the course. Make sure you have a glide path, too.  Imagine for a moment the alternatives: stocks are *not* a safe option to replace bonds, and cash has low yields well below the inflation rate. Plus, at least in my portfolio, stocks are down more than twice what my bonds are year-to-date. Bonds are doing OK.\n\n------------------\n\nQ: **Seeking Alternatives:** *But I bought bonds for stability, and now they're down -- and I get that fixed income is important -- so how about instead of bonds, I use cash, gold, real estate or something like that?*\n\nA: Bonds are down, but interest rates are up. In the long run, higher rates are a *good thing* -- bond NAV might drop for now, but that will benefit you oiver time. Now might even be a good time to shift from cash *to* bonds if you have been hesitant. 'Don't time the market' applies to both stocks and bonds. I saw a lot of people got out of bonds in favor of cash throughout the 2010s, and missed out on the tailwinds of a lowering-rate environment. Those various bond alternatives are mostly not very bond-like, anyway. They just won't work the same way.\n\n------------------\n\nQ: **Crystal Balls:** *OK, but, we know rates are going to go up ... right? Why not act on that in advance?*\n\nA: Nobody knows nothin' -- these policies shift with economic projections. We could easily see a return to stimulus if things get bad, which in turn could lower interest rates and boost bond fund NAV. Tune out the noise.\n\n-----------------------\nQ: **Which Bonds:** *Let's say I'm convinced -- what kinds of bonds do you hold and recommend.*\n\nI use 50/50 nominal/real bonds (e.g. TIPS and Treasuries, but also Series I and EE bonds). TIPS and I bonds help guard against inflation. Treasuries and EE bonds do well under deflation. Hedging both sides, as it were. If you don't want to get into anything too complicated, a simple, single-fund starting point would be Intermediate Treasuries.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n**Thank you for coming to my TED Talk on Fixed Income Allocations.**\n\n**TL;DR Bonds go down sometimes, though rarely by much, and that generally makes them a better deal.**\n\n***P.S.
