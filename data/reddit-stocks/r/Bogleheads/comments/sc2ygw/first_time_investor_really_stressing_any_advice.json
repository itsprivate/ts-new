Come from a really poor family and never had a chance to save at all since most of my paychecks would goto helping my family. I found a stable job and make a $44,000 before taxes, after taxes it ends up around $32,000.\n\nMy job offers 401k, but they don't match anything I put in. I decided to open a Vanguard Roth IRA. I don't know much about investing really but I just watched some youtube videos and checked some reddit forums and put my initial money into VTI since I couldn't afford VTSAX (3k being the minimum). \n\nI was wondering do I keep putting it into VTI until it equals to about 3k and move it into VTSAX?\n\nShould I keep VTI and add VXUS to the portfolio?\n\nShould I open a unmatched 401k anyways?\n\nLastly, if I was to put 500$ each month in, how do I split it up into VTI+VXUS money or % wise (eg. buy 2 shares of VTI and whatever left save it until I can get one VXUS)\n\nThanks in advance. Any advice is welcomed.",
