  "selftext": "There have been so many posts on this subreddit about people having trouble buying I-Bonds, whether due to [TreasuryDirect.gov](https://treasurydirect.gov/)'s horrible interface or the ridiculous requirement for many forms (including to add or edit bank information and sometimes to open an account) of a signature guarantee, which is in practice very difficult to find since many banks do not provide it.\n\nI am unfortunately having these issues. I changed my bank, but cannot add it to Treasury Direct because all of the banks around me have said that they will not provide a signature guarantee, even if it is explicitly not a medallion guarantee. While some TD forms now accept a notary public instead, FS 5512 is not one of them. I am still working to solve this, and if you have any advice I would appreciate it.\n\nIn the meantime, I have contacted my elected representatives and I encourage you to do so as well, whether you are currently struggling with Treasury Direct or have in the past. There are so many complaints about this on Reddit, but they aren't getting to the people who in theory could advocate directly to the Treasury Department. \n\n[Find you member of the House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and search their website for a place to contact them. You can either write them a message or you can look for case management help directly with a federal agency. Either way, make it known that this is an issue.\n\n[Contact your U.S. Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm) or both of them here, and do the same.\n\n[Contact the White House Office of Correspondence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/) and select \"help with a federal agency.\" They have hired people to actually go through these and help people. \n\nInflation is high right now and and it is perfectly valid to complain to your representatives that the interface/process to purchase government inflation protection bonds should not be this difficult to access.",
