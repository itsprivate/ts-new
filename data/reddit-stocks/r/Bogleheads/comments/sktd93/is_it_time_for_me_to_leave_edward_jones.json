In doing so, I now have 5 different accounts with them from taxable accounts to a few different IRAs (some IRAs were rolled over from previous job 401ks). \n\nAs I've gotten older I'm starting to appreciate the Bogle head investing approach.  I'm trying to find the best strategy for simplifying my diverse Edward Jones portfolio and focus it on just a few index funds (or at least simplify it much more than it is now).  \n\nI've mentioned I want to simplify my accounts to my Edward Jones guy and he is suggesting that I move a bunch of money into an American Balanced mutual fund like ABALX.  There appears to be a price break at $200k which I would qualify for and he feels it's a good \"park it and forget it\" place to put the money into.   I feel like I've brought up that I would like to focus on a few VT index funds a handful of times to him and every time I do I get a long winded answer with a lot of suggestions (like the American Fund) that he recommends instead.   \n\nI'm curious what this group would recommend as a good strategy for me to become more \"boglehead\" like with my portfolio at this stage in my life.  I've considered opening up a Fidelity account to roll over some of the accounts there into a few VT index funds, but I'm not sure if that's to brash or not as I know there will be fees involved with closing and selling the Edward Jones accounts and funds.  I'm also not sure if I should roll over a few accounts to Fidelity or move everything over, and curious to get other peoples perspective on it. \n\nHere's more info about my current portfolio with some % approximations: \n\n401k Owner-owned Account: MNY MKT FUND 2.5% / HARTFORD BALANCED INCOME HBLFX 22.71% / IVV ETF 37.5% / MDIZX 19.5% / MID CAP ETF IWR 17%\n\nTaxable Account:  BA stock / FUTY ETF / ERTH ETF / XLV SPDR / XBI SPDR / VT ETF\n\nTraditional IRA:  MFRS 1.5% / LUV Stock 1.19% / VPU ETF / Mutual Funds: AFMBX 12.42% / IVOSX 1.7% / FDTRX 17.43% / FSMLX 7.15% / HQIFX 18.55% / CPBFX 4.2% / SMEFX 6.47% / TSVQX 5.5% / PSTQX  / PEQKX 17% /\n\nTraditional IRA: KO Stock / EBAY Stock / PYPL Stock / Mutual Funds: ABALX / AMECX / AMRMX\n\nRoth: GOOG Stock / Mutual Funds: CVFCX / PEQIX / GLOSX / PIMAX",
