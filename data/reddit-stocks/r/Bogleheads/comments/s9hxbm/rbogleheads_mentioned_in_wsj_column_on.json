So he owes 23.8% in federal tax and 4.95% in Illinois state tax—all told, more than $150,000. “HOW,” he asked in capital letters, “COULD VANGUARD LET THIS HAPPEN??”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Sitting-Hawk,” who asked me not to disclose his real name, says he put about $1.9 million into the fund in a taxable account in 2015 after he maxed out contributions to his tax-deferred funds. He added more savings; by last year, he had about $3.6 million in taxable money in the fund.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“I didn’t want to be that guy who’s constantly trading,” he says. “I just wanted to set it and forget it and have some peace of mind instead of messing around with it every couple of days.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“It sucks that this had to happen,” he says.",
