  "selftext": "Hi, so my parents have had a financial advisor forever and last year I mentioned the option of doing index funds.  I got my parents bogle's books.  We've been reading them and they agreed it was a good idea.  The advisor buys and sells individual stocks causing large capital gains taxes every year.  If my parents had indexed, their capital gains taxes would be nowhere near what they are now because there would not be constant buying and selling.  The advisor obliged last year to move all sales of individual stocks when he would normally have a sale to VTI and the bonds to BND.  The issue now is that anytime we speak with him he keeps pointing out the successes he has with the individual stocks and the failures of VTI and BND under similar periods.  Truthfully, over the years in total he has not beaten the index.  But recently he keeps pointing to quarterly successes of certain stocks and recent failures of BND and VTI.  I think we are at a point where our investing style no longer matches the advisor and it's causing a conflict.  My parents still need a hand held even though they'd like to transition to indexing.  We would like to find an advisor that charges hourly rates instead of a percentage of assets to help us plan this out.  Is this something that is available or is there a website for such advisors and is there a way to find one that is completely in line with the boglehead train of thought?  Thanks in advance bogleheads!!",
