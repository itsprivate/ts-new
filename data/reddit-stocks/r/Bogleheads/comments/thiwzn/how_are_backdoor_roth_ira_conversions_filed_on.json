  "selftext": "Hello. The last few years I have had issues with tax preparers not understanding how to file Back-door Roth IRA conversions on my taxes as if it's some super rare thing. I'm worried they aren't filing them correctly cause I looked back at an old tax file and it showed something about excess contributions which is when you contribute when you're over the income limit I believe. I am looking for a new tax preparer this time and would like to know for my own sake what the correct forms are and everything. Also, my tax situation for last year was a little odd so I wanted to know how this situation would be filed:  \n\n\nJanuary 2021 - I contributed the $6k max to my Rollover IRA for the previous year (2020)\n\nJanuary 2021 - I converted the $6k to my Roth IRA (back-door method for 2020)\n\nFebruary 2021 - I contributed $6k DIRECTLY to my Roth cause I didn't expect to go over the income limit that year due to covid and a career change.\n\nMarch 2022 - Because I went over the income limit for 2021 I am re-characterizing my 2021 contribution as a Rollover IRA contribution. Once this change kicks in at Fidelity, I will then convert it to my Roth (back-door).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I understand correctly, for my 2021 taxes I will have to report the conversion for year 2020 since it happened in 2021. For 2022, the 2021 conversion will be reported. So which forms and sections of my tax file will I need to make sure my tax preparer is looking at so everything gets reported correctly?",
