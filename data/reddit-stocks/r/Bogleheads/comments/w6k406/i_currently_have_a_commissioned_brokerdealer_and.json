So far we've only setup a cashflow management account, I've paid off all my \"bad\" debt, and established a healthy emergency fund... now we are getting to the investment step. I'll start off by saying I like this guy. He does spend a fair bit of time with me when I request the time, and he has been really thorough as far as his \"advice\" goes. At the same time, I have been educating myself near nightly on personal finance and long term investing, and have been more and more attracted to the self-directed \"Boglehead\" approach.\n\nHe wants to put me in a fund, particularly Matson Money. With a &lt;$500k balance, the fees on this would be 1.37% (0.48 to Matson, 0.89 to him). Matson is highly diversified, rebalances quarterly, and claims to be extremely tax efficient. Going this route sounds like it's a very hands-off approach that I would be paying that 1.37% to not have to think about it, and get access to advice at no additional cost when I need it.\n\nBut I'm not a very hands-off kinda guy when it comes to my finance. I like this stuff, and I learn quick. That said I'm also running my own business, a husband, and a father of two. So I'm conflicted on whether I'm better off paying someone to keep tabs on my investments and provide me advice, or I should take up the Boglehead approach and manage it myself.\n\nThe advice in particular is I think what is giving me even a second thought, as a lot of the advice out there on the internet does seem to lean more in the direction of people who are employed, have access to employer matched 401(k)s, and are in tax brackets that are more middle of the road. Once all my factors are taken into account (self-employed, higher tax bracket, family, entrepreneurial, etc) some of this starts to stack up and I feel like I get a bit of decision paralysis.\n\nI know this is r/Bogleheads and I think I know where you guys stand on the binary decision of managed vs. self-directed, but I'm hoping there are some folks out there who might be in any kind of similar situation or gone through the same debate who could share their experience to help inform my own.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Wow! Thanks guys!! I had no idea the quality of advice I’d get from internet strangers. I did leave out what is appearing to be an important piece of data about how the fees change as AUM grows. Here is the full fee schedule:\n\n&lt;$500k = 1.37\n500-1M =1.23\n1M-3M = 1.13\n3M+ = 1.03",
