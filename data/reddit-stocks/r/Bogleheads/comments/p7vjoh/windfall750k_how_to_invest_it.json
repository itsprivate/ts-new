The rest of the settlement will be used for having money on hand, and for improvements on our home, and maybe a vacation after the pandemic calms down.\n\nJust some quick info about our situation.\n\nShe(52) has been declared disabled by the government and collects $1600 in SS and has Medicare. I(39) make around 40k a year, it varies, but has never been less than 35k, or more than 55k. We have one child(14) still living with us. We do not have much savings, a little under $10k in the bank. No 401k, IRA, etc. We only recently were able to start saving money, once my wife got early SS, and has Medicare now.\n\nWe have no debt outside of one car payment, and a mortgage. We are 8 years into our 3.5% mortgage($143k), it is 1000k a month. We have around 300-350k in equity in the house, we bought at the literal bottom in a beautiful area just outside a large city that is becoming more desired. The car payment is $640 a month, with around $13k left on it.\n\nI'm content with our current lifestyle. We'd like to do more vacations mostly.\n\nMy wife wants to get a financial planner, and her cousin thinks it's a good idea. Her cousin is a bank president, so she is definitely someone worth listening to on these issues I think. She's also the only person we've trusted to tell this to, she doesn't know the amount though(it's not worth the risk of us losing the settlement, I'll be deleting this throwaway quickly as well). However, I really don't think our amount of money is large enough to warrant a financial planner.\n\nMy wife also thinks paying off our house would be good. I think that our interest rate is quite low, and we can probably put that $140K to better use earning more than 3.5%. The piece of mind of no mortgage is very powerful though I have to admit. I'd love advice on that idea.\n\nI have no desire to try and beat the market or do the necessary DD to even attempt it. Capitalism requires growth in the long term, or it dies. I will just go with that iron law and profit alongside it, index funds capture that reality perfectly it seems. We don't want to touch the money until our son graduates in 4 years, and then we only want to pull out a little bit. Maybe 3-4% a year to supplement our lifestyle. We'd like to leave our children with money when we die(which hopefully is way out in the future)\n\nI'd like to retire early as well, but I'm not sure when that would be feasible. My wife and I are totally fine with pretending this money is just money we wisely saved over the last 20 years, and letting interest do what interest does going forward.\n\nWith that said, I'm thinking it's probably best to just do a lazy two funds portfolio, with something like VT, and BNDW at a 70-30 split respectively. \n\nI'd love any input/advice you all have.\n\nThank you!",
