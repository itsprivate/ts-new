  "selftext": "(TL:DR at the bottom)\n\nThere has been a little debate here lately on whether the time spent using VTI/VXUS to buy the whole world market is worth it when you could save yourself a lot of time and trouble by just using VTWAX and be done with it. I did a little math here to help people decide for themselves. I’m comparing VTI/VXUS against VTWAX (and not VT), because if your goal is truly is to do as little work as possible and forget about a few measly basis points, VTWAX represents keeping it simple in its purest form. If you can set up an auto deposit every month, you have literally zero work to do with VTWAX. \n\nHowever, if you want to do a little more work every month, the performance of VTWAX can be replicated exactly by looking up VTWAX’s portfolio every month and seeing how much of their equities are US based vs. foreign based and buying the ETFs (VTI/VXUS) in the same proportions. (For the record, once you understand how to do all this, it should take you less than 15 minutes per month--it takes me closer to 10.)\n\nThe question I'm trying to answer is this: **Is that 15 minutes worth it?**\n\nI’m trying to keep the math as simple as possible without it being so simplistic that it’s meaningless. I have left out a lot of details (taxes on dividends, foreign tax credits, retirement accountants vs brokerages, ect.). If there is a consensus in the comments that suggests that my parameters are way off or if you think I’ve left out parameters that would SIGNIFICANTLY skew the results one way or the other, I’ll try to redo the math.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\nYour Initial Investment: $3000\n\nYour monthly contributions: $500\n\nYears you plan to invest: 30 years\n\nVTWAX’s expense ratio: 0.1%\n\nVTI’s expense ratio:  0.03%\n\nVXUS’s expense ratio: 0.1%\n\nTotal expense ratio when you average 58% VTI and 42% VXUS: 0.051%\n\nBallpark Annual expected return on VTWAX: 7%\n\nBallpark Annual expected return on VTI/VXUS split: 7.051%\n\nMinutes it takes you to invest in VTWAX every month: 0\n\nMinutes it takes you to invest in VTI/VXUS every month: 15\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing the simple Future Value function in Google sheets, the final balance of each account **after 30 years** are as follows:\n\n**VTWAX: $634,334.99**\n\n**VTI/VXUS: $640,753.06**\n\nOver 30 years, those measly 5 basis points have earned you an additional $6,547.19. Now, here comes the important question: was that extra 15 minute you spent every month to earn that $6,547.19 worth it?\n\nOver the course of those 30 years, those 15 minute chucks mean that you spent 90 hours working to earn $6,418.07. And that comes out to an hourly rate of $72.75.\n\n**TL:DR:** According to my very, very rough calculations, if you chose to spend 15 minutes every month looking up VT’s portfolio balance and then buying the ETFs in those proportions instead using VTWAX, you are basically choosing to take a job that will take you 90 hours to finish and will pay you $72.75 per hour.\n\nI’m willing to take that job. Therefore, I’m taking the VTI/VXUS route.",
