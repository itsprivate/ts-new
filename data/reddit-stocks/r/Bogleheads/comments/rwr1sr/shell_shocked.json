It was my first year investing and my portfolio looked like something straight out of a wsb thread. In fact our only gains came from my wife's 401k employer plan (2055 tdf).\n\nSo far I've converted my sep ira and her Roth holdings to a mix of vtsax &amp; vtiax and our taxable into vti (no bonds as of now besides her 401k allocation). Im a little shell shocked from last year so while I maxed out 2022 contributions already I'm dca weekly.\n\nIs this a sound plan or should I just bite the bullet and stop the dca and lump sum into the funds? Im not trying to intentionally time the market but it just doesn't sit well with me to not dca after losing so much last year. By December we'll have our 2022 contributions fully invested and I realize I may loose out on some gains if we have another good year. Any insight is appreciated!",
