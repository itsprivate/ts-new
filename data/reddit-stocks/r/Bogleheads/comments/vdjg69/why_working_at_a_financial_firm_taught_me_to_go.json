Learned a lot there, but the biggest thing I will always remember is that I should never try to go up against those firms. Unless you have inside information, you will NEVER have as much information at your fingertips as they do. When I left, this place had quite a bit, beyond the obvious large number of traders:\n\n* A five digit number of servers, many of which are constantly ingesting market data and determining where opportunities can be found\n\n* Hundreds of developers and other technologists, whose job is to create programs to understand the market data feeds and present the best opportunities for traders as well as instant evaluations for things like risk. When I say instant, I mean their processing time was measured in microseconds when I started there and nanoseconds when I left. \n\n* Multiple research teams who would be diving deep into SEC filings and reviewing other news for quick analysis of what that meant for that company and how other companies would be affected\n\n* Dozens of quantitative analysts (\"quants\"), most of whom had PhDs and would be developing trading models in tandem with the traders at the firm\n\nIn short, if you think you've got a soon-to-be \"hot stock\" that nobody knows about yet, odds are others not only do, they've evaluated it and determined the risk/reward ratio is not optimal. You may get lucky, but odds are you will lose out more often than you will win.\n\nThis is why I just do the 3 fund approach with a \"set it and forget it\" mentality.
