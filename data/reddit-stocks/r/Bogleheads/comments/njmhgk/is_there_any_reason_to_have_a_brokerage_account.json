My Roth IRA at Vanguard is currently 100% VTWAX, but I noticed that Fidelity allows you to purchase for example VT with a 0.08% ER instead of VTWAX’s ER of 0.10% with fractional shares, which is the whole point of VTWAX. Not to mention if you like VTSAX + VTIAX instead, not only does it seem you can do it with VTI and VXUS for lower expense ratios at Fidelity, but all of their own funds like FSKAX and FTIHX which are the Fidelity counterparts to VTSAX and VTIAX have no minimums! Plus Fidelity seems to have access to HSAs, and things like supposedly greater customer support, friendlier UI/UX designs, and more…. My question is is there any reason not to just transfer everything back to Fidelity? Is there some secret fee that I’m missing? Or is it just that people believe Vanguard accounts are safer? Especially since vanguard doesn’t even have a mutual fund version of BNDW for bonds so you can only take advantage of the etf as a mutual fund via fractional shares at Fidelity. Would it make more sense to just have everything at Fidelity? Whether it’d be to hold VT+BNDW or something like FSKAX/FTIHX/FXNAX as a “mega cheap” 3-fund portfolio? Thanks, I’m actually super eager as to hear why there is merit to staying with Vanguard accounts and not just using their ETFs at a firm like Fidelity.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
