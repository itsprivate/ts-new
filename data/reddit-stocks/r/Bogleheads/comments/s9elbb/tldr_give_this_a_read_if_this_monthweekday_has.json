Yes, there will be a crash sometime in the future. No, we don't know  when it will happen, not even if you are Michael Burry, so shut up and  stick to your investment policy statement, or make one if you don't have  one. \n\nIn the meantime, ditch the speculative crap: penny stocks,  meme stocks, weekly options, and stop overweighting large cap tech  growth stocks (especially ARKK). Buy a US total market fund, a developed  markets fund, an emerging markets fund, and a US total bond fund  according to their world market cap weights and call it a day. Bonus  points if you have the guts to stick to a small-cap value tilt despite  large-cap growth outperforming for the last 10 years. \n\nDon't buy  on margin, try crypto, use leveraged change traded products, short  volatility, or trade derivatives unless you absolutely understand why  you need to and what these products/strategies could do in terms of  risk. Keep your costs low and portfolio assets simple. Don't overtinker  or overfit based on backtests, you're just driving using the rearview  mirror here. There really is no free lunch outside of diversification  across asset classes/geographies/factors.\n\nDon't mess around  trying to predict and overweight sectors you think will outperform.  Chances are you don't know anything the market hasn't priced in already.  Your \"sure thing\" stock pick built on FOMO and optimism/confirmation  bias will probably get smoked on a risk adjusted and absolute return  basis by some boomer holding a Vanguard index fund over 10 years. Mean  reversion is a very real phenomenon and will cause you to miss out on  future gains if you exhibit recency bias with your investments and chase  performance.\n\nSo, stick to your targeted asset allocation and  rebalance mechanically and coldly on the first trading day of each  quarter, bi-annually, or annually. Don't hold cash (unless it's a 6  month separate emergency fund in a HISA) as \"dry powder\" to \"buy the  dip\". You're not Warren Buffet and your Roth IRA isn't Berkshire. Invest  often and consistently, regardless of how the market is doing. Timing  the market never works. So stop goddamn trying and just set up auto  deposits and dividend reinvestment already!\n\n If all else fails and you're on the verge of panic selling or changing  strategies, delete your brokerage app and turn off the news, price  alerts, and get off social media. Ignore the market noise. Go outside or  have a pint at the local bar. Spend time with your parents. Hang out  with friends. Take your significant other on a date. Partake in your  hobby. Watch a sports game. Travel the world. Enjoy life.  \n\n\\*Not financial advice, I'm just an ape with diamond hands 💎🤲\\*",
