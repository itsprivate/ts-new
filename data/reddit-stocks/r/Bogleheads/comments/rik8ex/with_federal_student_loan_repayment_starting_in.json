Well, D-Day (01/31/2022) is fast approaching and nothing is happening, so it's about go-time to make a decision. Do I just pay these off and move on with life or refinance, max 2021/2022 Roths for both wife and me, max Solo 401k at beginning of 2022, etc?\n\n**Background**: Wife and I (both 34 years old, with two kids) had approximately $220k in student loan debt when we started dated in 2014. Hers were private loans so we paid them off first ($70k). I paid mine down to $104k and then the pandemic happened, freezing all federal student loan payments. Since then I have been hoarding cash to pay them off.\n\n**Loan Info**: All federal loans with an average interest rate of 6.1%. I can refinance to approximately 2.5% and a lot of these refinance companies are offering a $1,000 refinance bonus, rendering the effective interest rate even lower.\n\n**Basic Net Worth Numbers**\n\n* Cash: $141k\n* Retirement Accounts: $286k (all invested in index funds)\n* Home Value (Zillow Estimate): $365k\n* Mortgage: $240k\n* Student Loan Debt: $104k\n* No Credit Card Debt\n* No Car Loans\n* Net Worth: $448k\n\n**Income**\n\n* Wife: $40k/year\n   * Has 401k (will max next year)\n   * Works PT\n* Me (City Government): $68k\n   * Includes 457 Deferred Comp plan (which I max and can contribute to in addition to 401k)\n   * Includes State Pension valued at roughly $16k in contributions/year\n* Me (Solo Law Practice on Side): $75k\n   * $30,000 W2 Employee Salary\n   * $45,000 Distribution\n\n**Monthly Cash Flow**\n\n* Income: $13,333\n* Retirement Contributions: $5,125\n* Monthly Expenses: $6,000\n* *Plenty Left Over to Pay for Student Loan Payment*\n\n**Possible Retirement Buckets**\n\n* My 2021 Roth IRA ($6,000)\n* Wife 2021 Roth IRA ($6,000)\n* My 2022 Roth IRA ($6,000)\n* Wife 2021 Roth IRA ($6,000)\n* My Solo 401k for 2021: $27,000\n   * Contributed to 457 at government but none at solo practice yet\n   * Amount includes $19,500 EE match and $7,500 ER match\n* My Solo 401k for 2022: $28,000\n   * Amount includes $20,500 EE match and $7,500 ER match\n\n**Issue**: Basically I find myself paralyzed by choice. I've been working to pay off my student loans my entire professional career, but I don't think I ever could have imagined in 2014 that you could refinance these loans for 2.50%. \n\n**Options**\n\n1. *Pay Off Loans*. I can pay off the student loans and just be done with them, but parting with this much cash feels off with interest rates so low. \n2. *Invest Maximum*. I can do a hybrid where I pay off down to $50k, refinance the rest, and invest in tax-advantaged accounts. \n3. *Hybrid*. I can invest as much as possible, refinance at these ridiculously low rates, and pay them off over 5-10 years.\n4. *What About I Bonds?* I can also theoretically do $30k of I-Bonds for 2021, 2022, and 2023, for a total of $90k, and come out ahead of my student loan refinance rate. Is the hassle worth it?\n\nAny thoughts?",
