It can be accessed here: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=2900447](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447) \n\nIn the paper he concludes that from 1926-2016:\n\n1. just 42.6% of common stocks have a buy-and-hold return (inclusive of reinvested dividends) that exceeds the return to holding one-month Treasury bills over the matched horizon. \n\n2. More than half of common stocks deliver negative lifetime returns. \n\n3. The single most frequent outcome observed for individual common stocks over their full lifetimes   \nis a loss of 100%. \n\nLater on most notably he states that: \n\n\"just five firms (Exxon Mobile, Apple, Microsoft, General Electric, and International Business Machines) account for 10% of the total wealth creation. The 90 top- performing companies, slightly more than one-third of 1% of the companies that have listed common stock, collectively account for over half of the wealth creation. The 1,092 top- performing companies, slightly more than 4% of the total, account for all of the net wealth creation (returns in excess of one-month t-bills). That is, the remaining 96% of companies whose common stock has appeared in the CRSP data collectively generate lifetime dollar gains that matched gains on one-month Treasury bills.\" \n\nThis is fascinating data, however I have one question. \n\nHow is it that 42.6% of common stocks can have a buy-and-hold return that exceeds the return to holding one-month Treasury bills, even though the author states that only 4% of stocks are responsible for wealth creation (returns in excess of one month t-bills)? Wouldn't that mean 96% underperformed t-bills? So why does the author state that 42.6% of stocks outperformed?  \n\nIf anyone could shed some light of this that would be great.",
