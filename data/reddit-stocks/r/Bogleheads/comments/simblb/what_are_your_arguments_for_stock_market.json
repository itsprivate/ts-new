I have no private pensions or anything like that and the older I get the more I'm realising I have to put some sort of plan into place. A state pension (UK) would be a very very small fund for the lifestyle I want to retire at (£180/week, so around 240$/week).\n\nThey both have their own risks, of course. However they're both valuable investments in my eyes. I bought a bungalow for £90,000, ripped it apart and made everything new. I did almost all of the work myself to minimise costs. It was valued at £120,000 after the work. I rent it out for £400/week, with something like £100-150 profit. It's value is obviously growing quickly due to the housing market as well atm but I don't plan on selling for a few decades.\n\nMy point being, if I worked my way to having 5-10 properties before I retire, I have the rental income and also the value of the properties themselves too.\n\nMaybe I could do a bit of stock market and property simultaneously, but I wondered if any of you had considered properties as a means of retiring? \n\nCould I not use property as collateral on loans to invest in the stock market or is this a recipe for disaster? Obviously I'd have to check interest costs of the loan and compare to potential returns. Either that or I use them as leverage to get more properties. I don't know, looking for input from knowledgeable bogleheads.\n\nThanks for reading\n\nEdit: wording",
