Started applying the Boglehead philosophy last year after receiving a low six-figure inheritance on top of experiencing a change in jobs that more readily allowed me to put money away for retirement. That's later in life than I would have ideally liked to have begun this journey, but based on my investment plan over a 30-year horizon and what I'm regularly able to put away now thanks to my current job, I know I'll be fine. This post isn't about that though.\n\nIn my mid-20s, I didn't know anything about investing, and didn't have any genuine interest in learning about smart ways of putting away money. I was great at putting booze away though for nearly a decade.\n\nI wanted a way to view the costs of my drinking history in a way that concretely measured the damage I have done, and I realized that the Boglehead approach could actually be used to that effect. I'm sure it's telling that I was able to start my journey as a Boglehead sooner than I was able to quit drinking, but after this little exercise, I am absolutely done with drinking.\n\nI decided to ask myself a question that I knew, in advance, was going to be unsettling once I knew the answer, but I believe that facing up to it constitutes genuine accountability: **What if I had taken all the money I was spending on booze over a decade and invested it instead?**\n\nFor approximately 10 years before this point, I was spending approximately $400 a month on booze. It was mostly spent on cheap rum to mix with cokes on a near daily basis, and I had occasional glasses of wine or beers over the weekends *on top of that.*\n\nSo with that number in mind, let's get to it.\n\n**Q1: How much would $400 invested every month for 10 years be worth now if it were instead put into an investment vehicle with an assumed annual return rate of 7%?**\n\nFor my calculations, I'll be using [this calculator.](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html) I don't want to quibble much over the selected annual return rate, but I'll be using 7% in all my calculations. And these are idealized calculations in the sense that we obviously don't know what the exact behavior of the stock market is going to be any timeframe.\n\nEntering a starting amount of $0, with $400 invested at the end of each month for 10 years, the total value of my contributions and interest:\n\n**$68,420.69**\n\nOkay, so that's $68,420.69 I would have had today. Knowing that obviously sucks. But if you fully appreciate the value of compound interest, you know that this is only just the beginning.\n\nLet's say I correct the behavior and I put my future sums of $400 a month that I would have spent on alcohol instead into investments though that appreciate at the same annual return rate.\n\n**Q2: Assuming I now redirect money I would have otherwise spent on booze to investing in an investment vehicle with a 7% annual return rate, how much will money will be that worth in 30 years?**\n\nI enter a starting value of $0 with $400 invested at the end of each month for 30 years with the same annual return rate. The value of my contributions + interest generated after that time:\n\n**$467,781.04**\n\nThis is the money I am going to have when I instead invest what I otherwise would have pissed away on alcohol. But this still is not anywhere close to being the most important takeaway. \n\nIf you don't already fully appreciate the value of compound interest, this next question will cement it.\n\n**Q3: Let's assume I did have that $68,420.69 to invest right now and I invest it for 30 years, but I contribute *absolutely nothing* extra in monthly contributions. I just let it compound. How much then is this worth in 30 years assuming an annual return rate of 7%?**\n\nI enter a starting value of $68,420.69, the 7% return rate, 30 years, and $0 as the amount I'd contribute at the end of each month. The total after this period:\n\n**$520,835.74**\n\nIn other words, letting the original $68,420.69 just compound for 30 years with no additional contributions yielded more money alone than putting away $400 each month for 30 years. \n\nAnd that is why compound interest is the Boglehead's best friend.\n\nLet me restate what this all means: I spent $400 a month on booze over 10 years. If I had instead invested this money in assets with an annual return rate of 7% in those 10 years, that's $68,420.69 (Q1). Letting that sum just compound for an additional 30 years would result in $520,835.74 (Q3). But adding in $400 monthly contributions over those same 30 years would have yielded an extra $467,781.04 (Q2)\n\nIn other words, if all along I was investing $400 a month across 40 years, **that's close to 1 million dollars.** But because of how I pissed this money away on booze for the first 10 years, I'll be out $520,835.74 after all 40 years.\n\nAnd now that I have seen this number, I know I can never drink again. Because this is a number I am going to remember for the rest of my life.\n\nThank you for reading. Hoping this provides perspective to anyone who might need it. And if this makes you feel better about your own choices, I'm honestly okay with that.",
