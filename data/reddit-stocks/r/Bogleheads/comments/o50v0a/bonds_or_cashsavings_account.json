A savings account in 2001 might have had decent interest rate and putting the money there would have had better returns with similar/better safety net. \n\nAlso bond funds sometimes seem go below the principal amount too in a span of 5-10 years and it can result in negative equity if someone needs money within that timeframe. Being in savings account also avoids that.\n\nFor instance in 2012, price per share for VBTLX was 11.17 and in 2018 it dropped to 10.38.. this is without any major market crash (like 2008 recession or 2020 pandemic)/correction. Someone in 55 who invested 50% of their portfolio in bonds and planning to take some money at 60 would not even get back their principal amount in this case.\n\nEven today the price per share is similar or little to what it was 10 years ago which means there is nil returns.. someone planning to retire in 60 and changed their portfolio to include more bond allocation at 50 would be at loss this way isn't it. Wouldn't it better to keep cash or in savings account here?\n\nAm I missing something here with this approach?",
