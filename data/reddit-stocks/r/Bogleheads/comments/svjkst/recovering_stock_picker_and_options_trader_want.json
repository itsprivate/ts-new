  "selftext": "I figured this was the best subreddit to share. Part of this is to internalize the shift I've been doing, part of this is in case this can be helpful for some. This will be long.\n\nI should preface by saying that I have not lost money since I started (in 2015), and some of my accounts have even beat the market (ironically, it was the ones that I mostly bought solid stocks and forgot about it). That being said, my main account has underperformed the market. 2020 was for a time the salvation I needed, as my annual return was north of 50%, but then 2021 (and my emotions) got in the way, and my CAGR for both years dropped to about 15%. Pretty bad. **All in all, between all my accounts, my CAGR is only a few % points lower than the market.** So really, not a bad place to be. As for options trade, I've made 3-4% since 2020, but this was on margin, so it's kind of like gravy (although not worth the stress).\n\nWhy have I always been so gung-ho about stock picking, even though YoY I kept underperforming the benchmark? I'd say two main reasons:\n\n1) My (unjustified) belief that I was smarter than the market, smarter than fund managers, and smarter than analysts, despite doing this very \"part-time\". No, I didn't invest in meme stocks.\n\n2) My **very** unhealthy relationship with money. I have money anxiety whereas I always feel like I do not have enough savings, I'm not \"ahead enough\" in life, my peers are much better off than me, etc. Some of it is justified, some of it isn't. My wife and I are in our early 30's, combined we make north of $200k, so obviously, a good place to be. But we live in Toronto, bought our \"starter\" condo in 2020 for a whopping $600k. We are expecting our first child, and daycare alone will be 20% of our disposable income (daycare is about $2k a month in Toronto), daycare + mortgage/taxes/fees are 50% of our income. So all of a sudden, $200k doesn't feel that great... And I'm seeing townhouses left, right, and center selling for $1.5M and above, which makes me think we will never be able to upgrade and stay in this city. This has definitely not helped my money anxiety.\n\n**Enter stock picking and options trading.** Holy shit, this has made my anxiety 10x worse. 2020 was fine, but in 2021 when my wife and I started trying to have our kid (now 3.5 month pregnant), this is where money anxiety kicked in overdrive. And stock picking/options trading was taking a physical toll on me. I had many nights where I was only able to fall asleep at 2-3am because I was so stressed, nervous and physically unwell from it. It was bad. Then January happened, and this triggered me to say enough is enough. I had already begun unwinding a lot of my individual positions towards ETFs, but had not done so fully. When markets started freefalling, this is when I decided to shift everything to passive ETFs. I did so in about mid-January, so saved myself from a significantly larger drop had I stayed in many of my individual positions.\n\nI was able to convince myself that passive investing was the way to go by building a very detailed financial plan and forecast for the next 24 years (when we would be ready to retire, at 58 years old). I did this for all my (and my wife's) accounts, as well as our pension plans:\n\n1. I figured out what was the historical CAGR of the various index funds we invested in (I.e.: XEQT), the CAGR of the mutual funds we are invested in through our pension plans (ETFs are unfortunately not available). I then applied a very conservative modifier to assume going forward, the CAGR would be 65% of that. I wanted to have a very conservative estimate. I am using 7.97% CAGR for our employer-sponsored pension plan, and 6.70% for our passive investments.\n2. Right now we are 100% equity. I assumed a shift to bonds at 45 years old (80/20), and a further switch at 55 years old (60/40), and accordingly reduced the CAGR by 0.50% per shift. \n3. I mapped out or yearly salary with modest raises and promotions every five years, to figure out how much we would contribute every year to both our pensions and our various retirement funds. From there, I mapped out yearly contributions (and accounted for one year of parental leave and 4 years of daycare). The goal is 10% savings (of gross income) from year 0 to 5, and then go back to 20% once our kid will be in school. This target obviously accounts our contribution to our pension plans, but excludes employer matching.\n4. I reduced the PV of all our accounts by 30%, because again I wanted to be conservative and assume we are about to enter a bear market and that I am doing the switch at **the worse possible time.**\n5. From there, I calculated the FV of all our retirement accounts. I came to approximately $4.135M. I used a retirement yield of 4.25%, and calculated our payout in two ways: (1) assuming we do not touch the principal at all (live solely off the 4.25% yield), or assuming over 30 years (bringing us to 88 years old) we draw 50% of our principal, bringing it down to $2M. The former gives us, after tax, $15.7k per month. The latter gives us, after tax, $22.1k per month.\n6. I calculated how much we need for retirement, based on our current lifestyle, and assuming 2% inflation per year, on average (lol). $10k per month is what we truly need to keep our lifestyle the same ($6.5k in today's money), $15k per month to \"level up\" our lifestyle ($9.5k in today's money)\n\nDoing this thorough exercise has really helped me get over some of my money anxiety, and (1) realize that I do not need to penny pinch everything, as long as I stick to my savings plan; and (2) I really do not need to beat the market (which I never did in the first place) to have a very comfortable retirement. Shifting to a full passive investment has definitely helped reduce my anxiety so far, but it's also a work-in-progress. Next step is to not look at the markets every single day. \n\n**tl;dr:** I suffer from money anxiety, I also realized I can't beat the market, made a detailed financial plan, began investing passively and already this has been helpful in reducing my anxiety",
