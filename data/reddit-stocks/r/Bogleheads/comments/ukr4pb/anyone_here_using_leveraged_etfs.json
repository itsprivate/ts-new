Yes, drawdowns would be magnified in a bear market, but the 40% TYD would prevent any risk of getting wiped out. I mean...if intermediate treasuries drop 33% in a day, we've got bigger problems than our portfolios. Rebalancing quarterly (or even monthly, due to the bigger moves up/down your leveraged portfolio would be making) would ensure you're buying more UPRO if the market has been trending down.\n\nThe expense ratios for UPRO and TYD are depressing, but again....is a 1% expense ratio an acceptable tradeoff for 2-2.5x CAGR over the next 20 years?\n\nBacktesting with these specific funds doesn't capture the 2008 crash, but the biggest drawdown since 2011 would have been 34%, which I personally find to be an acceptable risk and trade-off for a CAGR of over 24%. Ironically, that 34% drawdown is this year.\n\n[Backtest 2011-Present](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2022&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=3&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;leverageType=0&amp;leverageRatio=0.0&amp;debtAmount=0&amp;debtInterest=0.0&amp;maintenanceMargin=25.0&amp;leveragedBenchmark=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VOO&amp;allocation1_1=60&amp;symbol2=VGIT&amp;allocation2_1=40&amp;symbol3=UPRO&amp;allocation3_2=60&amp;symbol4=TYD&amp;allocation4_2=40)\n\nIf one were to enter this strategy at the present time, it seems the biggest risk would be if bonds continue to move down with equities for an extended period of time moving forward. Again, this goes more towards risk tolerance and the ability to see your portfolio possibly draw down &gt;50% in a really bad year (and 2022 seems to be vying for that title).",
