I know I have money that I want to put into 3 funds. I'm 37 and own a business, my money is just in my bank account. I don't have or even know what the following are: 401K, Roth IRA. I've never owned a stock and I don't have an account with anybody except Bank of America checking/credit card/savings. I'm sure I'm supposed to know some of this stuff given my age and that I own a business, but I just don't.\n\nI'm a little embarrassed to be asking this here but how do you get started? I don't mean which 3 funds to choose (I feel like I'm on the step before this step), but like do I just go make an account on [Vanguard.com](https://Vanguard.com)? I see Vanguard talked about the most. And then when I have the account do I just search for the things like VOO/VTI and buy them? I see stuff about fees and taxes. I just want to park my money somewhere and not worry about it. I follow a few different investing subs and it seems like more often than not the things from this sub get mentioned over there.\n\nThe wiki says that a 3 fun portfolio is VTI, VXUS, and BND. So my plan is to do that. I just feel like I'm missing the step that's before actually having that. I don't have debt or any major bills. Not married and no kids. I don't plan on touching the money for the foreseeable future, I just want to participate in my money making money. I think I'm rambling at this point but any help would be appreciated! Thank you.",
