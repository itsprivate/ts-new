I'm trying to stage it so that they can't lock me out of my money, and give myself enough time to ensure I've saved all my financial documents from the last 4 years. The first leg of my succession plan is moving my individual stocks and 2 (of 6) mutual funds that will transfer in-kind over to Etrade. This will leave me in 4 shit funds that only EJ offers. I'm undecided how I'll approach these but fortunately there's not a ton of money in there. However, one of the dumber things I did was allowing them to convince me to transfer an old retirement account at Putnam/Empowerment over to them. This account was doing VERY well and I have little doubt it would have outperformed the shitty one they created for me. I did notice, however, that my IRA with EJ is in 7 funds all from Mass Financial (MFA). I think I red somewhere this is a massive red flag? This must be kickback city. Once I safely get my money out and get my funds converted over to low-fee, no load ETF/Index funds I will join the boglehead nation and helping prevent others from making this mistake. I am reading the message board over at [bogleheads.org](https://bogleheads.org) and I could've written some of these posts from others with similar experiences. While they made me money over time, they definitely siphoned off chunks here and there. I'm free soon and I'll put this experience behind as lesson learned.\n\nCan someone with more knowledge explain why they'd want me in so many funds all from the same vendor? I can understand the company would probably provide kickbacks, but why so many funds? And why is this so terrible? I really am curious. My current Fidelity 401k that I control is in 2 funds! And it's blowing away my EJ one in performance.",
