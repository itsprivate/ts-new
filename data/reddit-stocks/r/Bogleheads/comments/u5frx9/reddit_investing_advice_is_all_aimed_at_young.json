  "selftext": "\"Time in the market beats timing the market\" is the classic advice given to everyone who asks anything indicating that they are trying to figure out where the market might go in the future. The thing about this quote is that it's flawlessly good advice... for young people.\n\nThe problem is that the older you are, the less time you have in the market, and so the less the advice applies. Imagine a 90 year old being given this advice, how would it be of any use to them? \"Don't worry great grandpa, in 20 years it will all even out!\"\n\n\"Dude, just put in x% of your income every year and don't worry about it, it will all be fine in 30 years\" is well and good when you're 25 or 35, but what if you're 65, or 75?\n\nPeople who are near retirement or in retirement don't have all that much time in the market. They don't have anything new to put in, but (hopefully) they have a bunch of wealth that they have to figure out what to do with. Do they want to sit there with $500,000 worth of stocks which might possibly become $400,000 worth of stocks and then go nowhere for 10 years, as they then pull money out of it and it shrinks more each year?\n\nEveryone, if they live long enough and manage to save, will eventually reach the point where \"time in the market\" isn't on their side any more, and they will have to figure out how to time the market. They will have to figure out if they want to buy into or hold in their current market, and whether this makes sense given the current conditions.\n\nSo \"time in the market beats timing the market\" is not the ultimate pinnacle of investing wisdom. Everyone will (hopefully) live long enough to see it become useless advice. And then they'll have to make real decisions as to where to put their money.",
