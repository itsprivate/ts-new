So this is to help her preserve her wealth for as long as she&#39;s able too. She also has me, her son. But I&#39;m at a lost on how to suggest to build her portfolio. I almost feel like I should just make an appointment with a Fidelity office.   </p>\n\n<p>But, if anyone here has any advice, I would appreciate the help! Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
