These are book summaries I posted and went through and got all the parts about foreign equities and put them under one post.  These are just the summaries of the books I read, there is much more detail in the books than I am posting here.  I am currently overbalanced toward foreign.  \n\nAll About Asset Allocation\n\n-\tForeign stocks are great for US investors\n  - They do not always move in correlation with the US market\n  - They trade in foreign currency which is another diversifier\n-\tRebalancing only works if the investments in the portfolio don&amp;#39;t act the same way. You want assets that don&amp;#39;t correlate with each other\n-\tIf 2 investments move in the same direction at the same time, they have positive correlation. If they move in opposite directions, they have negative correlation.\n-\tYou want investments that have lower correlation to each other\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t purchase new investments that have a high positive correlation with investments you already have\n-\tNegative correlation is theoretically ideal when selecting investments but this doesn&amp;#39;t occur in the real world. Typically, the best asset pairs you will find are noncorrelated\n  - Correlation is measured on a -1 to +1 scale\n    - +0.3 or greater is positive\n    - -0.3 or less is negative\n    - -0.3 to 0.3 is noncorrelated\n-\tCorrelations are dynamic, not static. And you can&amp;#39;t guess when/how they will change. For example – The S+P 500 and Intermediate term treasury bonds have been between +0.49 to -0.42 correlated in the last 20 years (1990-2009). Average was 0 so they are noncorrelated\n-\tAvoid the temptation to follow the herd and invest in the hottest sectors or stocks.\n-\tYou cannot eliminate all risk from a portfolio but you can reduce it\n-\tYou will lose money during some times. Don&amp;#39;t try to market time your way out of it. You can&amp;#39;t\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t chase popular investment styles. Stick with your plan and give it time to work out\n-\tIt is impossible to predict which type of fund will outperform any given year. Therefore, the best strategy is to hold a diversified portfolio that contains all types and stick with it\n-\tInternational equity provides currency diversification\n-\tGlobal equity invests in both US and international. Not usually a good idea unless you have a very small amount of money want diversification from 1 fund\n-\tGood idea to have both US AND International equities in your portfolio at all times. You don&amp;#39;t know which one will win. US won from 1970-2001 then International has won since\n-\tCanada&amp;#39;s economy is weighted heavily toward finance, energy and basic materials. Canada has lots of natural resources and investing in them acts as a hedge against commodity prices\n-\tA permanent allocation to emerging market stocks is recommended. Emerging markets are very volatile. Recently Emerging markets have increased their correlation to US markets but this may or may not continue\n-\tGenerally, the allocation to international stocks is about 30% of the equity portion of your portfolio\n-\tIndependent studies prove the size and value premium (F+F study above) works in international stocks like it does with US. This means international small cap is a good idea too\n-\tForeign stocks are subject to currency, political, trading, custody and regulatory risk. You must understand these risks. But they do provide diversification to a portfolio\n\n4 Pillars\n\n-\tForeign holdings in your portfolio should be between 15-40%. Whatever you pick, stick with it\n-\tSince you cannot successfully time the market or select individual stocks, asset allocation should be the major focus of your investment strategy, because that is all you control\n-\tDon&amp;#39;t design your portfolio based on what did well in the past.\n-\tIt is not possible to predict which portfolios will perform best in the future\n-\tOn any given year, some of your asset classes will be up and down. Do not chase results. Diversification works, even when you don&amp;#39;t want it to\n\nDeep Risk and how to protect against it\n\n - Permanent loss of capital (negative real return over a 30-year period)\n    - Severe, prolonged hyperinflation – hurts stocks and bonds but bonds more\n      - Wide diversification among international markets\n - Inflation is the most likely of the scenarios to play out. But is the easiest to protect against - International Diversification\n  - International diversification – best and cheapest to defend from deflation\n\nSkating Where the Puck Was\n\n-\tBeing far sighted is a bit easier. Resign yourself to the fact that during most bear markets, easily tradable, risk assets move up and down nearly in sync. Everyone loses money during those periods\n-\tCredit derived collapses occur about once every 9 years\n-\tWhen credit contracts during a crisis, investors reevaluate their risk tolerance, seek the comfort of government secured vehicles, and dump all their risky assets - ALL OF THEM\n-\tShort term crashes can be painful, but long-term returns are far more important to wealth creation and destruction\n-\tResign yourself that diversifying among risky assets provides scant shelter from bad days or bad years, but that it does help protect against bad decades and generations. Which can be far more destructive to wealth\n-\tWhen everyone owns the same set of risky asset classes, the correlation among them will inevitably trend toward 1\n-\tBut the inverse is true as well; when an asset class falls out of favor, its ownership transfers from weak hands into stronger and more independent minded ones, and correlations should fall along with rising future returns\n\nRational Expectations\n\n-\tA foreign stock AA of 30-45% is a reasonable one. The rest in US\n\nIAA\n\n-\tDividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases returns while decreasing risks. Most important concept in portfolio theory\n  - Two assets with positive returns should not have persistent highly negative correlations.\n    - Mixing assets with uncorrelated returns reduces risk. You can find these.\n      - In the long run though, meaningful negative (inverse) correlations are never seen. That would be too good to be true if they did.\n-\tThe optimal Asset Allocation of the last 20 years is unlikely to look anything like the one for the next 20 years.\n  - The optimal AA can only be known in retrospect\n-\tRebalancing increases long term portfolio performance\n  - It instills the investor with the discipline to buy low and sell high\n-\tIf two assets have similar long term returns and risks are not perfectly correlated, then investing in a fixed rebalanced mix of the two not only reduces risks, but also actually increases return\n  - The excess return though is not obtained without rebalancing. It forces you to buy low and sell high to rebalance your asset allocation\n-\tSticking by your AA policy through thick and thin I much more important than picking a &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; AA\n-\tBut in real life risks, returns, and correlations of various assets fluctuate considerably over time\n-\tReal assets are almost always imperfectly correlated (Mostly positive) in real life (An above average return in one is somewhat more likely to be associated with an above-average return in the other)\n  - It is difficult to find 2 assets that are uncorrelated and it is practically impossible to find 3\n-\tCorrelation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1\n  - Uncorrelated is 0\n  - Inverse is -1\n  - Perfect is +1\n-\tForeign stocks belong in everyone portfolio. The primary benefit is to reduce standard deviation or risks\n-\tSomething everyone knows isn&amp;#39;t worth knowing\n-\tEffective portfolio diversification can increase return while reducing risks. Achieving this benefit requires rebalancing the portfolio back to its target or &amp;quot;policy&amp;quot; AA. This is difficult to do and almost always involves moving against the market sentiment\n-\tLong term success in individual security selection and market timing is difficult to impossible\n-\tThe future cannot be predicted, so therefore it is nearly impossible to specify in advance what the best asset allocation will be. Our job is to find an AA that will do reasonably well under a wide range of circumstances\n-\tSticking to your target AA through thick and thin is much more important than picking the right AA\n-\tRecency bias – biggest mistake most experienced investors make\n  - We tend to extrapolate recent trends indefinitely into the future\n  - Try as hard as you can to identify the current financial wisdom so that you can ignore it\n    - In 2000, when the book was published, US was doing better than foreign stocks. What were the experts saying at that time?\n      - Stay at home for higher returns\n      - Buy only companies you know\n      - Diversify abroad at your own peril\n      - If you do diversify abroad, only do where you can drink the water\n-\tBeware of recency and do not be overly impressed with the asset class returns over periods of less than 2-3 decades.\n-\tA well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. It does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. You will still suffer loss from time to time\n-\tDiversification not only reduces risks, but also gives a &amp;quot;rebalancing bonus&amp;quot; or extra return from rigorous rebalancing.\n  - The benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. Thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market\n  - A distrust of &amp;quot;expert opinion&amp;quot; is one of the investors most useful tools\n  - It also limits your exposure to only one market segment\n\nAsset Allocation\n\n-\tModern Portfolio Theory considers each asset class not as an end in itself but rather as it stands in relationship to all others in the portfolio\n  - With a focus on asset allocation and investment policy is transforming management. Less emphasis is placed on &amp;quot;beating the market&amp;quot; and more at devising appropriate strategies\n - If I have 2 investments, both with the same 10% simple average return and one has a higher standard deviation than the other, the investment with the higher standard deviation will have a lower compound annual return.\n-\tAn ideal investment would be inversely correlated assets with similar returns. But they don&amp;#39;t exist in real life.\n  - If you had 2 investments with 10% simple average return and a negative correlation, the compound annual return would be 10% also.\n    - This doesn&amp;#39;t exist though in real life; it would be too good to be true\n-\tMost investments in real life that have similar return patterns have a slightly positive correlation to each other. Although differing in degree, most financial classes are positively correlated to each other\n  - If you have 2 portfolios with the same 10% simple average return, the one with the lower volatility will have the higher compound annual return.\n-\tHaving assets with similar return profiles and slightly positive correlations will reduce standard deviation and therefore improve the compound annual return of the portfolio. Even if the correlation is just mostly or slightly positive, it still provides a benefit\n-\tHistoric data is helpful in understanding asset class volatility and return characteristics and relationships. But precise answers to future portfolio AA decisions simply are not possible. The perfect AA is not possible except in retrospect\n-\tA portfolio that minimizes portfolio volatility for a given expected return or maximizes portfolio expected return for a given level of risk is said to be efficient\n  - The objective is to allocate assets in such a way as to have a portfolio on the efficient frontier\n-\tIf diversification is so good, why don&amp;#39;t more people do it?\n  - Lack of awareness, investors know it reduces volatility but incorrectly suspect that is impairs returns.\n  - Investors also incorrectly believe that some way exists to predict which asset class will come in first place and that they can time it\n  - It involves tracking error problems with investors. Investors use their domestic market as a frame of reference for evaluating results\n    - When the S+P 500 comes out on top, the investor incorrectly perceives that diversification has impaired their returns.\n    - Every year, the diversification strategy loses relative to some of its component assets and wins relative to others. That is the nature of diversification\n-\tThose who do not diversify pay the price by assuming a high level of volatility\n-\tVolatility is not only difficult to tolerate, but also impairs our compound returns\n-\tGlobally diversified portfolios should give investors a better relationship between the returns they want and the volatility they wish to mitigate\n-\tThe dissimilarity in patterns of returns between the U.S. and non-U.S. stock markets creates an opportunity to improve portfolio volatility adjusted returns through diversification\n-\tInvestment management is simple, but it isn&amp;#39;t easy\n\nGlobal Investing\n\n-\tGlobal portfolios provide a diversification benefit over domestic to such a degree that expansion beyond domestic borders has become practically a necessity\n  - In almost all cases a globally diversified portfolio increased return and decreased risk\n\nStocks for the Long Run\n\n-\tGlobalization of the financial markets is happening right now\n-\tThere is a negative correlation between economic growth and stock returns. This occurs in both developing and developed markets. Why? Same reason value stocks beat growth stocks. Valuation. The faster growing economics have a higher price.\n-\tExample – China is the world&amp;#39;s fastest growing economy currently, but investors in China have realized poor returns because of overvaluation. Latin America has been a better investment for the same reasons Exxon was a better investment over the last 50 years then IBM.\n-\tThen why invest in foreign companies. Diversification and reduced risks as foreign stocks are less correlated with US stocks. Sticking to a US only strategy is risky for investors\n-\tFor investors with long-term horizons, hedging currency risks in foreign stock markets may not be important\n-\tBut over shorter periods, hedging maybe advisable as bad economic news for a country depresses both its stock market and currency. Investors can avoid the latter by hedging\n  - Invest at least 1/3 of your portfolio in international stocks\n\nBook Summaries and FAQ\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/u_captmorgan50/comments/rnftyk/book_summaries/\n\nMy Foreign Positions as of 2022\n\nDFSV - US SCV\n\nDISV - Dev SCV\n\nDFEV - EM Value\n\nVIHAX - Vanguard International High Dividend Yield\n\nDODFX - Dodge and Cox International\n\nTSP - I Fund",

But they don&amp;#39;t exist in real life.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you had 2 investments with 10% simple average return and a negative correlation, the compound annual return would be 10% also.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t exist though in real life; it would be too good to be true&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Most investments in real life that have similar return patterns have a slightly positive correlation to each other. Although differing in degree, most financial classes are positively correlated to each other\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you have 2 portfolios with the same 10% simple average return, the one with the lower volatility will have the higher compound annual return.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Having assets with similar return profiles and slightly positive correlations will reduce standard deviation and therefore improve the compound annual return of the portfolio. Even if the correlation is just mostly or slightly positive, it still provides a benefit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Historic data is helpful in understanding asset class volatility and return characteristics and relationships. But precise answers to future portfolio AA decisions simply are not possible. The perfect AA is not possible except in retrospect&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  A portfolio that minimizes portfolio volatility for a given expected return or maximizes portfolio expected return for a given level of risk is said to be efficient\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The objective is to allocate assets in such a way as to have a portfolio on the efficient frontier&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  If diversification is so good, why don&amp;#39;t more people do it?\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lack of awareness, investors know it reduces volatility but incorrectly suspect that is impairs returns.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investors also incorrectly believe that some way exists to predict which asset class will come in first place and that they can time it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It involves tracking error problems with investors. Investors use their domestic market as a frame of reference for evaluating results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When the S+P 500 comes out on top, the investor incorrectly perceives that diversification has impaired their returns.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Every year, the diversification strategy loses relative to some of its component assets and wins relative to others. That is the nature of diversification&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Those who do not diversify pay the price by assuming a high level of volatility&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Volatility is not only difficult to tolerate, but also impairs our compound returns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Globally diversified portfolios should give investors a better relationship between the returns they want and the volatility they wish to mitigate&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  The dissimilarity in patterns of returns between the U.S. and non-U.S. stock markets creates an opportunity to improve portfolio volatility adjusted returns through diversification&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Investment management is simple, but it isn&amp;#39;t easy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Global Investing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Global portfolios provide a diversification benefit over domestic to such a degree that expansion beyond domestic borders has become practically a necessity\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In almost all cases a globally diversified portfolio increased return and decreased risk&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stocks for the Long Run&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Globalization of the financial markets is happening right now&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  There is a negative correlation between economic growth and stock returns. This occurs in both developing and developed markets. Why? Same reason value stocks beat growth stocks. Valuation. The faster growing economics have a higher price.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Example – China is the world&amp;#39;s fastest growing economy currently, but investors in China have realized poor returns because of overvaluation. Latin America has been a better investment for the same reasons Exxon was a better investment over the last 50 years then IBM.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Then why invest in foreign companies. Diversification and reduced risks as foreign stocks are less correlated with US stocks. Sticking to a US only strategy is risky for investors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  For investors with long-term horizons, hedging currency risks in foreign stock markets may not be important&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  But over shorter periods, hedging maybe advisable as bad economic news for a country depresses both its stock market and currency. Investors can avoid the latter by hedging\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Invest at least 1/3 of your portfolio in international stocks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Book Summaries and FAQ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/u_captmorgan50/comments/rnftyk/book_summaries/\"&gt;https://reddit.com/r/u_captmorgan50/comments/rnftyk/book_summaries/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Foreign Positions as of 2022&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DFSV - US SCV&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DISV - Dev SCV&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DFEV - EM Value&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VIHAX - Vanguard International High Dividend Yield&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DODFX - Dodge and Cox International&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TSP - I Fund&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
