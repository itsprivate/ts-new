  "selftext": "hey everyone,\n\nwanting some advice about a pretty big financial decision. essentially I'm thinking doing a cash out refi to do some home renovations and stash the rest into a low fee, total stock index like FSKAX, basically same as VTSAX. my current home loan is $350k and recent assessments say my home is worth about $1,000,000. I can probably take up to $350k cash out at 2.875% for a 30 year fix but points and closing costs are gonna cost about $10k. I recently refi-ed down to 2.625% on a 30 year fix about 9 months ago. I'll probably use about $150k for home renovations, then put $150k in FSKAX and keep $50k liquid or invest in a total bond fund and use that money to pay for part of the new higher monthly mortgage payments. By my calculations, that $50k could last around 3 years for the higher mortgage payments. After that, I hope to use proceeds from the $150k investment, my higher income, and extra income to pay the higher monthly payments. Monthly mortgage will probably increase $1,400 a month. I plan to stay in this home for at least the 10 years if not more.\n\nThe way I look at it, this is a long term investment. Take a low interest rate for my loan and use it to get a higher compounded interest return over the long run. I'm 43 and probably won't need this money for 20 - 30 years. Right now I have $400k in retirement and this year will be the first year I'm putting in around $30k in retirement ($20k in 401k, $6k Roth, and another $4k extra). I have 6 months of emergency money in cash too. I have a pretty stable job that should probably continue to go up in income as the years go. I have a 12 and 7 year old and have a decent college fund for both of them. my partner just started her own business a year ago and is self-sustaining now and hopefully will grow bigger profits  next year.\n\nmy question to the community is: Do you think this is a good investment strategy? How risky is it do borrow this much money to make potentially a lot more retirement money? Am I missing anything in my strategy? Pros and Cons? Should I take a smaller cash out so I don't have to worry about paying a huge increase in my monthly mortgage payments? Any thoughts are appreciated!\n\nChris",
