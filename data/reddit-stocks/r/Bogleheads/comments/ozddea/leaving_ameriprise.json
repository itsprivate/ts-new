A little more than doing it myself by like $60 a year but will rebalance as I get older. So think it's worth it to kind of set and forget. \n\nI have a taxable brokerage I'm moving over in kind it has LCCAX in it (the fees are crazy) I have about 14k in it with 4k unrealized. Thinking of just holding this til I need it without adding to it as will trigger a taxable event selling into something else. Most the gains have been in the last year so assuming large bit of capital gains. Not sure how to proceed with it any advice would be great. taking the money I was investing this and upping my 401k by that amount to reduce my taxable income right now (65k/year doing 20 percent into 401k now, super low cost of living so my expenses is 1200 per month with 15k safety net)\n\nKind of excited to be on the boglehead journey, Hoping my funds transfer next week to start adding to my position. Any advice would be great,  I have trying to research a lot but I feel like anyone in my position should take a hard look at what the fees are really costing you long term.",
