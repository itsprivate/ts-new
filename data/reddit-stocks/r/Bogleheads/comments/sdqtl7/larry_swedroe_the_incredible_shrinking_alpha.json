  "selftext": "**Larry Swedroe**\n\n**The Incredible Shrinking Alpha**\n\n- Beta is a measure of a stock or market volatility in relation to the overall market. 1 = standard market risk. 2 = 2x the market risk, IE your portfolio will move 2x the market. Beta = volatility\n- Alpha – The excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index is the investment&amp;#39;s alpha\n  - 20% of active managers got positive alpha in the 90&amp;#39;s. That number is down to 2%\n  - Why – The market has become more efficient. It is harder to exploit. What were sources of &amp;quot;alpha&amp;quot; are gone, dramatically reducing the ability to generate alpha. The remaining competition is going to get better and better because the men and women left standing are more skillful than the people who were playing before.&amp;quot; 90% of trading is done by institutional investors that know what they are doing. And more money is chasing that shrinking pool of alpha that is available.\n  - Taking more risks in your portfolio (IE – Leverage) doesn&amp;#39;t not increase your alpha.\n- Active management is a zero-sum game. For every winner, there must be a loser. And usually that loser is an individual investor. And more people are going toward passive management so there are less &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; at the table to exploit\n- You cannot rely on active managers to get you excess returns. You have a 1/50 chance of picking the right person.\n  - This evidence shows this is true in all asset classes. Small, Large, Value, Foreign, Bonds, etc.\n- You can&amp;#39;t forecast where the market is going. Don&amp;#39;t try to time the market.\n  - Focus on what you can control. Costs, Diversify, and Tax efficiency\n- Do not buy a home as an investment. It is place to live.\n- Once the information is readily available, prices already reflect this and it is too late to act\n- Don&amp;#39;t buy individual stocks\n- Do not buy ETN (Exchanged Traded Note) you are taking on credit risk which you are not compensated for. ETN investors with Lehman Brothers lost 85% when the company failed\n- Overvaluation of stocks tend to persist longer than undervaluation. Why? More difficult and risky for the investor to short a stock\n- Sinclair - &amp;quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it&amp;quot;\n- Markets are highly efficient in the sense that available information is rapidly digested and reflected in stock prices\n- What was once alpha, now becomes beta as different factors are discovered. IE – Benjamin Graham invested in &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; stocks. But when value was discovered as a factor, its alpha disappeared\n- Warren Buffets success can be attributed to his use of factors and not his stock picking ability\n- &amp;quot;Wisdom of the crowds&amp;quot; makes the market a very difficult competitor\n- Invest in Index funds, stay away from active managed funds\n- Generating Alpha is so difficult that Charles Ellis called active managements quest a loser&amp;#39;s game. It isn&amp;#39;t that impossible to generate Alpha. But focusing your efforts is likely to be unproductive.\n- Most investors think 3 years is a long time, 5 is a very long time, and 10 years is an eternity. Financial economists know 10 years is just &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;. Don&amp;#39;t abandon a well thought out plan\n- Investors face a choice\n  - Traditional portfolio – Market return and No tracking error regret\n  - Tilted portfolio – possible higher return and potential tracking error regret\n- 3 tests for AA\n  - The ability to take risks\n    - Investment horizon\n    - Stability of income\n    - Need for liquidity\n    - Plan &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; options\n  - The willingness to take risks\n    - Can you sleep at night?\n  - The need to take risk\n    - If you &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; the game, stop playing\n- Equity vs Fixed\n  - Increase Equity\n    - Longer time horizon\n    - High level of job security\n    - High tolerance for risk\n    - Need for higher returns to meet goals\n    - Multiple streams of income (Pensions)\n    - High marginal utility of wealth\n    - Plan &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; options\n  - Opposite of above would be a higher allocation to fixed investments\n- Value vs Growth\n  - Increase to value factor\n    - Increase expected return with increased risk\n    - Diversification of sources of risk\n  - Decrease to value or market portfolio\n    - Reduced risk\n    - Tracking error regret\n    - An owner of a value company. Example – A person whose job is in cyclical business. (Construction, Auto, etc.)\n- Small vs Large\n  - Increase to small factor\n    - Increased expected return with increased risk\n    - Stable human capital\n    - Diversification of sources of risk\n  - Decrease or market portfolio\n    - Less stable human capital\n    - Lower risk\n    - You work in a small business\n\n**Complete Guide to a successful and secure retirement**\n\n- Investors tend to buy AFTER periods of good performance and sell AFTER periods of poor performance\n- The best measure we have of estimating future returns is the Shiller CAPE ratio. Higher CAPE ratio = lower expected future returns. Average ratio is 16.5 with an average return of 6.8%\n  - 10 year estimated return per year\n  - Ratio \\&amp;lt; 9.6 = 10.3%\n  - Ratio 15.7-17.3 = 5.6%\n  - 1 – 25.1 = 0.9%\n  - \\&amp;gt;25.1 = 0.5%\n- Diversification to non-correlated assets is a winning strategy no matter what the investment horizon\n- Diversification reduces the risks of any single asset dragging down the portfolio\n- Ability to take risks\n  - Investment horizon – longer horizon = more risk\n  - Stability of earned income – IE - CRNA = more risk, Oil field worker = less risk\n  - Need for liquidity – keep 6 months reserve cash\n  - Plan &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; options – more options = more risk\n- If you have already &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; the game, why still play?\n- AA – Equity vs Fixed Income decisions\n  - Examples of higher AA to equity below\n  - Longer time horizon\n  - High level of job security\n  - High tolerance for risk\n  - Need for higher returns for financial goals\n  - Multiple streams of money – IE – pensions, SS, etc.\n  - Human capital left\n  - More options in case of a downturn\n- International AA\n  - Very important especially if you live in the USA\n  - Don&amp;#39;t fall prey to &amp;quot;home country bias&amp;quot;\n  - Don&amp;#39;t hedge the currency in your international AA\n  - 30-50% AA to international\n- 3 new factors discovered to consider\n  - Momentum – stocks with positive momentum outperform those with negative\n  - Profitability – more profitable companies outperform\n  - Quality – High quality outperform low\n- Gold\n  - Gold is an inflation hedge but only over very long periods (100+ years). Gold doesn&amp;#39;t protect against inflation over 10-year periods. Example of long horizon - Roman centurions made the same in gold as Army Captains today. The price of bread in Rome is the same as today in gold.\n  - Gold is not a good hedge of currency risk\n  - Safe Haven asset &amp;quot;stable during bear market&amp;quot; – It had an 83% success rate when stocks produced a negative return\n- Don&amp;#39;t include your home in your financial AA decisions\n- Don&amp;#39;t think about your risk assets in isolation. Think entire portfolio\n- Charles Ellis called active stock management a &amp;quot;loser&amp;#39;s game&amp;quot;. The best way to win is to not play\n- If it is possible to own a &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; fund, that is a better choice. IE – use the Vanguard Total International Fund to get your Emerging market allocation if possible, rather than buying the Emerging market fund separate. Min turnover and transaction costs\n\n**Reducing the Risks of Black Swans**\n\n- Current stock market valuations play a very important role in determining future returns\n- Shiller CAPE 10 ratio is a good ratio to think about future returns.\n- Higher ratio = lower future returns. Lower ratio = higher future returns. But there is a wide dispersion of potential outcomes\n- Your labor capital should play a role in your risk in your portfolio. More stable job = more risks in the portfolio. Less stable job = less risks in the portfolio\n- Tilting the portfolio adds the important consideration of tracking error regret. Tracking error is the amount by which a portfolios performance varies from that of the total market.\n- You basically have a little bit of super risky assets and a lot of very conservative assets. Nothing in the middle. This lowers the tail risk of the portfolio both to the positive and negative (lowers standard deviation of the portfolio).",
