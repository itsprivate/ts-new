Is it a no brainer to sell all of it as tax gain harvesting at 0% for LTCG and then rebuy it all back two seconds later? I need to get told like I’m 5yrs old. 😂 \n\nI have no reason to sell or need this money other than avoiding taxes on long term gains and I have the room to do so because I haven’t made a single dollar this year.
