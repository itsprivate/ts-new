Anyone getting a refund can do this. If you aren't getting one, or want a larger one so as to purchase the maximum amount of paper bonds ($5000), you can file an extension with a payment on the IRS Direct Pay site so as to enlarge your refund. Filing an extension doesn't mean you can't then turn around and file taxes on time anyway.\n\nI'm recording the year and month of issue and the serial number of each bond somewhere safe (like a spreadsheet backed up). If one of the paper bonds is ever lost, that's the information needed to track it down. You also have the option to mail them in to TreasuryDirect to hold electronically along with the $10,000 or so in bonds you could have purchased there. That is called a conversion-linked account if you look in the TreasuryDirect help.\n\nYou can also use Form 8888 to purchase a bond in someone else's name, like a $50 one as a birthday present for a young child. If the child is say 8 or so and slightly interested in math/investing, a paper bond and the process of looking up its value and how it is calculated could be an interesting lesson. The last four of taxpayer's SSN are unfortunately printed on the bond, so you wouldn't want to do this aside from a close family member.",
