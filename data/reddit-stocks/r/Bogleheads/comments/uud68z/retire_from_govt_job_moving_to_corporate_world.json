  "selftext": "I am retiring from a government job in a month after 25 years but only 46 years old.  I will receive a guaranteed pension (approximately $46,000/year same for spouse if I become deceased) with medical insurance fully paid.  I live in a lower cost portion of the country in the south. Spouse will continue working in a government job for next 10 or so years and will then receive a pension.  I plan on moving to the corporate world for the next 10 years and we both plan to fully retire at 56.  We are able to live comfortably on my pension and my wife's salary.  We only have about 75k in other savings/investments.  I plan on making an additional $100,000 or so per year which I would like to fully invest.  I am trying to determine what you believe would be the best approach.  I don't want a hands on approach and trade stocks, etc.  Do I just simply purchase $7,000 of a VT or similar ETF per month in a taxable account?  I would then sell only when I need it after we fully retire (trying to be aware of only selling to minimize capital gains).  What would be your approach?",
