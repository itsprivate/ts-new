If I had said yes I would have been directed to a department that wasn't trained to help with the questions I had.\n\nI wanted to find out if I could do conversions from an old Trad 401k administered by VG to my VG Roth IRA. It turned out I could but the 401k was going to charge me a transaction fee for every conversion. At that point I decided to roll the account into a VG Trad IRA. The customer service representative (CSR) was very helpful guiding me through the online process and waited while I took notes so I could roll over my wife's accounts later. At one point I was asked to select a dollar range for net worth. I joked with the CSR that I was going to get found out that I fibbed to the robo menu when I said no I didn't have 300,000 to invest.

If I had said yes I would have been directed to a department that wasn't trained to help with the questions I had.\n\nI don't think I'm overstating it when I say the websites are a disaster but she new them in and out and was very pleasant and professional. When I noticed the ticker on my new account was different than the 401k she waited patiently while I checked the ERs and then tried to get me a better ER. When that didn't work she helped me change the receiving fund to VTWAX. That action required me to click a button labbled \"restart\"! I would never have clicked that button on my own in a million years.\n\nI could go on and on about the glitches in the websites but she did a great job of guiding me through.\n\nI called at 7 PM eastern to get a shorter wait time and was on hold for an hour.
