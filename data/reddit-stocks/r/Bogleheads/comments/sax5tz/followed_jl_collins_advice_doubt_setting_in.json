Every rational part of my brain is saying to keep cool and remember the teachings in the books. The totally logical reasons for investing in the first place and that I have a 15-20 year horizon to help things revert to the mean. And yet, knowing all this — understanding it intimately — my emotions are running wild right now.

By which point, I will likely be down well into the 6 figures. I won’t ever sell, I’d rather see it drop to 0 (I know, not really possible). But emotionally, I really thought I’d be handling this better.\n\nI just can’t believe I agonized over this every single day for almost 5 months and when I finally worked up the courage to follow the sound advice of experts, it seems I might have made the exact wrong decision. Maybe this year ends up being the 1/3 of the time that DCA is the better approach. Typical. And now in hindsight, it does seem kind of obvious with the run up we had in 2020/2021. *sigh*",
