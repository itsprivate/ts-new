Collins makes a very sound argument for lump sum investing (based on empirical data) and it really resonated with me. Particularly because I sold my business back in late 2021 and had a lump sum to invest. I was one of the lucky ones to be in this position…or so I thought.\n\nI researched, read hundreds of posts on investing forums, read several books (including the Millionaire Teacher), put together an amazing spreadsheet for tracking and eventually worked up the courage to invest basically all of it into VTI/VXUS as a lump sum when the market first started to really dip.\n\nThat was the first two weeks of January. Every rational part of my brain is saying to keep cool and remember the teachings in the books. The totally logical reasons for investing in the first place and that I have a 15-20 year horizon to help things revert to the mean. And yet, knowing all this — understanding it intimately — my emotions are running wild right now. I endured 2008 when I was just starting my career, I got through March 2020 without too much of a sweat…But this time, I’m dealing with an amount of money much larger than anything I’ve ever invested before. \n\nLike everyone else, I don’t have a crystal ball but it seems the writing might be on the wall for what’s to come over the next while. By which point, I will likely be down well into the 6 figures. I won’t ever sell, I’d rather see it drop to 0 (I know, not really possible). But emotionally, I really thought I’d be handling this better.\n\nI just can’t believe I agonized over this every single day for almost 5 months and when I finally worked up the courage to follow the sound advice of experts, it seems I might have made the exact wrong decision. Maybe this year ends up being the 1/3 of the time that DCA is the better approach. Typical. And now in hindsight, it does seem kind of obvious with the run up we had in 2020/2021. *sigh*",
