With some money I made from part time jobs and his own contributions over the years, it now looks like this:\n\n\\- 30% FNILX  \n\\- 40% FXAIX  \n\\- 30% FZROX  \nValue: \\~$1000\n\nI wasn't very consistent on contributing to it but now I've been working more (especially over this summer). Long story short, now that I'm over 18, I was planning on opening another Roth with Fidelity and transfering the funds over as you do when the minor gets old enough. \n\nAfter reading 'The Simple Path to Wealth', I learned a lot about the Boglehead philosophy and VTSAX. Obviously, I don't want to pay a $75 fee to invest VTSAX, and I figured FZROX would be a fine alternative. But reading on this sub, I found two things:\n\n\\- Going all in on FZROX with a Fidelity Roth IRA means I can never transfer the funds to another broker  \n\\- VTI is a really really good ETF\n\nI'm now thinking I should just open a Vanguard Roth IRA instead and go all in on VTI. I've got a little over $1k\\~ I've been waiting to invest into my Fidelity Roth IRA for a while but never got around to it since I never actually did the minor account transfer stuff.\n\nWhat do you think is the best course of action? Leave the Fidelity Roth IRA go and start over with a new one with Vanguard? Should I invest in both VTSAX and VTI?\n\nYour advice and time is greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",
