Thanks in advance.*\n\n-------------\n\nAs I see it, **being a Boglehead is about simple, low-cost, broad-market, passive indexing of major investable asset classes**. So back when I started out with globally indexing, one of the things that caught my attention was frontier markets. For context: **frontier markets are tiny markets that are often too small, illiquid, and/or risky to be included in a typical emerging markets index**. Together, these small markets only represent a few percent of the global stock market cap, but I thought maybe there was an opportunity to get in early and benefit from the risk/reward characteristics of these less-indexed countries.\n\nBut the more research I did, the more problems I found. For one thing, frontier market funds were more expensive. And since most (if not all) frontier funds seemed to overlap partly with low-cost emerging markets index funds, buying them would mean paying more for some redundancy. *What I mean is: if I pay a 1% ER on a fund that has 1/3 overlap with another fund I own cheaply, I'd be effectively paying more like a 1.5% ER for that 2/3 I actually want.*\n\nThen, too, there was the size of these as a percent of the global market. I asked myself: is it really worth it to add something that will amount to less than 5% of my portfolio? I ultimately decided that no, it was not a meaningful enough percent to slice and dice for. **In short: Given fees and size, frontier markets would have added more cost and complexity than I wanted to take on.** Now consider these two ETFs for a moment:\n\n--------------\n\n**FM - iShares MSCI Frontier and Select EM ETF**\n\n* 0.79% ER\n* Just 27% in the largest country (Vietnam) followed by 8 more countries with 5%+ stakes\n\n**BITW - Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF**\n\n* 2.50% ER\n* Over 60% in the largest crypto (BTC) and 90% in just two coins (BTH and ETH) -- the rest are less than 5%\n\n----------------\n\nSo FM is cheaper and more broadly diversified than BITW. And going back to my issues with FM: first there's that question of overlap. BITW holders pay big fees for relatively little diversification, and most of what they get is two cryptos they already have both direct and indirect exposure to via technology stocks in low-cost index funds (some big public companies even outright own coins). Sure, one can instead just buy the constituent parts and 'roll their own' index, but (as I wrote above), simplicity is a factor, too -- set and forget, as they say.\n\nAlso, some indexers who are also crypto advocates insist that they're just taking the next step logical in diversification. But that got me wondering: if one were trying to be a completionist about indexing, why wouldn't that person start with frontier markets? They cost less and it makes sense if you're indexing *everything possible*. If the costs of adding crypto are *higher* than the costs of being fully diversified within stocks, why not do both, basically?\n\nIf your true goal is to have greater diversification, then to me it would make sense to start with things like frontier markets, commodities, and other major asset classes and sub-classes that are simpler, cheaper, and so forth. I'm not advocating for that *or for* frontier markets, just pushing back against the 'hold everything' theory of crypto indexing. Because if that's really one's goal, there are many other things one would presumably include. Jumping straight to crypto seems *to me* like performance chasing, and 'holding everything' a justification.\n\nSome folks think that us non-crypto Bogleheads are too 'close-minded' about this, so just to put it out there: if crypto gets bigger, cheaper, and easier to index, I'll at least reconsider my view. But until/unless it crosses the 5% threshold in terms investable global assets, I'm personally not going to spend my time/money 'investing' on this front. What you do with your money is up to you, I'm just sharing my thought process on these lower-cap assets. YMMV.\n\n**Thanks for coming to my TED Talk**\n\n*P.S. Just one final reminder to please keep any conversations below civil and on-topic. Thanks in advance!*",
