I guess it was okay at first since they did get me started and freed me from a life of CDs and savings account. Hell, I would've missed a lot of returns over the last 4 years with all that money in cash, so I can't get too upset I guess. I guess the training wheels came off, and the eroding power of fees came to light. However, I would also like to caution everyone out there that these people don't really know much more, if not less, than you do. A few months ago, I had my yearly \"meeting\" with Edward Jones to discuss my portfolio. They mentioned I was very overweight in energy as I had put a lot of cash into oil stocks in March 2020. They had advised I consider selling it and going into tech, which I am rather \"light\" by comparison. Imagine if I had dumped oil in order to buy overpriced only to watch oil moon, and tech to dump? I would easily be down 15-20%. \n\nAlthough, I know this group favors index fund/ETFs and I am migrating that way with my IRA/401k and \\~60k in cash I just freed up from some god awful mutual funds they had shoved me into. My IRA was in 12 funds, and I was in another 6 in my taxable account. All of course had high loads and high expense ratios. I AM FREE THOUGH! My plan is slowly to unwind my individual stocks as they top out and move them all into index funds within my brokerage. Sick of following 30+ tickers. EJ is for my mother and her friends who would otherwise have their money under their mattress or in CDs. Thanks again and glad to becoming a boglehead!",
