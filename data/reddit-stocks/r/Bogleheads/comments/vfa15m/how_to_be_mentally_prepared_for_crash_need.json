We saved and invested as much as we can with the aim that we can somewhat achieve FI in our mid 40s (we are flexible about retiring early though). We only keep cash for emergency fund, and invest the rest.\n\nSince I started investing in mid 2018, till Dec 2021 we have enjoyed a good bull run such that at end of 2021, my portfolio was 730k from 460k total initial capital. I am mainly invested in global market fund just as average Bogle does, with 5-10% fun allocation that has done pretty well too. It feels good, really. Everyone feels like genius in a bull market. \n\nHowever, as of today, my portfolio is 530k, roughly loss 200k ytd. Can't believe that my gains evaporated so quickly in a matter of 6 months.\n\nThis loss is huge relative to my annual income at about 100k post-tax. The thought of losing 2x annual salary in a matter of 6 months makes me shaken. I get mentally anxious during the day, difficult to focus at work, while contemplating hard whether to just hold, vs keep buy, vs sell to risk off. The thought of losing 2-3 months salary in 1 trading day really affects me (which happened several times in last few days).\n\nI thought: Maybe i invested too much relative to my income? (Though i dont need the these money in the short term anyway, it's for retirement in 15-20 years). Maybe my risk tolerance is not as big as I thought? \n\nI feel like my dca barely dents my overall portfolio since my monthly investment now severely reduced due to 2 kids that we need to care now. So averaging down feels like a less effective way for me to 'feel better'. I feel the urge to just sell everything to prevent further loss, knowing that uncertainty about economy is still looming till end of year. Most experts expect severe recession coming, and I dont think the market has fully priced in the worst possible outcome (we are just 22% down vs 38-55% in previous major bubbles, there are lots of room down further). While each crash is different in situation, i dont think we are anywhere near bottom yet understanding the problems : inflation 40 yr high, historic customer sentiment low, highest interest rate hike since 1994, war in ukraine affecting harvest, oil and gas, regionalisation, countries running to debt, etc.. I was thinking: I'd rather sell now and perhaps miss a bit of gains later, until there are some economic certainty and recovery sentiment in the problems listed above. Surely it's wiser than riding the full crash? But this clearly deviates with true bogle principle.\n\nDoes anyone in the sub feel similarly: having your portfolio to be more than 5-7x more than your annual income? How can you stay sane knowing that the daily fluctuation is huge compared to your salary? How can you resist the urge to swing trade (sell before major macro event / data released if risk is to high), or just sell everything ?\n\nApologise for long post. Just thinking out loud, feel a bit lost.",
