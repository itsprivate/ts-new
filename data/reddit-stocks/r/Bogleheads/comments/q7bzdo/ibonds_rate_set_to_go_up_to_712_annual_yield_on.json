For those looking to diversify their long term fixed income holdings, getting locked in at this rate for 6 months starting in November may be a good idea. You'd have to wait a few weeks until the calendar flips to November to buy.  Too bad there is a $10K yearly cap on direct buy-ins per SSN, but at least one can buy in again in January for the same rate.\n\nYou can also see that COLA on Social Security is going up 5.9% for those who take it or have family/friends that do. U.S. income brackets, 401k, IRA, and other retirement account limits all take inflation adjusted increases, so we will see soon how those change for 2022.",
