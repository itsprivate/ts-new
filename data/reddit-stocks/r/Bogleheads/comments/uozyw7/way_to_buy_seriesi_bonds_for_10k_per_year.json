I recently found out that there is in fact a way to do this using the gifting feature of ibonds through TreasuryDirect. \n\nIn Jan this year, I bought ibonds for my wife and I for $10k each. Earlier this month, after the new inflation rates were published, I purchased ibonds from **MY** account as a gift in my **Wife's** name for $10k. I did the same from my Wife's account in my name.\n\nBuying ibonds as gifts is a two step process - Buying and Delivering. These two need not be executed at the same moment. iBonds as gifts will count against the recipient's $10k limit for the year, but only AFTER they are delivered to the recipient. \n\nBoth the interest and the holding period for these iBonds purchased as gifts begin in the month that they get purchased, even if they don't get delivered.\n\nSo in my case, my wife and I will both let these iBonds sit in our TreasuryDirect gift boxes accruing the higher interest rates and once the rates fall, lets say going into 2023, then we will \"deliver\" these in Jan 2023 and have it count against our 2023 limit. \n\nWe may even do this again in October this year depending on what the November rates are and use them against our 2024 limit.\n\nObviously depending on your individual situation, who you are buying this as a gift for etc, you'd have to check the tax implications. But overall, this feels like a good way to put some additional money to work and take advantage of the environment that we are in.",
