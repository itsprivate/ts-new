I may fit into a weird category since I still dont know if I want to reside here (the US) forever, for now i am a green card holder. I would like to study in switzerland and I know its pretty expensive. I cant and dont want to be very financially dependent on my parents. I am studying and aiming for software engineer  path so I know money will be out there. I dont know if theres something I should know specific to my circumstances, but I would really like some pointings on what direction to take, specially financially.  For as what I currently know, is that ive been lurking and reading this sub and some others, it seems that i dont really have that much options for such a short term return, at least by what I know to date.\n\nI would really apreciate some advice, if you were to need for some more info just ask!.",
