  "selftext": "I started saving for retirement in the mid/late 2000's.  At the time, the standard BH recommendations regarding asset allocation tended to be one of: (1) always keep at least 25% in bonds (Graham), often softened to 20%, or (2) age in bonds (Bogle) / age-10 in bonds.  These rules of thumb are still on the BH.org wiki ([https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset\\_allocation#Rules\\_of\\_thumb](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation#Rules_of_thumb)), but I don't see many recent recommendations for them here or on the BH.org forum.\n\nFor the last few years, the most common recommendation has been to stay at 0-10% bonds until 5-10 years before retirement, and once retired, either stop adding bonds at 40% or 50%, or at least take longer to get to 30/70 than earlier recommendations.  Similarly, ten or so years ago, the glidepaths on many target retirement funds were made more aggressive than they had been at the funds' inception.  (There's an interesting paper, published in 2013 or 2014 I think, which shows how TDFs from several fund families changed.  But I haven't been able to remember the exact name of the paper to find it again.)\n\nI didn't use any TDF or directly use the Graham or Bogle rules of thumb when planning a glidepath for my asset allocation for my late 20's through retirement.  But I did use them as guideposts in coming up with my own, which had me at 80/20 at age 30, 70/30 at age 40 (my current allocation), and would have began to shed equities quickly starting in my mid-40's, to get me to 40/60 by age 55 for a potential early retirement.\n\nLast year, I realized how far my glidepath, which I had followed without really thinking about it in a long time, was from the new normal.  I didn't want to reverse course and go back to a higher equity allocation, but I also didn't want to underestimate the psychological pressure I might feel to change after seeing a more aggressive allocation do much better than my own portfolio.  So I decided on a new glidepath that freezes my bond allocation at 30% for a few years, then glides to 60/40 at age 50, and 50/50 in my late 50's and throughout my 60s.\n\nJust curious who else has considered altering a plan from the 2000's to align more closely with the conventional wisdom of the 2010's and 2020's.",
