The rest is in individual stocks with many having large gains (nvidia, AMD, Apple, MSFT). \n\nI’d like to switch to a more boglehead approach, but I’m not sure how to go about it since most of the assets are individual stocks with high gains. How would you go about selling off the individual stocks and putting it back into ETFs?\n\nI am 35 years old and am curious how feasible early retirement is with this windfall. I could easily live off of 120k or less yearly, which falls under 3%. Is that a safe amount to pull out every year, and would it be better to pull out 10k a month? And if that is a safe amount to be living off of every year, about how much more wiggle room do I have to donate to charity or friends every year, without digging into the principle? And How would you go about living off of the interest? Im assuming selling equities when they are on a good run, and selling bonds when stocks are down. I have no debts, I own a house and car, I live in California, and everything in the portfolio I inherited has long term gains. \n\nOverall, I’d like to grow this nest egg so that I can be even more charitable in the future. The most important thing is that I don’t start eating away at the principle. \n\nI feel very overwhelmed having this amount of money land on my lap. So any advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nTLDR: what would you do with 6 million dollars?",
