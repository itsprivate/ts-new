Furthermore, the ability to defer or reduce taxes is one of the biggest advantages we have as investors. The variety between regions doesn't make generalizations 'pointless' at all -- these variations are critical factors in determining how to invest. And tax drag absolutely matters -- if it didn't, there would be little point to tax-deferred investing strategies. The ability to strategically control the timing and amount of taxes one pays on investment gains can easily make six-figure differences over a lifetime.

There are plenty of helpful wiki pages and other resources covering these basics --- tax-efficient investing allows ordinary investors to vastly improve their long-term gains. I am at a loss to understand how something so critical to even the most basic (dividend or other) portfolio strategy could be outright banned.\n\nPlease don't brigade the dividend sub (or any other sub for that matter). I'm posting this not as a mod but as a user who is legitimately dumbfounded by the idea that such a critical issue could be banned from discussion altogether. I hope any subscribers to that sub will feel free to ask questions here. For those of you interested in dividend-centric strategies: consider taxation first and foremost, because tax drag can be a huge hindrance to your returns. And in the end, it's total returns that matter (after taxes and fees), whether those come from growth or dividends.\n\nIf you're confused or curious about dividends, [Ben Felix has a solid video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ).",
