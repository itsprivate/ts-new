  "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nBeen following the Boglehead investing strategy since Fall 2019. Since then, between my 401k, Roth IRA, and individual brokerage account - I have a little over 100k + currently invested in the stock market. I think this is a great checkpoint for someone who just turned 30.\n\nI feel the Boglehead strategy of passive investing is the best strategy for me, so I would like to hold onto what I have and finalize automatic withdrawals/investments/and dividend reinvestments in my portfolio and have the investment process be somewhat autonomous moving forward. \n\nBefore I do, I would like to get some advice/review on my current portfolio to determine if there is anything I would benefit from changing. I am currently maxed on my ESPP contribution, maxed contribution for Roth IRA for 2022, and contributing 10% to 401K (matched to 6% by employer). Below are my current holdings:\n\n\n401K (80% - Fidelity Total Stock Market Index, 20% - Fidelity Total International Index)\n\nRoth IRA (80% in SCHD, 20% in SCHY)\n\nIndividual Brokerage (75% in Fidelity SP 500 index, 25% in ESPP/personal stock investments)\n\n\nI realize there is a lot of overlap between my investments, but I figured that these investments are solid for passive investment/growth, and it will be fun to see how comparative funds compete. Please let me know if there is anything I could look into, or change about my portfolio.\n\nThank you!",
