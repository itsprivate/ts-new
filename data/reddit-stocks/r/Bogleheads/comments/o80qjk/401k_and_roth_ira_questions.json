  "selftext": "Hi all, hope you are all doing well. \n\nI started a new job fairly recently and am trying to figure out my retirement strategy. I am in my mid 20s, so I feel comfortable investing somewhat aggressively. I'm considering investing in 100% equities. \n\nI currently am fully contributing to a 2060 target date fund my 401k offers but am considering switching. All of the funds in my 401k are not mutual funds so I can't do any research other than the documents my plan provides. After reading my target fund fact sheet it is a mixture of passive and actively traded funds. The expense ratio is 0.26%. The fund has a split of 60/30/10 U.S., international, and bonds currently. \n\nI was originally thinking of keeping this but am potentially interested in switching it up. I have the option of a large cap S&P 500 index fund with an expense ratio of 0.013%, Russell Small Cap Completeness Index with  0.032% expense ratio, international MSCI ACWI index fund with 0.07% expense ratio, and fixed income index tracking the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index with 0.027% expense ratio. I was wondering what everyone's recommended portfolio constructions would be with these choices.\n\nI also have the option to use BrokerageLink. I was originally considering FZROX+FZILX or FSKAX+FTIHX for my Roth IRA fund I plan to open. I believe I could do that with BrokerageLink for my 401k as well. Do you guys believe this could be a better choice than the default passive index funds my plan offers?\n\nI like the idea of a hands off approach but since my target fund is private I can't invest in that in my Roth IRA. Thus, I was thinking of either FZROX+FZILX or FSKAX+FTIHX for my Roth IRA. I think anywhere from a 70/30 to 60/40 domestic/international split could be good. I saw a lot of opinions of people on here that they would not mix target fund in 401k with index mutual funds in Roth IRA. That is why I am considering switching up my 401k approach from the target date fund. \n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.",
