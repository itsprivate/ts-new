My mom got my dad's small ROTH IRA and has an an annuity we are waiting to draw from in the future when she is done working. I have about $60K in cash to invest to try and make as much money as I can for her. My thoughts process is 80% VTSAX/20% VTIAX and be super aggressive. She is 67 and normally you would want a ton of bonds/cash but with inflation and her lack of retirement, I figured it's time to be aggressive regardless of her age. If the market tanks for a bit and she needs money, the 3 sons will step in and take care of her but overall she is in pretty good health and could live another 15-20 years. Really appreciate your help and guidance.\n\nEdit: Had international and US swapped",
