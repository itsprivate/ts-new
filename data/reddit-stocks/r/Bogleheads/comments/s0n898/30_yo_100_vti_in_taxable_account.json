I know it's common to recommend bonds, but not sure this makes sense in a taxable account hence why I was considering 100% VTI. I have a lot of assets in cash I've saved over the past few years that I haven't invested yet so wanted to design a full plan here. I'll probably take 20% into individual stocks I believe in, but I want a strong base which I believe bogleheads can help me build out.",
