Our son is suggesting we switch to more stocks. 80/20, though we think 70/30 might be better. Son says go with VOO or VTI and iBonds or something equivalent for the rest. He says keep it easy and then we won't need to go with a fiduciary to manage the investments.\nOur ages are 51 and 52 (advice giving son is 21). We won't need to touch these funds for 15 plus years (so we hope). I'm torn between going with a fiduciary, using something like Wealthfront, or setting it up myself. Would appreciate advice as this is a new situation for us. Thanks in advance.",
