Additionally, because of this, there's a high likelihood that while we don't have any financial discrepancy now, I'll likely have a lot more in retirement because of avoiding fees. I want to help and make this easy for her, or at least know they're not pushing her into high ER funds with front end commissions.\n\nI'm looking for advice from anyone else in mixed households out there of a Boglehead and financial advisor user, and how you've found balance in this situation.
