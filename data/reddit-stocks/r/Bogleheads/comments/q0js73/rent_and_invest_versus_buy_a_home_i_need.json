I've tried asking similar in personal finance or real-estate sub-Reddits and get a lot of very vocal replies like my \"not understanding leverage\" or \"buy now or get priced out forever.\" This is at odds with the numbers I've run and I feel like Bogleheads are less likely to be biased.\n\nI rent a 2-bedroom apartment in Centretown Ottawa at significantly below \"market rate\" ($1000+ about $100 in utilities) because I've occupied the same unit for a long time, and I've invested some money (equivalent to 3-month rent) renovating. Ergo, the place has the same \"quality\" as a home that I'd have purchased and made my own.\n\nI sock away about $2000/mo in savings, maxing out RRSP and TFSA (edit - Canadian registered accounts, rough equivalents to the 401k and Roth IRA), now funneling it into a non-registered account and it's all in Vanguard VGRO at this time. (80/20 equity/fixed income)\n\nAdditionally, I'm accruing an inflation-indexed defined-benefit pension that'll pay out about $50k/year when I retire, plus any other old age pensions (CPP - the Canada Pension Plan, and OAS, Old Age Security).\n\nIf I were to buy a condo, the non-recoverable expenses (taxes, condo/HOA fees, utilities etc) would be roughly equivalent to my rent right now. That's not an exaggeration - they're relatively high in this city. Ergo, even if I were \"gifted\" a condo, my \"rent\" would be about the same.\n\nThere'd be virtually no lifestyle change between these two homes.\n\nSoooo... I can either keep socking away $2000+/mo, or take out a mortgage and all of the savings go into that. (condo prices are inflated if you go by Bill Bernstein's metric of \"180x monthly rent\" - anything comparable to my apartment starts at $450,000)\n\nI don't see it.\n\n**To me, the real calc is: if I'm investing my surplus, will my investments grow faster than home price appreciation over the course of my life?**\n\nObviously if homes go parabolic and 20 years from now that condo is $10,000,000, I'm WAY better off buying now to have some kind of housing security. (rents on newly vacant units are double what I pay now) \n\nIf home price growth stabilizes (the Case-Shiller Index [suggests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case%E2%80%93Shiller_index#Economic_implications) they revert to mean over long time horizons), and I keep paying cheap rent and investing my savings, I come out way ahead over long time horizons: instead of \"mortgage headwinds\" I've got \"compound-interest tailwinds.\"\n\nFWIW, I am past child-bearing age and have no intention of having kids. My partner has their own place with similar financials and we're quite happy with this arrangement. This is entirely about numbers, not \"your lifestyle may change.\" (my job is rock solid - I made a career switch after the 2007-2008 GFC)\n\nI feel like I'm taking crazy pills. \n\nHelp?!",
