Right now she is 100% in a blue chip growth fund inside of the 401k, and I believe is contributing around 8% of her paycheck. I urge her to increase her contributions, but she is in the process of paying off some minor credit card debt, and also is a single woman who pays most of her bills her self (with some help from her adult sons). \n\nWith that said, my real question at this point is weather or not she should stay in the blue chip fund, or maybe reallocate into something more conservative. With her age she needs to play catch up a bit, so I feel that a blue chip fund is relatively conservative while also having the potential for significant growth. I also really don’t want her to face a taxable event in transferring her money into another fund. \n\nShe is a really great person who has gone through a lot in life and works so hard in a difficult retail job, so I want more than anything for her to have a pleasant retirement. \n\nAny advice or recommendations greatly appreciated!",
