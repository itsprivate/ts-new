I just worry that if something catastrophic happens, and those funds get absolutely hammered alongside VTI, then I'll lose out on tons of compounding later in life due to the amount the huge drawdowns they take. my aggressive portfolio is down 18% more than VTI, so -39% YTD. but nonetheless I'm comfortable and staying the course in both, as this is basically just a slow bleed.\n\nanyway TL:DR am I too aggressive in investing?",
