I have couple of questions I hope someone with more knowledge can answer.\n\n1. Very early on in Bogle's book (haven't finished the whole thing), it is made clear that essentially you want to invest in the market with minimal additional cost. This assumes that the stock market will always grow over a 20-30 year horizon. This is backed well by the fact that the US economy depends on it, and will take (presumably) drastic measures to ensure its continuity. My question is why do we assume that the stock market has infinite growth? Why is the possibility of saturation not considered? Is it not possible that we have been living in a 'golden age' of sorts and perhaps it may end in some 50-100 years, as has happened to many prospering nations throughout history.\n2. I find most of bogle's points very hard to refute or disagree with. Which is great implying his foundations are solid. Bogle does say that the average investor always underperforms compared to the market average. This implies that, if I have the confidence that I'm an above average investor/capable of being one, it is better for me to play the market? Basically, I bet not on the fact that I know how to pick stocks, but rather, that I am smarter at understanding the market than 50% of the people in the game. The more smarter, the more money I stand to gain. Does this line of thinking have a flaw?\n\nThese are just philosophical questions in nature. In practice I intend to monthly pump and dump in some index fund and chill. Because as I see it, not only do I not have to actively use my brain to make good bets (meaning I am also not susceptible to tilting), I also save a lot of time with this method. Glad to have found this philosophy pretty early in life.",
