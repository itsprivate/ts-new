Income and assets are disclosed in ranges on the form.\n\nHis biggest holding, of between $25 million and $50 million, was in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF.\n\nGensler also said he had $50,001 to $100,000 in capital gains from his holding of Tesla Inc. shares, the only individual stock that’s listed. That asset is now fully divested, according to the filing.\n\nGensler said he participates in the defined benefit plan at Goldman, where he was a partner earlier in his career. He said the retirement plan is expected to pay out $977 per month starting at age 71.\n\nDow Jones reported some of the figures from the filing earlier Friday.\n\nMuch of Gensler’s money comes from his years at Goldman, which he joined in the late 1970s out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. His mentor was Robert Rubin, who rose to vice chairman of the firm before becoming Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. Gensler had stints trading stocks and bonds, and also worked on the mergers-and-acquisition team. Eventually he became one of the youngest partners in the firm’s history.",
