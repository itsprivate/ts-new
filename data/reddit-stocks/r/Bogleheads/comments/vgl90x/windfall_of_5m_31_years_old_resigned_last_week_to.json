Made a throwaway account because i’d like to stay anonymous.\n\nSo I have received a windfall of $5M about 1 year ago (I’m 31 years old right now). Haven’t touched the money for a year, so I could research what to do with it.\n\n**Conclusion of my research**: low fee broad-market index fund (for stocks and bonds).\n\nBased on ERN’s research ([https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/)) I decided to go with a SWR of 3% in up markets and trim it down to 2.5% on down years (to lower sequence risk). Also, during a downturn I will withdraw from the bond allocation instead of equities (this will give me 10+ years of runtime before I have to sell equities). Will rebalance accordingly of course.\n\nAlso important to mention: I have a paid off house that is big enough for starting a family later on the road.\n\nBecause I live in Europe, most standard index funds are not available. I’ve chosen the following index funds:\n\n\\-EQUITIES = **VWCE** (Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF USD Acc) (ISIN: IE00BK5BQT80)\n\n\\-BONDS = **DBZB** (Xtrackers II Glbal Governmnt Bnd UCITS ETF 1C HEUR) (ISIN: LU0378818131)\n\n**VWCE** because it’s accumulating and that gives me tax benefits. **DBZB** consist of globally diversified treasuries only because corporate bonds can be correlated with equities.\n\nBased on my research I’m pretty sure my choice of index funds and SWR is solid. However, i’m not sure about the allocation. I was thinking of **70/30** or **60/40** or maybe even **50/50** (because some say why keep playing if you already won ?). All three the allocation have a 100% succes rate when using a 3% SWR according to ERN’s research. However, this is based on past performance.\n\nAlso to keep in mind: as the title says, at the moment I don’t have any income and i’m working on a side business of which I hope one day will give me some income. So for now I can be considered “retired”.\n\nThanks a lot!",
