First, i'm 28 years old at the end of this week (so technically still 27 :D) and i was looking for a long term investment that wouldn't require too much managment. Here is the plan i came with:\n\n40% QQQ - 30% VTI - 30% VXUS\n\nI was pretty happy about this plan, being in my late twenties QQQ makes sense and i get plenty of diversity, i'm just a little worried than VTI and QQQ may be over priced at the moment. I'm planning to go DCA and invest about 10k a month. But still, should i be heavier on VXUS ? Don't you guys think the US market is a little risky at the moment ? It has been out performing for a while at the point that it looks really expensive!\n\nThe only reason i don't go full VT is because i believe growth should be part of my portfolio since i'm still \"young\". What's your opinion about it ?\n\nThanks !",
