My friend is 45 years old, newly divorced with two college aged children and an 80 year old mother who lives with her (thought this info was important bc she does contribute to them financially). \n\nShe will be able to work as a nurse and start saving for retirement in January 2024, so I guess she will be 46 at that point. She has a paid off home, a small savings but ZERO retirement. What advice would you give someone in her position in applying the Bogle strategy/methodology? Hopefully I can convince her to create an account and join this sub. We are meeting for coffee next week and I’d love to give her some pointers/advice (she’s heard me mention investing/saving in passing and asked me some questions). Thanks, everyone!",
