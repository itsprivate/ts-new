Management normally sells 2.3 shares for every 1 share they buy. In 1987 after the crash, it was 4 buys for 1 sell\n- Avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry, any stock being touted as the next X\n- A share of stock is NOT a lotto ticket. It is a part ownership of a business\n- P/E ratio can be thought of as the number of years to earn back your original investment. IE = P/E of 10 would be 10 years assuming earnings stay constant. Ratios tend to be lower for slow growers and highest for the fast growers with cyclicals in between depending on the current cycle.\n- Look at average P/E ratios on the company you are researching and peers going back several years to determine if it is a good buy\n- Avoid stocks with HIGH P/E ratios. They must have incredible earnings growth to justify the price\n- P/E ratio that is half the growth rate (annual earnings) is very positive and one that is twice the growth rate is very negative. IE = P/E of 10 should be growing at 10%\n- Formula = Growth rate plus dividend yield divided by P/E. IE = 12% growth + 3% yield/10 P/E = 1.5. Less than 1 is bad. 1.5 is ok and 2+ is great.\n- The stock market as a whole has its own collective P/E ratio, which is a good indicator of weather the market at large is over or under valued. If some stocks are selling at inflated prices relative to earnings, then it could be likely most stocks are selling at inflated prices.\n- Interest rates have a large effect on p/e ratios as investors pay higher p/e when interest rates are lower and bonds less attractive\n- Dividend paying stocks keep the stock price from falling as far as if there was no dividend\n- You CAN&#39;T predict future earnings. Wall Street has battalions of analysts trying to do this and they are wrong a lot.\n- Cash Flow – amount of money a company takes in as a result of doing business. You want to buy companies that don&#39;t need to spend a lot of money to make money IE = company spends 20 million to make 100 million is better than one that needs to spend 90 million to make 100 million. Formula = $20 stock with $2 per share annual cash flow has a 10-1 ratio which is standard (10%). $20 stock with $4 CF = 20% return on cash. Focus on free cash flow – what is left over after normal capital spending is taken out\n- Debt to equity ratio - normal is 25% debt to 75% equity but higher equity % is better",
