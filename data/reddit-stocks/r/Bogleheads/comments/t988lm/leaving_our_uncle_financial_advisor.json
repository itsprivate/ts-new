All of which have load fees. \n\nSecurity benefit offers a Vanguard S&amp;P 500 mutual fund (VFIAX) that he does not have us investing in. I’m wanting to get out of it all together and transfer my Roth to my Merrill Edge account connected to my bank, where I can control it completely myself. \n\nWith all of this being said, I’m not sure how to approach the situation. I’m not asking for investing advice or recommendations, simply how to handle this. Should I stay with him and adamantly speak up about my desire to change funds? Should I let it be? Should I just do my own thing?  Should I just change future contributions to the asset allocation I want without even approaching him about any of this? \n\nI am 32 and my wife and I have been married for less that a year.",
