They’ll be renting in a retirement community thereafter.\n\nMy folks have never been savers/investors—they dedicated a significant chunk of their disposable income to Hummel Figurines, Beanie Babies, and Jewelry purchased from TV ads. I wish I were kidding. But, it’s time (actually, way past time, but.. yeah) to seriously think about how to pay for the inevitable medical needs that will arise over the next few years. \n\nTheir upcoming home sale is likely the last big windfall they’ll have in their lives (they keep playing the lotto, despite my constant urging otherwise), and I’ve taken on the task of maintaining/growing the proceeds from it. They both receive generous pensions/annuities/SSA that cover their monthly expenses fairly well. So what’s really needed is a way to maintain a nest egg to buffer the inevitable oncoming medical issues not covered by Medicare and Insurance. We’ve had some experience with this recently, and it’s not pretty.\n\nMy instinct is to open an account for them at Vanguard (this would be their first brokerage account, mind you), and drop it all into VTINX, the Vanguard post-retirement target date fund. But, given the tax implications of mutual funds, and the recent drama with unexpected taxes in the vanguard Target-date funds, I’m curious if the Bogleheads have a better idea. To wit: I could likely replicate VTINX’ allotment in a handful of equivalent ETFs. If I could get them to DCA from their disposable income each month, I might not have to create taxable events from rebalancing…\n\nSO: any advice on how to allot? Any advice on what kind(s) of accounts to use? Thanks as always!",
