I also have a brokerage with about 4k in an s&amp;p 500 index fund. I want to invest my 40k in savings but I'm nervous about locking up so much money. Its just been siting in my savings account for like a year. I worked so hard to save that much money up and I would hate to see it lose value. With the way the market been lately its made me nervous. I know in the long term markets tend to go up  but it still makes me nervous. I'm currently down on my S&amp;P index fund after contributing to it for almost a year. I guess my question would be how do you emotionally prepare yourself to lock up so much of your money?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your advice and thanks for commenting on my post :)",
