  "selftext": "Hi fellow bogleheads, this past weekend, after getting a hefty bonus at work, I have finally passed my first major milestone of 100k networth at 25 years old.\n\nSome high level information about me.\n\n\\- 25 Male\n\n\\- Degree in Computer Science, graduated in Spring 2020 making about 85k a year at my first gig.\n\n\\- Graduated with no debt, went to community college for a few years, then fast tracked the last 2 years of my degree in about a year and a half, a total of about 25k paid for by my parents, insurance money from an accident as a kid and 1 very small scholarship.\n\n\\- Currently working my 2nd job in tech where I make about 135k to 145k a year depending on bonuses.\n\nAnd here is some more detailed information about me.\n\nI started invested in a Roth IRA at 20 years old (2017) while I was still in undergrad, investing about 300 dollars a month into VOO (back when it was \\~$220 a piece, remember those days?).\n\nIn fall of 2018 I diversified my portfolio a bit to be in a few different sectors, I got a few funds such as VCR,VPU &amp; VGT and I still hold some quantity of those funds today.\n\nAll through undergrad I continued to invest what I could every month sometimes 300 and sometimes 600 or more depending on how much I worked/spent that month but I was always consistent and pretty much never missed a single month to sock away a couple hundred bucks. I was able to work 2 jobs some semesters and pretty worked all the last 2 years of undergrad, which coupled with living for free at home, was super helpful with my savings goals.\n\nWhen I graduated and was looking to move out, I decided to consolidate my accounts and make sure I had a clear view of my networth and from Day 1 of my career I have been investing anywhere from 15% to 27% of my income every month, watching it grow a ton since getting my first and then my 2nd big boy job.\n\nHere is my overall networth growth for the last 2 years, starting from about 18k when I opened this account to now about 102k.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ar632nvewwd91.png?width=955&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b84f527f5b16fb9f7ce85fce430ac1539661f66c\n\nHere is the general mix of my portfolio\n\nCash: 23k (mix of checking account , short terms savings, and emergency fund)401k: \\~19k (this is just for my current job which I have not been at very long)\n\nRoth IRA: 41k (a chunk of this is from a ROTH 401k rollover from my first job)\n\nTaxable Brokerage: 15k (about 2k of this are individual stocks my first job gave me as compensation)\n\nHSA: 3k\n\nWhen I started I had very clear headed people I followed online that spoke of passive investing as a way to get rich and nowadays it seems like the financial media is chock full of influencers using \\*\\*way\\*\\* too many buzzwords and over gamifying investing, which is not and has never been my style.\n\nI think this just goes to show that following the bogleheads' method is the way to go.\n\nI hope this posts shows someone out there, younger or older, that investing steadily and keeping track of how much you save can be seriously fruitful in the long run.\n\nI love some good tips so if anyone can maybe see where I should be doing better please let me know!",
