It was all very unexpected as it took forever for everything to be processed. The windfall was in the high six figures and I decided to deposit these funds in a new bank account so I could compartmentalize and avoid lifestyle creep with the account I use for my day to day life. \n\nWell the sum raised some eyebrows at this new bank and their financial advisors called me a few days after this deposit. At this point I had a taxable account and a Roth that I’d been making monthly contributions into. My AA was roughy 90/10 between VT and GOVT. I followed the sub and owned the book, so I knew I was going to be a passive investor for the long haul. But the much larger account kind of put some pressure on me that I’d never felt before. So I took a meeting with the financial advisor for this bank branch. \n\nI thought they may have some interesting points on taxes, asset allocations, or something interesting that I maybe hadn’t thought of before. \n\nI was dead wrong. I was basically presented with three plans. An advisor lead plan with their local guy, a bank lead plan with an all in one portfolio, and some front loaded mutual funds. The entire thing was just a sales pitch for high expense ratio products, the lowest being the bank lead mutual fund at about 1%. The financial advisor I was speaking with had a 1.5% fee and was actively trying to sell me on 5% front loaded funds. I kinda strung the meeting along a bit for my own curiosity, but I knew I wasn’t going to be paying these exorbitant fees. \n\nThat meeting was in February, I’ve taken the time since then to pay down all debt, max my tax advantaged accounts, and come up with an AA. I’m basically just going to DCA it all into a three fund over the next year. I’d planned for four equal installments, the first was going to be next Tuesday. Up until I got a call from this FA today. \n\nI let it go to voicemail. The jist of his message was that he could still see that I hadn’t invested any of the money in my account. “It’s not going to do anything sitting in cash. We have some very conservative options if you’re afraid of volatility.” \n\nI was planning on Tuesday anyhow so I figured I’d move my timeline up a few days as a bit of a middle finger to exorbitant fees and grifters if he could see my investment account. So I bought in today and now I feel great.\n\n$125,000\n\n55% VTI, 35% VXUS, 10% GOVT",
