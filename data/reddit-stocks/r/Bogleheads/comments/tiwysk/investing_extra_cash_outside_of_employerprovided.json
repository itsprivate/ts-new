Would it be wise to open up an IRA account with Vanguard to invest in a three-portfolio strategy on a less-than-normal basis? Deposits between those accounts would, be at most, ~$1,000 a month.\n\nI have most of a house down payment saved up, a 6 month emergency fund set up, paid off my car, and hold no debts.\n\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",
