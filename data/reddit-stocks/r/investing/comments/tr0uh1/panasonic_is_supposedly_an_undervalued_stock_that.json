While most other tech stocks are growing Panasonic has been forgotten and hasn't really grown at all. This is despite them being one of the biggest EV battery manufactures. They make the batteries for Tesla. This is largely due to them being seen as another Japanese tech company that operates in a ton of boring markets and make largely unexciting products. While this has been true in the past it might not be the case in the future:\n\n2. The company has just started a full restructuring. Instead of being in around 50 different markets (try going to their website), they plan to reduce to being in 15-20 markets that have growth potential (such as EV batteries). They also have new senior management and are planning to restructure the company into a \"western\" style holding company with different sub-companies (such as Google and Facebook has done with their Alphabet and Meta restructuring and rebranding). This gives them more options for starting new ventures and selling/spinning off other branches that do not benefit the group. This also allows them to separate their consumer and industry products more. They make everything from electric razors, to batteries, and to industrial automation. With the restructuring these different products will be more clearly managed under different companies and brands. \n\nWhat do you think? Is Panasonic a good value stock?",
