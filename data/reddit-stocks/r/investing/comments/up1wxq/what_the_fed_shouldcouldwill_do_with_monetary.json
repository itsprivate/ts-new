  "selftext": "Hello FinanceTLDR here again.\n\nBy now we should all agree that the Fed is tightening monetary policy. However, there is a lot of disagreement on what the Fed should/could/will do with monetary policy moving forward. And whatever they do end up doing will have huge implications on the overall market.\n\nSo today I want to give a quick sampling of all these conflicting opinions to help you make up your own mind about where the Fed is headed.\n\nLet’s start with overall market expectations.\n\n**Overall expectations**\n\nThe [Atlanta Fed projects](https://www.atlantafed.org/cenfis/market-probability-tracker) that the market expects a 3% Fed Funds Rate by the end of the year.\n\n**The Fed shouldn’t be raising rates**\n\nCarl Weinberg, High Frequency Economics Chief Economist &amp; Managing Director, went on Bloomberg recently talking about how the current inflation is caused by supply side constraints and not rising demand. This is because of energy prices raising much higher relative to other prices, which is actually deflationary since a lot of money is going into energy prices and less for discretionary consumption.\n\nThis creates a growth problem and hammering demand when the supply side is an issue will cause a lot more pain than is necessary. The Fed now should be cutting rates instead to keep investment flowing into alternative energy solutions.\n\n**The Fed can try to raise but won’t get there**\n\nJosh Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and regular CNBC contributor, mentioned in a recent The Compound podcast that he thinks 3% rates (market expectation) by year-end is too high. The Fed will try to raise to that level but something will break in the process and force the Fed to backtrack. This is similar to what happened in 2018 when overnight repo rates blew up forcing the Fed to reverse course and loosen monetary policy again.\n\n**Inflation is a demand side issue, the Fed needs to raise**\n\nMichael Darda, MKM Partners Chief Economist &amp; Macro Strategist, recently went on Bloomberg saying that inflation is actually a demand side issue and the Fed is right in raising rates. His reasoning is that supply side shocks can change the composition of GDP growth but not increase growth, and if we look at how GDP and inflation has overshot the previous trend, it appears demand side is causing about 60-70% of the overshoot. In this case, the Fed is right about raising rates.\n\nBill Dudley, former NY Fed President, also agrees that this inflation is caused by the demand, but he has a different take. He thinks that inflation is actually largely driven by a tight labor market that is causing real wages to actually fall behind inflation. The Fed therefore needs to cool off the labor market and this will cool off inflation as well. Dudley thinks a 4-5% Fed Funds Rate at year end is more reasonable, and 5-6% rate won’t surprise him.\n\n**Inflation is going to stay elevated. The Fed needs to be more aggressive**\n\nFinally, we have Jeremy Siegel, \n\nJeremy Siegel, Professor of Finance at the Wharton School, who recently went on CNBC to say that there is actually a lot of inflation that won’t show up in the CPI index until later (e.g. housing-related inflation) and we’re going to see an elevated CPI index for the next 6 to 9 months. Therefore, the Fed actually needs to be way more aggressive and do a 100 bps hike instead of a 50 bps hike as the next step up.\n\nThere’s a lot of conflicting opinions out there on what the Fed should do or will end up doing. Hopefully this is a good enough sampling of some of these opinions and you’ve found it useful in making your own mind up on what the Fed should/could/will do.",
