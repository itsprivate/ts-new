The cost of mapping a genome has fallen \\~100,000% over the last 15 years. Huge implications for companies in genetics, personalized healthcare, and healthcare platforms. Some examples of companies in the field: $DNA, $NVTA, $CRPR, $EDIT, $PACB\n2. College tuition has outpaced how much people earn by almost 10x. People are now looking for alternatives to college more than ever before. The pandemic has only accelerated this. Online education from sources such as YouTube or Coursera are ever more prevalent. Some examples of companies that could benefit from this: $COUR, $GOOG, $DUOL, $UDMY\n3. Cyber insurance loss ratios have increased for years, despite exponentially growing rates. Cyber security is ever more important. Examples of companies that could benefit from this: $CRWD, $OKTA, $NET, $FSLY\n4.  The percentage of men under 30 not having sex has tripled in the last \\~decade. Companies that could capitalize on this: $BMBL, $MTCH\n5. NY Times expects a shortage of semi-conductors by 2025. Most emerging technologies, such as EVs, AI, Gaming depend on semi-conductors. Companies that could take advantage: $AMD, $NVIDIA, $MU, $LRCX\n6.  As of 2020, Americans saved over 60m commute hours per day with remote work.  Assuming 5-day weeks, that's \\~16.3B (billion!) hours saved per year. Companies that could take advantage: $ZM, $DOCU, $BOX, $DBX, $TWLO\n7. The OG lab-grown burger costed $330k in 2013.  Now, 1lb of lab-grown chicken costs $7.70, down from $18 mid-2021. Companies in the sector: $BYND, Impossible Foods (likely to IPO soon)\n8. A new solar plant is now 3x cheaper than a new coal plant. Companies in the industry: $SEDG, $ENPH, $RUN\n\nObviously I have missed a lot of trends/companies within this short summary but would love to see which other trends people are looking at, and what companies specifically they're investing in to capitalize on these.",
