I hope you get something out of this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general:  In high interest rates, bonds do better and stocks do worse than in lower interest rates.  High interest rates means more difficulty growing. It also implies the risk free rate is high so bond yields must rise with it in order to have any demand for corporate paper.\n\nBasic Materials:\n\nThe interest rate to commodity price index is inverted.  This is because the demand for commodities falls with the level of economic activity.  This can be seen quite clearly by comparing a chart of interest rates with commodity prices.\n\nThe implications of high interest rates are divided across the industry.  Commodity producers will have more difficulty staying profitable and expanding operations.  Cash generation will be severely strained.  Commodity buyers on the other hand will find that expenses are much lower and it easier to get competitive prices.  There are some material producers that will suffer less than others.  In general, smaller companies suffer more because the larger ones are more capable of providing the most competitive prices.\n\nCommunication services:\n\nCommunications services do well in low interest rates, and tend to struggle in higher rates.  This sector is generally the most overpriced and most leveraged.  Stock prices in this sector may decrease more than the average market does.  In addition to lower stock prices, companies that require a lot of leverage will have difficulty expanding or continuing operations.  Established companies that have less capital intensive operations will fare much better, but still won’t be able to come up with the same revolutionary technologies that come from lower interest rate environments.\n\nTechnology:\n\nThis sector is unique because it is much newer and has not been exposed to high interest rates.  If the current environment of startups are extended, many startups will find difficulty finding funding and small companies with high debt will face similar problems.  For larger companies, a unique situation is presented.  These companies are known for constant acquisitions and with high interest rates, all of the talent in niche tech businesses will suddenly look much more attractive.\n\nIt is possible that the mega cap tech companies will be nearly unaffected because of their massive operating cash flows that are vital to normal life.  Many companies in tech have become very large with a low interest rate for the entirety of their existence.  It is possible that these companies suffer more than older companies of similar operations and size because of a lack of experience operating at higher interest rates.\n\nIndustrials:\n\nThese companies have mixed implications.  On one end, commodities and other material input are cheaper, but on the other end there is less demand for industrial products in an economic slowdown.  Revenue and cost of goods sold could be expected to decrease, creating smaller, more profitable businesses.\n\nA nice way to think about this is to examine the airplane manufacturing industry in a high interest rate environment.  The manufacturer can acquire the materials and possibly prefabs for the plane for cheaper.  The gross margin on the individual plane is higher as a result, but in the general economy, consumer activity is lower, so there is less traveling and a resulting lower demand for aircraft.\n\nHealth Care:\n\nHealth care is much less volatile than the average market because the demand for healthcare services is mostly disjoint from economic activity.  The main concerns in health care are shared with the rest of the economy - mostly issues arising in debt refinancing and upgrading or acquiring fixed assets.\n\nUtilities:\n\nUtilities generally underperform in high interest rates.  They take on more debt, require consistent servicing of fixed assets, and are slower to increase revenue than other industries.  When operating conditions are staying similar (utility costs for consumers are not increasing much) and interest rates are high, utilities have a much more difficult time covering capex and depreciation.\n\nConsumer staples:\n\nConsumer staples are historically less volatile than most of the market.  Consumers may not be buying luxury goods or a second home at high interest rates, but like healthcare, consumer staples are not things that are optional for most people.  \\[Most?\\] Consumers are not going to stop purchasing food and toiletries just because their variable rate debts are becoming more costly.\n\nFinance:\n\nFinance tends to do well in high interest rate environments.  They are able to write higher rate loans, and demand for loans increases.  Insurance historically issued higher premiums.  Financial firms can be viewed as the most obvious beneficiaries of high interest rates at the cost of most other industries.",
