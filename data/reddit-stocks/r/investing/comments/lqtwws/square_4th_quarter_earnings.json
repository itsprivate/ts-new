But would like to be invested in fintech.  Between Sq and Paypal was always more interested in Sq.  With the drop is now a good time to buy and hold?  Or is the valuation still too rich?  Numbers look solid imo.  The bitcoin purchase of 170 million doesn&#39;t seem that much in the grand scheme of things.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m Canadian and don&#39;t use cashapp or the Paypal version so ppl who use it and their opinions would be nice as well.  Or any other recommendations in the fintech space.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
