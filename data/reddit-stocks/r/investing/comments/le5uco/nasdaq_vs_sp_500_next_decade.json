You can generate massive margins with a smaller labor and capital investment given that software is built to scale.</p>\n\n<p>However, now you have to pay a big premium for tech. Really for any company to succeed in the 21st century they need to be able to harness and utilize modern technology, so even if a company isn&#39;t &#39;tech&#39; they need to be good at technology. It feels like many up and coming tech companies are being priced as next FANG potential when this probably not the case.</p>\n\n<p>Do you expect another decade of tech outperformance?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
