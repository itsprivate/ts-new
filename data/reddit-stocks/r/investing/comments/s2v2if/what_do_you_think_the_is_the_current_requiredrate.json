Most stocks these days seems to be paying less than 1% interest on their debt, sometimes a lot less. \n\nSo likely RRR is something above 1% and below 6%? \n\nA related question is: **how can you gauge the market average RRR in a simple way?** One idea I had was to look at the average dividend payout of US regional banks with little historic growth and little historic growth prospects. Presumably the main reason to own a stock like that is to get a dividend payout, and the market will bid up the price of these stocks until the dividend yield is below the RRR?\n\nA quick [screen](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=161&amp;f=fa_epsyoy_u10,fa_sales5years_u5,sec_financial&amp;ft=2) for this idea, shows that most such banks pay out no more than 3% dividend. \n\nSo likely RRR is probably closer to  3% rather than 6%?",
