Want to buy structured notes?\n\nThese kinds of \"complex\" investment products have exploded in popularity in the last several years, particularly as self-directed investors have been trading at home during Covid.\n\nHere's the bad news: Regulators are getting worried that you may be getting in over your head, and they seem to be looking to erect more \"guardrails\" to protect you against making stupid investments. They may even want you to take a test to prove you know what you're doing.\n\nThe recent market volatility is not helping, and likely making regulators even more nervous.\n\n### FINRA is sending a warning signal\n\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority(FINRA) , which is the regulator for all the brokerage firms and exchanges in the U.S., recently released [a regulatory notice](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/22-08) to its members (brokerage firms), reminding them of the risks of these \"complex\" products and the legal obligations they have of making sure their investors are in products that are suitable for them.\n\n\"The number of accounts trading in complex products and options has increased significantly in recent years,\" FINRA wrote in the note. \"However, important regulatory concerns arise when investors trade complex products without understanding their unique characteristics and risks.\"\n\nFINRA reminded its members that Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), which was adopted in 2020, requires brokers to act in the \"best interest\" of the customer when making such recommendations. That means brokers need to be able to explain to clients the nature of the product they are recommending and the potential risks and rewards, and to determine if these investments are \"suitable\" for the client.\n\n### FINRA wants broader rules on these products\n\nFINRA said it was seeking comments on whether the current regulatory framework is adequate to protect investors. It noted that the old rules were adopted when most financial products were bought through financial professionals, whereas today many of these products are bought and sold through self-direct trading platforms like Robinhood or other online brokers.\n\n\"This is clearly a stalking horse for a new piece of rulemaking,\" Dave Nadig, financial futurist at ETF Trends, told me.\n\n\"The SEC is concerned there is a new raft of retail investors who are under-educated about what they are doing,\" Nadig said.\n\n\"It is partly a reaction to retail investing in options, but it is even broader than that. They are proposing to create a class of new products called 'complex' that is basically everything besides plain vanilla stocks and bonds.\"\n\n### 'Complex' products could include your crypto ETF fund\n\nIn its note, FINRA describes a complex product as \"a product with features that may make it difficult for a retail investor to understand the essential characteristics of the product and its risks (including the payout structure and how the product may perform in different market and economic conditions).\"\n\nThese can include leveraged and inverse exchange-traded products, volatility-linked ETPs, structured products, and defined outcome ETFs, which offer exposure to the performance of a market index but with downside protection and an upside cap on potential gains over a specified period.\n\nAlso on the list: \"Mutual funds and ETFs that offer strategies employing cryptocurrency futures.\"\n\n\"We continue to believe that the features of these products are such that they may be difficult for a retail investor to understand the essential characteristics of the products and their risks and, are, therefore complex,\" FINRA said.\n\n\"These concerns may be heightened when a retail customer is accessing these products through a self-directed platform and without the assistance of a financial professional, who may be in a position to explain the key features and risks of the product to the retail investor.\"\n\nFINRA is doing more than warning about these products. It is asking if additional requirements are necessary to protect investors.\n\nIt is particularly concerned about the growth of \"self-directed platforms\" and asks, \"are additional guardrails needed for these types of platforms?\"\n\n### Should retail traders be required to take tests?\n\nFINRA also seems to want the retail investor to demonstrate a lot more knowledge of the products they are buying.\n\nFor example, it is asking whether retail customers should be required \"to demonstrate their understanding of those common characteristics and risks of complex products by completing a knowledge check and, if the customer fails to show the requisite knowledge, requiring the completion of a learning course and additional assessment?\"\n\nEssentially, FINRA is asking if retail traders should be required to pass a test before they can trade these products.\n\n### FINRA is also worried about plain-vanilla options trading\n\nEven the trading of options has become a source of concern. FINRA notes that listed options trading volume has grown to over 38.6 million contracts a day on average, 30% higher than 2020 and almost 100% higher than 2019.\n\n\"Similar to transactions in complex products, buying or selling options can be risky for retail investors who trade options without understanding their vocabulary, strategies and risks. Members should consider whether investors understand the various risks of trading options...\" FINRA said.\n\n[Source:](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/regulators-are-worried-that-retail-traders-are-getting-in-over-their-heads/ar-AAVzUgz?ocid=msedgdhp&amp;pc=U531&amp;cvid=f6d5481f037a49ba81c4924232afc0c0)",
