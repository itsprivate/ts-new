The collective output from those miners declined to 13.7 million ounces in 2020 from 15 million ounces in 2019.\n\nVinneth Bajaj, associate project manager at GlobalData, said: “After a strong first quarter in 2020, Newmont’s production was impacted by lower ore grades at the Ahafo, Yanacocha and Merian mines and the temporary suspension of the Cerro Negro, Yanacocha, Eleonore, Penasquito and Musselwhite mines between March and mid-May. In addition, the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie projects further reduced output.”\n\nLockdowns imposed by governments impacted gold production last year\n\nFor Barrick, several gold mines were forced to cease operations temporarily due to the government lockdowns imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus infections, including the Veladero, Pueblo Viejo and Porgera sites.\n\nMeanwhile, the divestment of African assets by AngloGold was a major factor behind the fall in the company’s output in 2020.\n\nRead the full article here: [https://digitalexploration.ai/gold-production-from-largest-miners-for-testing/](https://digitalexploration.ai/gold-production-from-largest-miners-for-testing/)",
