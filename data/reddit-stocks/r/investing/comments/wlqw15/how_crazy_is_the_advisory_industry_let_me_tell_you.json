I had a recent conversation with a friend of mine, who is about to retire.\n\nFidelity, which has its own advisory service is trying to earn his post retirement business.  Please note, there are a lot of people who have no desire to do their own investments, and are glad to hire someone else to do it for them.  By the way, the DALBAR study shows that those who have an advisor tend to outperform those who don't. [https://www.dalbar.com/Portals/dalbar/Cache/News/PressReleases/QAIB\\_PR\\_2022.pdf](https://www.dalbar.com/Portals/dalbar/Cache/News/PressReleases/QAIB_PR_2022.pdf)\n\nI asked him how much where they going to charge him.  His answer was 1.25%.  So, to manage his $2 million portfolio, they were going to charge him $25,000 per year to invest his money into mutual funds, which have their own fees. But remember, the advisory model is supposed to be better than the retail model.  I'm calling BS.\n\nFirst of all, any C share mutual fund would only charge 1.00% in the form of a contingent deferred sales charge. The advisor is paid 1% up front, but the client doesn't realize they charge until the end of the quarter (0.25%) or the end of the year. Obviously, this is far cheaper than 1.25% and would save my friend $5,000 per year.  Eventually, these C shares will convert to A shares where the 12b-1 fee is only 0.25%.  The conversion will happen after seven to 10 years depending on the mutual fund company.  [https://www.investmentnews.com/fund-industry-limits-c-share-investing-cutting-12b-1-fee-income-for-advisers-75737](https://www.investmentnews.com/fund-industry-limits-c-share-investing-cutting-12b-1-fee-income-for-advisers-75737)\n\nNow, onto the dreaded A share, where there is the potential for an upfront 5.25% charge, but that charge is reduced, in the form of breakpoints, depending on how much is invested.  For a client like my friend, his purchase would be free.  Now mind you, the advisor is still paid $20,000, and the purchase is only free as long as the client stays in the A share for one calendar year.  All the client pays is the 0.25% 12b-1 fee.  My friend's annual fee is now $10,000, instead of $25,000.\n\nYet, here we are with to constant \"fiduciary\" model where paying a fee as high as 1.35% for Edward Jones, and I have seen fees even higher (1.50%).  What makes this really sickening is that many advisory clients have not heard from their advisors during one of the worst years for investing since 1793. This refusal to do anything is what is called in the industry \"Reverse Churning\".  [https://www.kitces.com/blog/reverse-churning-in-advisory-accounts-problems-for-fiduciary-advisors/](https://www.kitces.com/blog/reverse-churning-in-advisory-accounts-problems-for-fiduciary-advisors/)\n\nMy suggestion to you is before you hire a financial advisor and they are only going to recommend mutual funds, ask them if they offer A share if you have $1 million or more, and consider C shares if your timeframe indicates that it would be more prudent.\n\nNow before you say, just buy indexed mutual funds, and skip the advisor, studies show that individuals are terrible when managing their own money. Additionally, a good advisor can determine your risk tolerance (everyone is aggressive until the market goes down), and use that information to allocate your assets based on your emotional reactions to the markets, and your financial needs.  Let's not forget that asset allocation determines a lot of the variability i.e. risk in one's portfolio, so don't underrate the importance of this step.  [https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/02/16/setting-the-record-straight-on-asset-allocation/](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/02/16/setting-the-record-straight-on-asset-allocation/)\n\nHire an advisor, compare the fees between the advisory model and the retail model, buy seven to eight well allocated mutual funds, and you will be fine.\n\nCaveat Emptor",
