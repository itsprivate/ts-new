The authors then forecast what Generation Z might expect to earn in the coming decades. To do this, they assume that the real return on equities will be equal to the inflation-adjusted return on a risk-free asset (represented by Treasury bills), which they estimate at -0.5%, plus a “risk premium” for buying equities of about 3.5%, for a real return of just 3%. For bonds, the authors assume the current, negative real yields on the index-linked variety. All of this adds up to annualised returns for Gen Z of a mere 2% on a 70:30 portfolio of stocks and bonds—not even a third of the historical return of the baby boomers (see chart). These guesses could prove too pessimistic, but perhaps not dramatically so.”</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the paywall, I can’t get past the first part if anyone happens to have an account and can post the full article in the comments. </p>\n\n<p>As a young investor, this isn’t too encouraging. What do you think? Just looking to start a general discussion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
