They didn&#39;t retreat last week when most of the market was red. SBLK has great finances and 121 vessels. INSW transports mainly oil and also shows profit . But these others that each have around 41 vessels also look attractive SB + GNK + DSX + EGL </p>\n\n<p>From Yahoo </p>\n\n<p>This has been an interesting week to be invested in dry bulk shipping. Over the past five trading days, Star Bulk stock has appreciated an impressive 18%, and Diana Shipping is up 30%. But Castor Maritime stock had more than doubled, until today&#39;s sell-off, rising an astonishing 130% in four days of trading.\nWhere&#39;s all this excitement coming from? To begin with, the Baltic Exchange Dry Index, which tracks charter rates for ships that carry dry bulk cargo such as coal, grain, and iron pellets, had been in free fall this year. It dropped from as high as 1,831 to just 1,323 on Feb. 3, a decline of 28% that didn&#39;t bode well for dry shipping profits. That free fall finally bottomed out just above 1,300, however, and has remained pretty steady since, which may be giving investors confidence that the worst is now over.  </p>\n\n<p>Adding to their confidence, on Tuesday, brokerage firm BTIG announced that, in its opinion, the cyclical oceangoing freight market is set to recover over the next two years as the global economy emerges from its recession.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
