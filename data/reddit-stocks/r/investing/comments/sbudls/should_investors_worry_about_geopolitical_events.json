This is meant to shed light on past geopolitical events and their affect on markets. The human tragedy already seen as a result the conflict is apparent, with over 15,000 deaths among Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists that have been fighting since 2015 (according to Reuters). \n\nRussia has built a troop count of over 100,000 at the border and NATO and its allies have begun shipping troops, weapons, and ammunition to the region. US an European leaders continue to assess their options after meetings with Kremlin leaders have went largely nowhere. Economic sanctions are likely should Russia continue on their path. Ukraine, a former Soviet bloc country, is on a path to joining NATO which Putin and Russia vehemently oppose. Russia still views Ukraine as an extension of Russia and wishes to keep Ukraine under their wing to avoid further NATO \"intrusion\" so close to their land. \n\nThe story is gaining more momentum in mainstream news, and effects have found their way to the jittery stock market, but with the recent sell-off, the story has remained somewhat on the backburner in financial circles. \n\nAs tensions escalate, I thought it would be useful to put together a few data points on how markets have reacted to past geopolitical events. \n\n**State Street examined 71 geopolitical events from 1986-2018.** The full study is [here.](https://www.ssga.com/investment-topics/general-investing/2018/09/does-geopolitics-affect-financial-markets.pdf) A few takeaways include:\n\n\\- The largest effects seen were in currency and equity markets.\n\n\\- Equity markets typically respond quickly in a strong negative/positive fashion and remain depressed/elevated for about 1-2 months. As seen in the [chart](https://imgur.com/c7ryJ1e), the initial reaction is quite dramatic, but markets tend to rationalize as more clarity comes\n\n\\- [Volatility](https://imgur.com/GQxNpPP) and risk tend to spike right away as well, following both positive and negative events, only to recede slightly a month after the event \n\n**BlackRock also publishes a \"Geopolitical Risk Indicator\" found** [here](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/interactive-charts/geopolitical-risk-dashboard). The indicator is aimed to measure not the potential for geopolitical conflict, but the market's *attention* to geopolitical risks. \n\nBlackRock's [indicator](https://imgur.com/xVv6Az2) has been negative for the last year, indicating investors have not been paying much attention to geopolitical risks since Biden took office, and perhaps it's too little attention. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe data here is from two companies and is not all-encompassing, but it suggests riding out geopolitical risks may be better for long-term performance if you can withstand the short-term volatility that comes with it. The media will likely create significant panic if this situation continues to escalate, and rightfully so from a humanitarian perspective, but keeping your focus long-term may be beneficial for your portfolio. \n\nTL;DR: Unless Russia and the US move to an all-out war, the Ukrainian conflict is likely to have little long-term effect on global equity markets.",
