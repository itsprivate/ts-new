It has happened and will continue to happen for as long as the stock markets exist. </p>\n\n<p>However, no matter the market conditions, the fundamentals and logic behind investing should not change. Here is a little quote from the timeless &quot;the intelligent investor&quot; book.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>An investor calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of its businesses. A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price because somebody else will pay even more for it. As Graham once put it, investors judge “the market price by established standards of value,” while speculators “base [their] standards of value upon the market price.” For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes is like oxygen; cut it off and he dies. For an investor, what Graham called “quotational” values matter much less. Graham urges you to invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To all fellow investors, have fun and invest smartly.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: </p>\n\n<p>Getting a lot of flak from some users because apparently it seems as though I’m implying that traditional value investing is the only true way.</p>\n\n<p>This is not my point. There is a wide spectrum between speculation and investing. There is skilled speculation as there is skilled investing. Likewise, there is unskilled speculation and unskilled investing. </p>\n\n<p>My reminder to all is simple.</p>\n\n<p>If the speed limit is 100km/h and you so decide to drive at 300km/h, my reminder is please know that you are speeding, be careful at the bends, have both hands on the steering wheel, wear your seatbelt and keep your eyes extra wide. Is driving at 300km/h necessarily bad, if you were a skilled Formula 1 driver? Probably not. It is, however, incredibly dangerous if you just came out of driving school. That is my point. Too many investors these days are speeding because everyone else is, thinking they are driving safely. Without any precautions, plans or skill, your risk of crashing and burning is incredibly high. Right now, we are on a straight road and I don’t know how far the straight road extends, but when it gets bumpy and winding, how sure are you that the same speed that is getting you to your destination quicker, isn’t going to be the same speed that kills you?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
