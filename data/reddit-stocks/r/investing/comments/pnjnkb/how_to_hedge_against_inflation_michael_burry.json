  "selftext": "This is the second installment to a post I made back in May that documented some of my inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's 13F plays. People on other subs found the information in part 1 useful so I thought I'd make a part 2 specifically for the broader audience on r/Investing.\n\nBy my estimate, 28.4% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio is currently hedging against inflation. I arrived at this number by going through the individual positions of Scion's Q2 2021 13F, using the \"Think Back\" function in ThinkOrSwim to estimate options contracts prices, and summing the resulting positions together.\n\n# US 20+ year Treasury ETFs (7.6% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio)\n\nBurry's treasury instrument of choice is the 20+ year bond. This is a direct play on inflation where he's essentially concluding that the Fed will eventually need to raise interest rates which will lead to an increase in bond yields thereby causing their prices to fall. TLT is tied to the bond price itself. TBT is tied to the inverse of the yield (so when the yield falls, TBT goes up 2x that rate (in theory)).\n\nHe has positions in both TLT and TBT (see below for descriptions). It should be noted that both of these positions first appeared in Scion's 13F in Q1 2021. It should also be noted that he reduced his TBT position and increased his TLT position in Q2 2021. His TLT position is the third largest position in his Q2 2021 portfolio (which, in my opinion, says something about which ETF he prefers).\n\n**Put Options on** [Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)](https://investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) **- 7.2% of current holdings**\n\nProbable Burry thesis: rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates, leading to increased yields and making these 20 year bonds less attractive.\n\nSome context: The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds (link).\n\n**Call Options on** [Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treas etf (TBT)](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) **- 0.4% of holdings**\n\nProbable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on a 2x inverse bond ETF.\n\nContext: The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).\n\n# Energy, Commodities, and Transport (11% of current holdings)\n\nCommodities are a fairly traditional inflation play. This [article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020816/importance-commodity-pricing-understanding-inflation.asp) on investopedia gets into some of the details regarding the relationship between commodities and inflation. The challenge with each of these companies is determining whether the company is an explicit hedge against inflation or whether it’s a value investing play.\n\n[Ovintiv Inc.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ovintiv-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-and-operating-results-301342593.html) **(Pan Canadian Energy - Encana Corp.) (OVV) - 4.06% of current holdings**\n\nThis is the 6th largest Scion position and the 2nd largest shares-only position (i.e., no options contracts).\n\nProbable Thesis: First, it's an oil & gas company (meaning the commodities checkbox is checked on this one). Second, it's arguably a riskier investment at the moment. They have very little cash on the balance sheet (enough for 1 day of operations). They are currently redirecting their cash flow towards paying down long-term debt which in itself is another positive for inflationary times (one group that does particularly well during inflation is debtors as the debt inflates itself away).\n\n[Scorpio Tankers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4438157-scorpio-tankers-has-more-upside) **(STNG), SunCoke Energy (SXC), and** [Golden Ocean Group Limited](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOGL) **(GOGL) - 2.9%, 2.4%, and 1.7%**\n\nI grouped these positions together as they each clock in below 3% of the overall portfolio. Each of these was also an existing position that Burry added to in Q2 2021.\n\n***Scorpio Tankers and Golden Ocean Group***\n\nThese two are likely plays on ocean freight/transport inflation. Scorpio is tied to oil transport and is a proxy play on any boost to oil demand that occurs at the global level. Golden Ocean Group looks similar but tied specifically to dry bulk goods.\n\n***SunCoke Energy***\n\nThis is the one that I'm leaning more towards \"value investing play\" and less towards inflation (but I could be wrong). The arguments in favor of it being an inflation play are that it’s a commodity company (coal), it just recently started paying a dividend, and its been working towards deleveraging (at least that was the case earlier in the year). These are themes that you'll see in other investments such as CVS Health below.\n\n# Revenue Mammoths (9.8% of current holdings)\n\nThe final group of companies are the revenue mammoths. They hail from the retail, grocery, and pharmacy sectors. All four of these organizations are in the top 31 companies in the world by revenue. They have some combination of pharmaceutical distribution and retail/grocery. They offer dividends with two of them being dividend aristocrats.\n\n**CVS Health (Call Options and Shares) - 4.7% of portfolio**\n\nInterestingly, CVS Health is the only stock where Burry is currently holding both shares and call options. They are the [7th largest company in the world by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue) (hence the revenue mammoth term).\n\nThe characteristics that make CVS an interesting potential inflation play are:\n\n• They have a large pharmaceutical distribution presence\n\n• They have a large health insurance segment\n\n• They have a sizeable retail store segment\n\n• They froze their dividend in 2018 to pay down debt related to their Aetna acquisition\n\nWhat makes these intriguing characteristics from the inflation perspective?\n\nHealthcare and pharmaceuticals have consistently beaten inflation over the past several decades. Pharmaceutical drugs continue to trend up. CVS owns a pharmacy benefits manager which, as a business, is incentivized through proportional rebates to push pricier drugs where they can.\n\nFrom the retail perspective, their \"front\" stores are essentially baskets of goods which can pass on the costs of inflation to the consumer.\n\nLastly, the most intriguing reason (in my opinion) is their current strategy to pay down long-term debt. Their stock price is arguably depressed due to the massive $69 billion acquisition of Aetna they made in 2018. They had been increasing dividends every year for almost 2 decades before this acquisition, at which point they froze the dividend and put the money towards their debt. They estimate that they'll hit their debt-to-capitalization ratio in Spring of next year (I personally think it will be summer or fall of next year). At that point, it is anticipated that they will resume dividend hikes and share buybacks as they've done historically.\n\nWith CVS, you have a potential case where the 7th largest company in the world by revenue is undervalued due to a large amount of debt that they are slowly and steadily paying off in an advantageous inflationary environment with a predicted return to hiking their dividends in 2022 (and they appear to be largely inflation-proof).\n\n**The Opioid Twins: McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health (Call Options only) - 2.9% of portfolio**\n\nTwo more pharmaceutical revenue mammoths: McKesson clocks in at #12 on the largest companies by revenue list and is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States. They also own a chain of 4000 pharmacy stores. Cardinal Health clocks in at 14th by revenue and is in the top 5 largest pharmaceutical distributors with McKesson. Both offer similar inflation characteristics to the ones listed for CVS Health with the difference being that CVS owns a health insurance plan on top of their pharmacy retail/PBM businesses.\n\nAnother key difference between CVS Health and the duo of McKesson and Cardinal is that McKesson and Cardinal Health were penalized in July of 2021 for their role in the Opioid crisis. Cardinal Health [expects to pay $6.4 billion over 18 years](https://www.dispatch.com/story/business/2021/07/22/cardinal-health-pay-6-4-billion-part-opioid-settlement/8053626002/) for its share of a $26 billion opioid settlement. It's possible that this legislation is currently a drag on these two stocks.\n\n**Walmart (Call Options only) - 1% of portfolio**\n\nWalmart is an interesting case because, at first glance, it appears to make more sense as an inflation play than the rest of this mammoth revenue group. Walmart is the largest company on Earth by yearly revenue. They have a strong pharmaceutical presence like the other companies in this category though over half of their revenue is actually from their grocery segment.\n\nWhat makes them an interesting inflation play is that their stores are literally giant baskets of goods. They have a large breadth of products which allows them to keep the prices of various product categories lower than their competitors. They also own the basket that the goods live in (along with the land around the basket). Real Estate is a well-known inflation hedge.\n\nThanks for reading.",
