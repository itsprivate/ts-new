I have a taxable account that I use for options and speculative plays, another for long term investment in growth stocks I select, a Roth IRA I max contributions to annually, and a savings account with about 6 months worth of salary in it. \n\nMy question is this: back when the interest rate on my savings account was 2%+ I didn’t mind having so much money in it but now that rate has dropped to 0.5% and is not keeping up with inflation. What are the opinions on keeping a months salary in a savings account and putting the rest in a portfolio composed of 40% IVOL, 30% VTI, and 30% ICVT? I understand the risk of not remaining liquid in an emergency so ideally, it would be a margin account allowing my funds to clear immediately if I needed to liquidate. I could rely on lines of credit as well if I needed to wait for funds to clear and pay it off before interest starts accruing. This account would contain 3-6 months worth of living expenses and an additional 30% buffer. Unless this account were to drop in excess of 30%, my emergency fund would not take a hit. Thoughts on this or alternative portfolio compositions?",
