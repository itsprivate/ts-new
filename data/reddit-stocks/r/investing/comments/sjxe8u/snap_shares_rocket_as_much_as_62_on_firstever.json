Snap fell 23.6% Thursday prior to its own earnings announcement but popped as much as 62% after hours, before settling up about 52%.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nEarnings per share: 22 cents, adjusted vs 10 cents expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analystsRevenue: $1.3 billion vs $1.2 billion, according to RefinitvGlobal Daily Active Daily Users (DAUs): 319 million vs 316.9 million, according to StreetAccountAverage Revenue per User (ARPU): $4.06 vs $3.79, according to StreetAccount\n\nIt also provided a Q1 guidance range of $1.03 billion to $1.08 billion, higher than the $1.01 billion analysts anticipated, according to Refinitiv. It expects daily active users between 328 million and 330 million in the first quarter, beating analyst estimates of 327.8 million, according to StreetAccount.\n\nSnap has to contend with similar headwinds as Meta, which warned that it anticipates a $10 billion revenue hit in 2022 resulting from Apple’s privacy changes on iOS that make it harder to target consumers with advertiser content.\n\nSnap also distributes its app on Apple iPhones and serves advertising content to monetize its business. But Snap’s direct response advertising businesses experienced a recovery from the iOS changes “quicker than we anticipated,” according to prepared remarks for CFO Derek Anderson for the company’s analyst call.\n\nDuring the Q&amp;A period, Andersen said that Snap has been mindful to make privacy inherent to its products and as a result, the changes caused by the iOS changes are “likely to be experienced differently for our business than perhaps for others.”\n\nStill, Anderson said in his opening comments that Snap still thinks “it will take at least a couple more quarters for our advertising partners to build full confidence in our new measurement solutions.”\n\nChief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman said in her prepared remarks that the sales team is helping advertisers transition through the changes. Gorman said advertisers who tend to focus on “lower funnel goals” like in-app purchases have been most impacted and some have migrated to “mid-funnel goals” like installs or clicks, where there’s greater visibility despite the iOS changes.\n\nAndersen also pointed to macroeconomic forces like supply chain disruptions and labor challenges impacting advertisers and impacting Snap’s brand advertising sector, specifically.",
