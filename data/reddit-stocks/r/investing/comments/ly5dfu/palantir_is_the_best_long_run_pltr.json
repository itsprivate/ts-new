Essentially these two software work by integrating with the customer&#39;s existing system and simulating different operational models and outcomes for different decisions that the customer makes. To me, this technology is revolutionary as proven by how unpredictable the state of the world economy is right now. </p>\n\n<p>A few of the big names that are working with them now is <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>PG&amp;E</strong>, <strong>BP</strong>, and many hedge funds and banks, and a big one recently is a 31m contract with <strong>NHS England</strong> where they are working to handle vaccine allocation <strong>(</strong>this is significant as the UK is facing a historically tough recession<strong>)</strong></p>\n\n<p>They have been consistently working with the US government on multiple contracts using Gotham, from finding bin Laden to verifying Iran&#39;s nuclear presence in 2018. Palantir is <strong>one of the four</strong> institutions that were given DoD IL-5 and on their way to DoD IL-6, to give you a scale Google is DoD IL-2 and Oracle is DoD IL-4, meaning they are responsible for handling extremely sensitive information for the DOD, their most recent contract is <em>project Maven</em>. Essentially Palantir is the CIA&#39;s AI twin.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back at the fundamentals, especially with the P/S ratio of over 40 right now, it can be overpriced to get in. But in the near future, PLTR will be the best stock to hold for 5+ years as the sky is their limit.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: forgot to put my position 300 @24.9</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
