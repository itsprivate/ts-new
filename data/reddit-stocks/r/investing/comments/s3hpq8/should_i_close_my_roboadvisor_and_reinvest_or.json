Fast forward to now and I find it entirely too conservative for my goals. I'd like to have my money in something closer to an 80/20 S&amp;P500/international ETF mix without all the cash and bonds found in SIP. \n\nHere's my question though, does it make more sense to just sell everything in my SIP, pay the capital gains and invest into ETFs or to try to avoid the tax, cease contributing to SIP, let what is there continue to slowly grow, and just start fresh into ETFs? The tax bill wouldn't break me by any means but I'm not sure the smart move is to pay unnecessary taxes on something that technically is still performing. Any advice is appreciated.
