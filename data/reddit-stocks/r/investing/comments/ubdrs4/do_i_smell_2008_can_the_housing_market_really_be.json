I'm based in Europe and we are seeing ridiculous housing prices.\n\nMy house was just valued at a crazy amount and there seems to be nothing on the market.\n\nI'm in Slovakia which is bordering Ukraine so there is also  an increased demand from Ukrainians who want to buy or rent l.\n\nI've been contacting real estate agencies for both rent and for sale. The arrogance is unbelievable. When I call, they simply reply an SMS with the prices and ask if I want it without even viewing.\n\nSo, I took a look at bankruptcies in the EU and they are down!\n\nInterest rates are at about 1 - 1.5% here at the moment but I've seen they are creeping up. I'm sure, when there is a 2 or 3 percent increase, people will start defaulting. \n\nWe are thinking to sell our house and just rent for a few years because this feels like a bubble. We will keep watching the market and try to buy land, or maybe a mixed bag of properties. \n\nNow, I know we can't really predict the market but could anyone suggest some indicators I could check? How do you make decisions regarding real estate investments?\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, when I say 2008, I mean just housing crashing part. I have quite a good understanding of the 2008 financial crash, and it is understood that the reason for the next crash is very unlikely to be for any of those reasons, I mean more in regards the outcome of such a crash - houses being sold a fire sale prices, defaults.etc.",
