All these posts always seem to ignore valuation and they rarely make an effort to justify the valuations of the companies they preach. It’s easy so say that a company will grow sales 25% year over year for the next decade, but if the company trades a 100x P/S then what good is it? The market has already priced in the high growth of these companies. You cannot make money betting on something already priced in. In order to think the stock is a good investment, you have to expect it to grow more than what the market currently expects. A lot of people don’t seem to make that connection. They just say “company do good = stock go up.” I have no doubt that all these hyper growth stocks like TSLA will be much larger in 10 years than they are today. That doesn’t make it a good investment because the market is already expecting absurdly high growth and so that is factored into the stock price. Many companies grew substantially over a certain period of time despite their stock suffering. An easy example is Microsoft in 1999. Was Microsoft a better company in 2009 than in 1999? Microsoft had revenue that was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999. Despite this, the stock was down over 50% during that timeframe. The simple fact is that it doesn’t matter how great a company is if you overpay for that company. Keep that in mind the next time you are analyzing hyper growth stocks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
