Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 838,000 applications in the latest week.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Gross domestic product increased at a 4.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth. That was a slight upward revision from the 4.0% pace reported last month. The economy grew at a record 33.4% rate in third quarter.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;The economy’s struggles in the final three months of 2020 are mostly in the rear view mirror. The sharp rebound retail sales and President Joe Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion recovery package, which is gaining traction in the U.S. Congress, have prompted economists to boost their first-quarter growth estimates to as high as a 6% rate from as low as a 2.3% pace.&#39;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
