  "selftext": "Hello FinanceTLDR here again,\n\nI spent the last few days reviewing Fed commentary and here’s what I gleaned about what the Fed is really worried about.\n\nMost of us know the Fed is targeting inflation at 2%. Actual inflation is way higher than that.\n\nThe Fed used to think it’s transitory, but have greatly changed their tune and thus policy projections in the last few months.\n\nHere’s why.\n\nThere is an economic concept known as the Wage-Price Spiral where rising wages (e.g. from a tight labor market) increases business expenses and thus business raise prices. This increases inflation and workers demand more wages. The increased wages then increase inflation. And the cycle goes on and on causing sustained inflation and unstable prices.\n\nThe Fed right now is worried that inflation isn’t transitory because of a wage-price spiral.\n\nThe most dangerous thing about the wage-price spiral is that it’s based off of people’s expectations on wages and inflation and is very sticky and hard to stop when it starts. There is historical precedent of this in the 70s and 80s.\n\nHere’s a direct quote from JPow about it in the last FOMC press conference: “It's a risk that we simply can't -- we can't run that risk. We can't allow a wage price spiral to happen. And we can't allow inflation expectations to become unanchored. It's just something that we can't allow to happen. And so we'll look at it that way.”\n\nJPow also mentioned several times wages are rising too quickly, and the labor market is super super tight.\n\nAnother quote: “Wages are running high, the highest they've run in quite some time. And they are one good example of or good illustration really of how tight the labor market really is. The fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades. And that's because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market. So we think through our policies, through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in we'd like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance. And that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with two percent inflation. That's our expectation.”\n\nJPow also blames the super strong labor market on strong consumer demand. Thus it’s appropriate to use Fed’s tools to lower demand to weaken labor market, and thus weaken inflation.\n\nAs such, we can expect the Fed to start easing off from tightening if the labor market starts cooling off. One of the key metrics there would be vacancies to unemployed person. Right now this is at 1.9, a historic high. JPow mentioned that he’d feel more comfortable with that number at 1.\n\nAnd it may very well be the case that the labor market cooling is a leading indicator of inflation, so watch labor market numbers closely to get ahead of Fed policy announcements.\n\nFinally, JPow also mentioned in the last FOMC press conference that he’s not afraid to bring the economy into a recession if that’s what it takes to avoid a wage-price spiral. So it is clear that this Fed prioritizes price stability over employment and will tank employment if that means fighting off entrenched inflation.\n\nHope this was helpful in shedding some more light into exactly what the Fed is thinking and worried about.\n\nYou can read the full press conference transcript here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20220504.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20220504.pdf)",
