He claims that economy has entered a new cycle, which is expected to continue for years, not months. I know this is not new,  and there are multiple other resources that share this belief. What was interesting to me about this podcast was that although the rise in the markets is high, it is exactly what happened in the beginning of the last cycle.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking back to the prior economic cycle, it&#39;s interesting to note that the S&amp;P 500 is tracking almost exactly what it did coming out of that recession, up about 80% over 10 months. Back then, the S&amp;P 500 then entered a long consolidation, during which it made little progress over the next eight months before resuming higher. While past is not always prologue, it can be a good guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So what do you think? Is this a beginning of a new economic cycle and are we about to enter a consolidation phase, while we wait for the profits of the companies to catch up with the stock markets expectations and normalize to a lower P/E ratio?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
