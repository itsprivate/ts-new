  "selftext": "I work in the biotech field and want to lay out why the 2022 biotech sell-off has created an unparalleled opportunity to buy cheaply into technology leaders in a growing field. Specifically, I want to talk about two companies involved in DNA sequencing: the US-listed Pacific Biosciences ($PACB) and the UK-listed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (LON:$ONT). These are household names for people working in biotech but not widely known outside of the field. I will refer to them as PacBio and ONT in the main text below.\n\n**TL;DR:** PacBio and ONT are significantly undervalued leaders in long read DNA sequencing. Together they hold a duopoly in the long read sequencing market, with sizable technology-based moats that even the sequencing Goliath Illumina ($ILMN) with 80% market share has never been able to overcome. In the last 6 months, PacBio has lost 80% of its value and ONT has lost 45% of its value, providing excellent entry points. Bucking the stock price decline, in 2021, revenues grew 65% for PacBio and 94% for ONT as these companies scale up. Together PacBio and ONT own less than a 10% share of the DNA sequencing market, which is currently worth $5.8B. But both their market share as well as the total addressable market are likely to grow rapidly over the next ten years. Going long on PacBio and ONT therefore has a high probability of yielding a 10X return on investment.\n\n# What is DNA sequencing?\n\nFor those who went to school before the Human Genome Project started in 1990 and those who forgot their high school biology, DNA sequencing is the process of reading out the nucleic acid sequence of a molecule of DNA. You know that stuff inside all of our cells which encodes our genetic blueprint. Importantly, this DNA is rich in valuable information. Some of the most important types of information we can extract from DNA sequence are:\n\n* genetic mutations that contribute to disease like cancer and other traits\n* genetic relationships to other sequences (i.e., who’s the father, or which kind of virus is this?)\n\nIt’s useful to remember that roughly [half of common diseases](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.1684https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.1684), and [most rare diseases,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6279436/) are heritable. For example, the risk of cystic fibrosis and breast cancer is well understood to be passed down from parents to their children. In cancer patients, different types of tumors also have different types of characteristic DNA mutations that can be [screened and diagnosed with DNA sequencing](https://humgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40246-019-0220-8). As we've probably all read in the last few years, DNA sequencing has also been crucial for tracking the evolution of SARS-CoV2 and its variants. The bottom line here is that DNA sequencing provides vital information for improving public health. Information that governments, insurance providers and hospitals are willing to pay good money for. For those outside of the world of biology, I cannot understate how fast biotechnology and precision medicine are developing and how fundamental DNA sequencing is for that.\n\n# What is the total addressable DNA sequencing market?\n\nThe DNA sequencing market had a size of [$5.8B in 2021](https://investor.pacificbiosciences.com/events-and-presentations). Together with the development of precision healthcare and genetic surveillance of pathogens, this market is expected to grow at a fast clip. Though I don’t put much stock into exact predictions, some reports put the DNA sequencing market compound annual growth rate at [\\&gt;10% from 2020 to 2027](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/dna-sequencing-market#:~:text=The%20global%20DNA%20sequencing%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20grow%20at,USD%2011.21%20billion%20by%202027). The key thesis here is that not too far in the future, it will become routine healthcare policy to sequence and securely store the DNA of most individuals in developed countries. On top of that, I and others expect that sending tumor biopsy samples for sequencing and surveilling wastewater and other environments by sequencing will become routine, greatly expanding the sequencing market. Because DNA sequencing is a fundamental step in lots of modern biotech labs, one way to view DNA sequencing companies is as a pick-and-shovel play on the biotech sector. PacBio estimates a [$40B+ total addressable market for DNA sequencing](https://investor.pacificbiosciences.com/static-files/9ee0d712-6974-4c44-83e9-5af75541add3) and I think that’s realistic considering today’s trends.\n\n# What’s the competitive landscape in DNA sequencing?\n\nDNA sequencing is not a crowded field, with only a handful of companies playing a significant role. One reason for this is that, similarly to the semiconductor industry, the sequencing industry has a high barrier to entry due to technological complexity. Illumina ($ILMN) remains the 600 pound gorilla in the DNA sequencing space with a market cap of 50B and [2021 revenues of $4.5B](https://investor.illumina.com/news/press-release-details/2022/Illumina-Reports-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=Fiscal%20year%202021%20consolidated%20results,%243%2C239%20million%20in%20fiscal%202020). This translates roughly to a market share of 80% based on the estimated size of the 2021 market. With revenues of [$130M for PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/pacbio-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results-3/) and [$177M for ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/preliminary-results-year-ended-31-december-2021-guidance-update-0), these companies are the Davids to Illumina’s Goliath. Today, PacBio commands a market cap of only $1.5B and ONT is in a similar but more highly valued ballpark of $3.5B. Despite the fact that PacBio has been around since 2004 and ONT since 2005, they have not yet had a significant impact on Illumina’s dominance.\n\nThere are a few other companies worth mentioning to get the full picture, though I consider them less important for this thesis. In China, MGI is a large sequencing provider that reverse engineered Illumina’s technology and remains banned from the US market and has not penetrated the European market. One of the biggest biotech instrument producers Thermofisher ($TMO) makes the IonTorrent DNA sequencer, but it’s not competitive on price or data quality so is rarely used. There are also two new US companies (Singular Genomics $OMIC and the private Elements Biosciences) that will be launching sequencing instruments similar to Illumina’s in the next year or so. For those interested in more details, Keith Robinson is a scientist with a [great blog](http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/) on these and other sequencing technologies.\n\n# Why do we need long reads from PACB and ONT?\n\nWhen comparing sequencing technologies, the three main quality metrics we care about are sequence length (measured in bases), sequence accuracy and the cost per sequenced base. The longer, the more accurate, and the cheaper a sequence is, the better. I should state here that fundamentally, Illumina, PacBio and ONT use completely distinct sequencing technologies, each with some individual advantages. What makes PacBio and ONT unique compared to all the other sequencing companies is their *long reads*. All other technologies are based on *short reads*. As someone who has worked a lot with sequencing data, I can tell you that here size matters. Without getting too technical, DNA sequences from Illumina and the other sequencing companies are usually 50-500 bases in length while PacBio gives lengths around 10,000 bases and ONT comes packing 10,000-30,000 bases (sometimes up to several million bases).\n\nBut why do we care about the sequence length, you ask? Well imagine the DNA sequences are pieces of a puzzle. The difference in getting answers from long read sequencing data and short read sequencing data is like the difference between putting together a 10 piece puzzle and a 100 piece puzzle. Not only that, the short read puzzle is usually missing 10% of its pieces. The reasons for this are technical and related to long stretches of repetitive sequence that make it hard to get the whole picture with short reads. There are notable exceptions where long reads are not needed, including liquid biopsy where we are sequencing short fragments of cancer DNA often less than 200 bases in length. But what matters is that for most applications, when using Illumina data, there’s a moderate amount (perhaps [roughly 25%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929722000659)) of genetic variation that remains hidden. Some of this hidden variation can cause disease. For example, Evan Eichler, a well-known scientist at the University of Washington, emphasized in a recent article that 34% of all disease-causing variation is made up of variants that are [larger than a single base change](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6681822/), which are more difficult to detect with short reads. We can conclude that long reads offer critical advantages over short reads in clinical and other applications.\n\n# How cost-competitive are long reads?\n\nThe extra length of ONT and PacBio does come at a cost. The key cost metric is the price of a human genome (typically at 30x coverage, which means you sequence each base 30 times on average to make sure you don’t miss anything). Cost estimates can vary widely but sequencing expert [Albert Villela](https://twitter.com/AlbertVilella) has put together [a public tabular comparison of different providers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMMfhyLK0-q8XkIo3YxlWaZA5vVMuhU1kg41g4xLkXc/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=1569422585), from which I extracted some ballpark ranges.\n\n|*Sequencing provider*|*Cost per human genome*|\n|:-|:-|\n|Illumina/MGI|$1,000-$6,000|\n|ONT|$2,000-$6,000|\n|PacBio|$5,000-$40,000|\n\nAlthough I have to stress that cost estimates vary a lot, clearly Illumina has a lead on cost. However, if we are making clinical decisions affecting people’s health, arguably we healthcare providers may pay a premium to make sure they get the most complete possible information. On top of this, the cost of ONT and PacBio have come down considerably in the last few years and their pace of innovation here has outstripped Illumina. ONT actually reported in their 2021 annual results that they can already generate [a $345 human genome](https://nanoporetech.com/sites/default/files/s3/investors/reports/ONT%20FY21%20Results%20Presentation%20FINAL%2022.3.22.pdf) and are developing a system to go as low as $235, which would be groundbreaking if this translates to prices for users on the ground.\n\nI like to think of Illumina as similar to Intel: a long time market monopolist with juicy margins ([Illumina gross margin 69% for the last four years](https://ycharts.com/companies/ILMN/gross_profit_margin), nice) that has lost its innovative edge and kept iterating on the same short read sequencing technology. ONT has already come dangerously close in cost to Illumina, and has a real chance of becoming cheaper than Illumina in future.\n\n# Long read accuracy - still the Achilles heel?\n\nWe need to now talk about sequence accuracy. What is this? Just like us humans, all sequencing methods make mistakes. These take the form of incorrect bases in the DNA sequence, like typos in a text. For many applications a few errors don’t matter, but when we care about detecting very specific genetic mutations related to disease, we want to avoid even a small number of errors. In the past, Illumina and others have downplayed the threat from long read sequencing by citing its lower sequence accuracy. And until recently it was uncommon to use PacBio or ONT data alone because you needed additional Illumina data to correct the mistakes in the long reads. In the last few years, this has changed as PacBio introduced high-fidelity HiFi reads and [ONT introduced its latest Kit 14 chemistry and duplex sequencing](https://nanoporetech.com/sites/default/files/s3/investors/reports/ONT%20FY21%20Results%20Presentation%20FINAL%2022.3.22.pdf). Illumina no longer has a monopoly on accurate high-throughput reads as the table below shows and [a recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.466057v2.full) nicely lays out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|*Sequencing provider*|*Sequencing accuracy*|\n|:-|:-|\n|Illumina/MGI|99.9%|\n|ONT|95%-99.9%|\n|PacBio|98%-99.9%|\n\nAll these error rates seem low, but remember when you sequence a human genome with 6.4 billion bases, a 99.9% error rate means 6.4 million errors. Even a 0.01% improvement is therefore a big deal. There is some fineprint to the table above and its based on manufacturer numbers and my own experience with the data and reading of the literature, but overall the three platforms are converging on [relatively similar error rates](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.466057v2.full]), undermining Illumina’s previous advantage. As a testament to this, short reads are no longer routinely used to supplement long reads in many published scientific studies. Interestingly, there is also a lot of interest from companies like Google to apply machine learning for improving sequencing accuracy. One study by Google and PacBio was able to [reduce errors by 42%](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.31.458403v1.full). These advances suggest to me that long reads can continue to make gains in accuracy and become the gold standard.\n\n# Beyond DNA sequence - detecting epigenetic modifiers\n\nTalking of machine learning, there is another neat feature of PacBio and ONT that I haven’t touched on: machine learning based epigenetic analysis. Bear with me. You may be aware that there is another layer on top of DNA sequence that can affect our genes, this is epigenetics. In practice it means there the DNA molecules get chemically modified, for example through the addition of a methyl group. When you slap a methyl group or some other modification on the DNA it can help turn genes on or off, making it important for some diseases and traits. Ok, biology lesson is over and I can get to the point. The data generated by PacBio and ONT actually allows [detection of DNA modifications like methylation](https://twitter.com/DRBFX/status/1517189018768883713). You get this information for free, together with the DNA sequence. All you need is the right machine learning algorithm and you can read off the epigenetics together with the genetics. Previously, the main way to study methylation was with a method called bisulfite sequencing that uses Illumina short reads and requires special sample preparation. It’s easier and just as, or more, accurate to do it with just PacBio or ONT.\n\nAs an investor, epigenetics is particularly exciting because unlike genetics it changes for each person over time. A person‘s DNA only needs to be sequenced once, but we may want to track changes in methylation in different parts of the body over time once we understand the implications for health and aging. I hope that ka-ching sound is ringing for you too. Epigentics, like liquid biopsy for cancer and pathogen surveillance, means repeated revenue over time. Right now, there isn’t a huge market for epigenetic analysis and compared to the DNA sequence this is mostly a ‘nice to have’ but not key feature. But as we understand epigenetics better and demand picks up, this feature could fuel further growth for PacBio and ONT.\n\n# How ONT stands out\n\nOne final advantage specific to ONT is its speed (measured as bases sequenced per hour) and the portability and flexibility of its instruments. ONT sequencing gives results in real-time and is generally faster than all the other technologies. A [recent study by Stanford scientists and Google](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2112090) showed that ONT can diagnose a patient by sequencing their genome in less than 8 hours. All other methods would take over a day to get the same results. Not all sequencing is time-critical, but in a clinical setting the speed of ONT gives it an edge. Incredibly, the ONT sequencing machines range in size from the dimension of a smartphone (MinIon) to a mini fridge (PromethION), while PacBio machines are fridge-sized and Illumina instrument sizes range from mini fridge to fridge. Finally, one recent ONT development that really blows my mind is their MinION Mk1D​, which combines [a MinION sequencer with an Apple iPad Pro](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion-mk1d) so you can sequence on the go! This isn’t out yet and may never be a big seller, but I think it underlines how portable and exciting the ONT technology is.\n\nAlthough this point is more subtle, I also want to mention the extraordinary Read Until capability of ONT. This allows sequencing to stop when a target sequence (e.g. a specific disease-related mutation) is found and to reject non-target sequences before they get fully sequenced. If we consider the problem of finding a needle in a haystack, with PacBio and Illumina, you sequence every straw of hay and then look for the needle, whereas ONT can immediately discard straws until it finds the needle in real time, saving time and money.\n\nThese unique advantages of ONT are the reason that I,  [together with other scientists in a twitter poll](https://twitter.com/TJesse62/status/1509927475077394438), think that ONT sequencing will ultimately prevail over PacBio thanks to its longer reads, greater portability and lower cost.\n\n# Financial fundamentals and valuation\n\nDespite impressive 2021 yearly revenue growth of [65% for PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/pacbio-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results-3/#:~:text=Fiscal%20year%202021%20results,with%20%2434.3%20million%20in%202020) and [94% for ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/preliminary-results-year-ended-31-december-2021-guidance-update-0), both companies still have negative earnings per share, losing $181M and $213M in 2021 respectively. Profitability may still be years away, as the leadership of both companies advises. Still, as shown below these are high margin businesses and can become profitable with scale.\n\n|*Sequencing provider*|*Gross profit margins (2021)*|\n|:-|:-|\n|Illumina|69%|\n|ONT|55%|\n|PacBio|45%|\n\nSome good news is that in 2021 both companies secured additional cash to fuel their growth. PacBio raised money (via convertible senior notes) from Softbank and reported cash and equivalents of $1B in the last quarter and ONT raised money through an IPO and reported $0.8B.\n\nNow a word on valuation. Valuing unprofitable biotech companies based on financials is tough. With a price-to-sales ratio (2021 revenues divided by today’s market cap) of 12 for PacBio and 20 for ONT, the long read companies are comparable to Illumina that comes in at 12 but more expensive than a mature biotech company like Thermofisher at 5. Importantly though, these multiples are nothing crazy like the &gt;50 price-to-sales ratios of biotech companies like Twist Biosciences ($TWST), BioNano ($BNGO) and even PacBio that we saw last year.  Today PacBio is worth less than the $8/share that Illumina offered in its foiled [acquisition attempt in 2018](https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/illumina-to-acquire-pacific-biosciences-for-approximately-1-2-billion-broadening-access-to-long-read-sequencing-and-accelerating-scientific-discovery/) and ONT is worth much less than the [$5.4/share IPO price](https://www.reuters.com/business/oxford-nanopore-eyes-47-billion-market-value-london-debut-2021-09-30/).\n\nThese are unprofitable biotech companies in the early stages of growth. It’s likely that this factor alone is the main reason these companies have been sold off (or sold short) as fears of inflation and recession swirl. For long-term investors, this presents a considerable opportunity.\n\n# Company leadership\n\nI don’t have many particular thoughts on the ONT and PacBio leadership, but my overall impression based on company performance, interviews and Glassdoor reports is relatively positive.\n\nONT has been led by its co-founder Gordon Sanghera, Ph.D. since 2005. The consistency and the scientific experience of the leadership here is a benefit for me. I think Dr Sanghera has substantial skin in the game and will execute on the long term vision for the company. He also holds anti-takeover shares to help ensure ONT can fulfill its potential rather than be gobbled up by a company like Illumina or Thermofisher.\n\nPacBio’s CEO Christian Henry has an MBA background and was a long-time Illumina executive before taking the job at PacBio in 2020. He brought along a number of other Illumina employees to pick up key roles at PacBio. I think Mr Henry has made some aggressive moves, like acquiring short read sequencing company Omniome and sample preparation firm Circulomics. I’m particularly hoping that the Illumina experience of the new PacBio leadership will help them to get their technology out there and drive sales, which is what Illumina excels at.\n\n# Risks\n\nAny savvy investor will realize that investing in unprofitable biotech companies is considerably more risky than a global market ETF. For PacBio and ONT specifically, there are several risks that could lead to a decline in the stock price.\n\nThe main long-term risk is competition. Illumina is aiming to provide their own [synthetic long read sequencing technology](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/long-read-sequencing.html). While this has been touted by some stock analysts, I share the [skepticism of other scientists about Illumina’s technology](http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/2022/01/illumina-teases-two-glittering-enigmas.html), which relies on stitching together short reads. A more realistic threat may be that Illumina drops their short read prices since they can no longer compete on sequence accuracy or length. This could take some sales from long read companies, but for many applications the benefits of true long reads are essential. PacBio and ONT are also direct competitors and it’s likely that one of them will emerge as a winner sooner or later. I’m hedging against this by holding both. My personal assessment is that currently PacBio has a more 'production-level' product and better customer service but ONT has the superior technology.\n\nA short-term risk is that macro headwinds further depress prices of growth stocks in 2022. A potential hedge against this is to spread out investments over this year. Although I may well be wrong, I personally think we are close to the bottom on biotech stocks based on reasonable valuation multiples and continued growth in the face of supply chain issues and other headwinds. \n\nFinally, both companies have high institutional ownership. ARK Genomics is the biggest PacBio shareholder with 10% ownership and the IP Group owns 14% of ONT. I don’t see a major long-term risk in this, but ARK and IP Group could eventually decide to dump their stock. Some might also see the high institutional ownership in both companies as a vote of confidence. For instance, Oracle bought a $190M stake in ONT last year and Tencent was also an early investor. All this is good to know, but overall the ownership of PacBio and ONT doesn’t impact my investment decisions in either direction.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nPacBio and ONT have unique industry-leading technology and are poised for rapid growth in the expanding market of DNA sequencing. With a total addressable market estimated at $40B and combined 2021 revenues of $300M, PacBio and ONT have lots of room to aggressively grow their market share against incumbent Illumina. Long reads are becoming longer, cheaper, and more accurate and provide fundamentally more useful information than Illumina’s  short reads that currently dominate the market. My long-term thesis is that long read sequencing technology won’t entirely displace short reads, but will increase its market share tenfold or more in the long term. The 2022 biotech sell-off has provided an attractive entry point to initiate a long position. And that’s why I’m going long on long reads.\n\n*Disclaimer: I’ve allocated 8% of my portfolio to ONT and 5% to PacBio. I aim to hold over 10 years, rebalancing if changes in technology or valuations justify it. Do your own DD and let me know your thoughts.*",

For example, the risk of cystic fibrosis and breast cancer is well understood to be passed down from parents to their children.

As we&amp;#39;ve probably all read in the last few years, DNA sequencing has also been crucial for tracking the evolution of SARS-CoV2 and its variants. The bottom line here is that DNA sequencing provides vital information for improving public health. Information that governments, insurance providers and hospitals are willing to pay good money for. For those outside of the world of biology, I cannot understate how fast biotechnology and precision medicine are developing and how fundamental DNA sequencing is for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What is the total addressable DNA sequencing market?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The DNA sequencing market had a size of &lt;a href=\"https://investor.pacificbiosciences.com/events-and-presentations\"&gt;$5.8B in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the development of precision healthcare and genetic surveillance of pathogens, this market is expected to grow at a fast clip. Though I don’t put much stock into exact predictions, some reports put the DNA sequencing market compound annual growth rate at &lt;a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/dna-sequencing-market#:%7E:text=The%20global%20DNA%20sequencing%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20grow%20at,USD%2011.21%20billion%20by%202027\"&gt;&amp;gt;10% from 2020 to 2027&lt;/a&gt;. The key thesis here is that not too far in the future, it will become routine healthcare policy to sequence and securely store the DNA of most individuals in developed countries. On top of that, I and others expect that sending tumor biopsy samples for sequencing and surveilling wastewater and other environments by sequencing will become routine, greatly expanding the sequencing market. Because DNA sequencing is a fundamental step in lots of modern biotech labs, one way to view DNA sequencing companies is as a pick-and-shovel play on the biotech sector. PacBio estimates a &lt;a href=\"https://investor.pacificbiosciences.com/static-files/9ee0d712-6974-4c44-83e9-5af75541add3\"&gt;$40B+ total addressable market for DNA sequencing&lt;/a&gt; and I think that’s realistic considering today’s trends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What’s the competitive landscape in DNA sequencing?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DNA sequencing is not a crowded field, with only a handful of companies playing a significant role. One reason for this is that, similarly to the semiconductor industry, the sequencing industry has a high barrier to entry due to technological complexity. Illumina ($ILMN) remains the 600 pound gorilla in the DNA sequencing space with a market cap of 50B and &lt;a href=\"https://investor.illumina.com/news/press-release-details/2022/Illumina-Reports-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2021/default.aspx#:%7E:text=Fiscal%20year%202021%20consolidated%20results,%243%2C239%20million%20in%20fiscal%202020\"&gt;2021 revenues of $4.5B&lt;/a&gt;. This translates roughly to a market share of 80% based on the estimated size of the 2021 market. With revenues of &lt;a href=\"https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/pacbio-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results-3/\"&gt;$130M for PacBio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/preliminary-results-year-ended-31-december-2021-guidance-update-0\"&gt;$177M for ONT&lt;/a&gt;, these companies are the Davids to Illumina’s Goliath. Today, PacBio commands a market cap of only $1.5B and ONT is in a similar but more highly valued ballpark of $3.5B. Despite the fact that PacBio has been around since 2004 and ONT since 2005, they have not yet had a significant impact on Illumina’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few other companies worth mentioning to get the full picture, though I consider them less important for this thesis. In China, MGI is a large sequencing provider that reverse engineered Illumina’s technology and remains banned from the US market and has not penetrated the European market. One of the biggest biotech instrument producers Thermofisher ($TMO) makes the IonTorrent DNA sequencer, but it’s not competitive on price or data quality so is rarely used. There are also two new US companies (Singular Genomics $OMIC and the private Elements Biosciences) that will be launching sequencing instruments similar to Illumina’s in the next year or so. For those interested in more details, Keith Robinson is a scientist with a &lt;a href=\"http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/\"&gt;great blog&lt;/a&gt; on these and other sequencing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why do we need long reads from PACB and ONT?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When comparing sequencing technologies, the three main quality metrics we care about are sequence length (measured in bases), sequence accuracy and the cost per sequenced base. The longer, the more accurate, and the cheaper a sequence is, the better. I should state here that fundamentally, Illumina, PacBio and ONT use completely distinct sequencing technologies, each with some individual advantages. What makes PacBio and ONT unique compared to all the other sequencing companies is their &lt;em&gt;long reads&lt;/em&gt;. All other technologies are based on &lt;em&gt;short reads&lt;/em&gt;. As someone who has worked a lot with sequencing data, I can tell you that here size matters. Without getting too technical, DNA sequences from Illumina and the other sequencing companies are usually 50-500 bases in length while PacBio gives lengths around 10,000 bases and ONT comes packing 10,000-30,000 bases (sometimes up to several million bases).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why do we care about the sequence length, you ask? Well imagine the DNA sequences are pieces of a puzzle. The difference in getting answers from long read sequencing data and short read sequencing data is like the difference between putting together a 10 piece puzzle and a 100 piece puzzle. Not only that, the short read puzzle is usually missing 10% of its pieces. The reasons for this are technical and related to long stretches of repetitive sequence that make it hard to get the whole picture with short reads. There are notable exceptions where long reads are not needed, including liquid biopsy where we are sequencing short fragments of cancer DNA often less than 200 bases in length. But what matters is that for most applications, when using Illumina data, there’s a moderate amount (perhaps &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929722000659\"&gt;roughly 25%&lt;/a&gt;) of genetic variation that remains hidden. Some of this hidden variation can cause disease. For example, Evan Eichler, a well-known scientist at the University of Washington, emphasized in a recent article that 34% of all disease-causing variation is made up of variants that are &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6681822/\"&gt;larger than a single base change&lt;/a&gt;, which are more difficult to detect with short reads. We can conclude that long reads offer critical advantages over short reads in clinical and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How cost-competitive are long reads?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The extra length of ONT and PacBio does come at a cost. The key cost metric is the price of a human genome (typically at 30x coverage, which means you sequence each base 30 times on average to make sure you don’t miss anything). Cost estimates can vary widely but sequencing expert &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertVilella\"&gt;Albert Villela&lt;/a&gt; has put together &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMMfhyLK0-q8XkIo3YxlWaZA5vVMuhU1kg41g4xLkXc/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;amp;hl=en_GB#gid=1569422585\"&gt;a public tabular comparison of different providers&lt;/a&gt;, from which I extracted some ballpark ranges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sequencing provider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost per human genome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Illumina/MGI&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$1,000-$6,000&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;ONT&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$2,000-$6,000&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;PacBio&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$5,000-$40,000&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I have to stress that cost estimates vary a lot, clearly Illumina has a lead on cost. However, if we are making clinical decisions affecting people’s health, arguably we healthcare providers may pay a premium to make sure they get the most complete possible information. On top of this, the cost of ONT and PacBio have come down considerably in the last few years and their pace of innovation here has outstripped Illumina. ONT actually reported in their 2021 annual results that they can already generate &lt;a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/sites/default/files/s3/investors/reports/ONT%20FY21%20Results%20Presentation%20FINAL%2022.3.22.pdf\"&gt;a $345 human genome&lt;/a&gt; and are developing a system to go as low as $235, which would be groundbreaking if this translates to prices for users on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to think of Illumina as similar to Intel: a long time market monopolist with juicy margins (&lt;a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/ILMN/gross_profit_margin\"&gt;Illumina gross margin 69% for the last four years&lt;/a&gt;, nice) that has lost its innovative edge and kept iterating on the same short read sequencing technology. ONT has already come dangerously close in cost to Illumina, and has a real chance of becoming cheaper than Illumina in future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Long read accuracy - still the Achilles heel?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to now talk about sequence accuracy. What is this? Just like us humans, all sequencing methods make mistakes. These take the form of incorrect bases in the DNA sequence, like typos in a text. For many applications a few errors don’t matter, but when we care about detecting very specific genetic mutations related to disease, we want to avoid even a small number of errors. In the past, Illumina and others have downplayed the threat from long read sequencing by citing its lower sequence accuracy. And until recently it was uncommon to use PacBio or ONT data alone because you needed additional Illumina data to correct the mistakes in the long reads. In the last few years, this has changed as PacBio introduced high-fidelity HiFi reads and &lt;a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/sites/default/files/s3/investors/reports/ONT%20FY21%20Results%20Presentation%20FINAL%2022.3.22.pdf\"&gt;ONT introduced its latest Kit 14 chemistry and duplex sequencing&lt;/a&gt;. Illumina no longer has a monopoly on accurate high-throughput reads as the table below shows and &lt;a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.466057v2.full\"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; nicely lays out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sequencing provider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sequencing accuracy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Illumina/MGI&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;99.9%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;ONT&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;95%-99.9%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;PacBio&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;98%-99.9%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All these error rates seem low, but remember when you sequence a human genome with 6.4 billion bases, a 99.9% error rate means 6.4 million errors. Even a 0.01% improvement is therefore a big deal. There is some fineprint to the table above and its based on manufacturer numbers and my own experience with the data and reading of the literature, but overall the three platforms are converging on &lt;a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.466057v2.full%5D\"&gt;relatively similar error rates&lt;/a&gt;, undermining Illumina’s previous advantage. As a testament to this, short reads are no longer routinely used to supplement long reads in many published scientific studies. Interestingly, there is also a lot of interest from companies like Google to apply machine learning for improving sequencing accuracy. One study by Google and PacBio was able to &lt;a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.31.458403v1.full\"&gt;reduce errors by 42%&lt;/a&gt;. These advances suggest to me that long reads can continue to make gains in accuracy and become the gold standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Beyond DNA sequence - detecting epigenetic modifiers&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talking of machine learning, there is another neat feature of PacBio and ONT that I haven’t touched on: machine learning based epigenetic analysis. Bear with me. You may be aware that there is another layer on top of DNA sequence that can affect our genes, this is epigenetics. In practice it means there the DNA molecules get chemically modified, for example through the addition of a methyl group. When you slap a methyl group or some other modification on the DNA it can help turn genes on or off, making it important for some diseases and traits. Ok, biology lesson is over and I can get to the point. The data generated by PacBio and ONT actually allows &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/DRBFX/status/1517189018768883713\"&gt;detection of DNA modifications like methylation&lt;/a&gt;. You get this information for free, together with the DNA sequence. All you need is the right machine learning algorithm and you can read off the epigenetics together with the genetics. Previously, the main way to study methylation was with a method called bisulfite sequencing that uses Illumina short reads and requires special sample preparation. It’s easier and just as, or more, accurate to do it with just PacBio or ONT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an investor, epigenetics is particularly exciting because unlike genetics it changes for each person over time. A person‘s DNA only needs to be sequenced once, but we may want to track changes in methylation in different parts of the body over time once we understand the implications for health and aging. I hope that ka-ching sound is ringing for you too. Epigentics, like liquid biopsy for cancer and pathogen surveillance, means repeated revenue over time. Right now, there isn’t a huge market for epigenetic analysis and compared to the DNA sequence this is mostly a ‘nice to have’ but not key feature. But as we understand epigenetics better and demand picks up, this feature could fuel further growth for PacBio and ONT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How ONT stands out&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One final advantage specific to ONT is its speed (measured as bases sequenced per hour) and the portability and flexibility of its instruments. ONT sequencing gives results in real-time and is generally faster than all the other technologies. A &lt;a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2112090\"&gt;recent study by Stanford scientists and Google&lt;/a&gt; showed that ONT can diagnose a patient by sequencing their genome in less than 8 hours. All other methods would take over a day to get the same results. Not all sequencing is time-critical, but in a clinical setting the speed of ONT gives it an edge. Incredibly, the ONT sequencing machines range in size from the dimension of a smartphone (MinIon) to a mini fridge (PromethION), while PacBio machines are fridge-sized and Illumina instrument sizes range from mini fridge to fridge. Finally, one recent ONT development that really blows my mind is their MinION Mk1D​, which combines &lt;a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion-mk1d\"&gt;a MinION sequencer with an Apple iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; so you can sequence on the go! This isn’t out yet and may never be a big seller, but I think it underlines how portable and exciting the ONT technology is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although this point is more subtle, I also want to mention the extraordinary Read Until capability of ONT. This allows sequencing to stop when a target sequence (e.g. a specific disease-related mutation) is found and to reject non-target sequences before they get fully sequenced. If we consider the problem of finding a needle in a haystack, with PacBio and Illumina, you sequence every straw of hay and then look for the needle, whereas ONT can immediately discard straws until it finds the needle in real time, saving time and money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These unique advantages of ONT are the reason that I,  &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TJesse62/status/1509927475077394438\"&gt;together with other scientists in a twitter poll&lt;/a&gt;, think that ONT sequencing will ultimately prevail over PacBio thanks to its longer reads, greater portability and lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Financial fundamentals and valuation&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite impressive 2021 yearly revenue growth of &lt;a href=\"https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/pacbio-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results-3/#:%7E:text=Fiscal%20year%202021%20results,with%20%2434.3%20million%20in%202020\"&gt;65% for PacBio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/preliminary-results-year-ended-31-december-2021-guidance-update-0\"&gt;94% for ONT&lt;/a&gt;, both companies still have negative earnings per share, losing $181M and $213M in 2021 respectively. Profitability may still be years away, as the leadership of both companies advises. Still, as shown below these are high margin businesses and can become profitable with scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sequencing provider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gross profit margins (2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Illumina&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;69%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;ONT&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;55%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;PacBio&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;45%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some good news is that in 2021 both companies secured additional cash to fuel their growth. PacBio raised money (via convertible senior notes) from Softbank and reported cash and equivalents of $1B in the last quarter and ONT raised money through an IPO and reported $0.8B.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now a word on valuation. Valuing unprofitable biotech companies based on financials is tough. With a price-to-sales ratio (2021 revenues divided by today’s market cap) of 12 for PacBio and 20 for ONT, the long read companies are comparable to Illumina that comes in at 12 but more expensive than a mature biotech company like Thermofisher at 5. Importantly though, these multiples are nothing crazy like the &amp;gt;50 price-to-sales ratios of biotech companies like Twist Biosciences ($TWST), BioNano ($BNGO) and even PacBio that we saw last year.  Today PacBio is worth less than the $8/share that Illumina offered in its foiled &lt;a href=\"https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/illumina-to-acquire-pacific-biosciences-for-approximately-1-2-billion-broadening-access-to-long-read-sequencing-and-accelerating-scientific-discovery/\"&gt;acquisition attempt in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and ONT is worth much less than the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/oxford-nanopore-eyes-47-billion-market-value-london-debut-2021-09-30/\"&gt;$5.4/share IPO price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are unprofitable biotech companies in the early stages of growth. It’s likely that this factor alone is the main reason these companies have been sold off (or sold short) as fears of inflation and recession swirl. For long-term investors, this presents a considerable opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Company leadership&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t have many particular thoughts on the ONT and PacBio leadership, but my overall impression based on company performance, interviews and Glassdoor reports is relatively positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ONT has been led by its co-founder Gordon Sanghera, Ph.D. since 2005. The consistency and the scientific experience of the leadership here is a benefit for me. I think Dr Sanghera has substantial skin in the game and will execute on the long term vision for the company. He also holds anti-takeover shares to help ensure ONT can fulfill its potential rather than be gobbled up by a company like Illumina or Thermofisher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PacBio’s CEO Christian Henry has an MBA background and was a long-time Illumina executive before taking the job at PacBio in 2020. He brought along a number of other Illumina employees to pick up key roles at PacBio. I think Mr Henry has made some aggressive moves, like acquiring short read sequencing company Omniome and sample preparation firm Circulomics. I’m particularly hoping that the Illumina experience of the new PacBio leadership will help them to get their technology out there and drive sales, which is what Illumina excels at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Risks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any savvy investor will realize that investing in unprofitable biotech companies is considerably more risky than a global market ETF. For PacBio and ONT specifically, there are several risks that could lead to a decline in the stock price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main long-term risk is competition. Illumina is aiming to provide their own &lt;a href=\"https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/long-read-sequencing.html\"&gt;synthetic long read sequencing technology&lt;/a&gt;. While this has been touted by some stock analysts, I share the &lt;a href=\"http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/2022/01/illumina-teases-two-glittering-enigmas.html\"&gt;skepticism of other scientists about Illumina’s technology&lt;/a&gt;, which relies on stitching together short reads. A more realistic threat may be that Illumina drops their short read prices since they can no longer compete on sequence accuracy or length. This could take some sales from long read companies, but for many applications the benefits of true long reads are essential. PacBio and ONT are also direct competitors and it’s likely that one of them will emerge as a winner sooner or later. I’m hedging against this by holding both. My personal assessment is that currently PacBio has a more &amp;#39;production-level&amp;#39; product and better customer service but ONT has the superior technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A short-term risk is that macro headwinds further depress prices of growth stocks in 2022. A potential hedge against this is to spread out investments over this year. Although I may well be wrong, I personally think we are close to the bottom on biotech stocks based on reasonable valuation multiples and continued growth in the face of supply chain issues and other headwinds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, both companies have high institutional ownership. ARK Genomics is the biggest PacBio shareholder with 10% ownership and the IP Group owns 14% of ONT. I don’t see a major long-term risk in this, but ARK and IP Group could eventually decide to dump their stock. Some might also see the high institutional ownership in both companies as a vote of confidence. For instance, Oracle bought a $190M stake in ONT last year and Tencent was also an early investor. All this is good to know, but overall the ownership of PacBio and ONT doesn’t impact my investment decisions in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PacBio and ONT have unique industry-leading technology and are poised for rapid growth in the expanding market of DNA sequencing. With a total addressable market estimated at $40B and combined 2021 revenues of $300M, PacBio and ONT have lots of room to aggressively grow their market share against incumbent Illumina. Long reads are becoming longer, cheaper, and more accurate and provide fundamentally more useful information than Illumina’s  short reads that currently dominate the market. My long-term thesis is that long read sequencing technology won’t entirely displace short reads, but will increase its market share tenfold or more in the long term. The 2022 biotech sell-off has provided an attractive entry point to initiate a long position. And that’s why I’m going long on long reads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I’ve allocated 8% of my portfolio to ONT and 5% to PacBio. I aim to hold over 10 years, rebalancing if changes in technology or valuations justify it. Do your own DD and let me know your thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
