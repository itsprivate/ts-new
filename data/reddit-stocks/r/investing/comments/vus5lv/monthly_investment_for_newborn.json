I’m 100% on board with beginning to invest for him but the savings account doesn’t seem to be the best option. I’d think investing in ETFs for 18 years would offer a better return. Is anyone out there willing to offer any advice? Thanks in advance!!\n\nEdit: I genuinely want to thank everyone for sharing their advice and experiences. I come from a poor family with essentially no financial knowledge, just living week to week. I’m the first to be *somewhat* successful and want to be able to provide more for my children while also teaching them financial literacy. I’m still learning myself so that I can teach them. So again, I truly appreciate everyone’s advice.",
