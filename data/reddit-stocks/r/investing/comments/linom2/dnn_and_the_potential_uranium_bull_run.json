It is definitely undervalued. With the current technologies and security improves, the risk of that kind of events is minimal.</p>\n\n<p>As for DNN:</p>\n\n<p>- Denison mines has found perhaps the best single uranium deposit in the world, the Canadian Saskatchewan. Their Phoenix project at Wheeler River has showed a 19.1% grade uranium sample. For context, between 0.5 and 1 is decent, while anything above 4 is considered great.</p>\n\n<p>- The discovered Uranium is close to the ground: their operating cost is an insanely cheap 9 dollars per pound.</p>\n\n<p>- An absolutely insane options increase. 150k Mar. 19 $2.50 call options added this week. The 99.9% call to put ratio, indicates to me someone knows something.</p>\n\n<p>Uranium mining may not be sexy, but if Uranium prices go from $30/lb back toward their all-time highs of $140/lb, I see DNN as being poised to capitalize massively.</p>\n\n<p>My perspective is long term bullish, but the options activity has me being very near-term bullish.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Uranium ores typically have very low yields of the element of between 0.1 to 0.2%, and some have concentrations lower than 0.05%. The Canadian Saskatchewan mines are the exception and have yields of more than 20% uranium.&quot; <a href=\"https://commodity.com/energy/uranium/\">https://commodity.com/energy/uranium/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denison-announces-discovery-of-high-grade-uranium-mineralization-four-kilometres-northwest-of-phoenix-301216940.html\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denison-announces-discovery-of-high-grade-uranium-mineralization-four-kilometres-northwest-of-phoenix-301216940.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.denisonmines.com/news/denison-announces-discovery-of-high-grade-uranium-122721/\">https://www.denisonmines.com/news/denison-announces-discovery-of-high-grade-uranium-122721/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DNN/options?date=1616112000\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DNN/options?date=1616112000</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.valuethemarkets.com/2021/01/25/perfect-conditions-for-uranium-to-shine/\">https://www.valuethemarkets.com/2021/01/25/perfect-conditions-for-uranium-to-shine/</a></p>\n\n<p>I´ve been long on DNN for a long time and I think the time of the Uranium bull run (especially DNN) is just starting.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a financial advice. 12000 @ 0.55</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
