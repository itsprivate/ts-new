As many of you probably know, Cathy&#39;s investment strategy is based on Wright&#39;s law, which states that for every cumulative doubling of units produced, costs decline at a consistent rate. According to Cathy, ARK&#39;s research strategy starts by discovering when the costs in various innovative industries have declined to a low enough point to indicate exponential growth in that industry, and therefore the leading companies in that industry. </p>\n\n<p>Seems simple enough, but I&#39;m curious as to how a retail investor would ever be able to find the relevant information to use a similar strategy. I can only assume that ARK has tons of research vehicles in play to analyze how quickly costs change and at what price level customers will start entering into the market. I&#39;ve been trying to think if there is a way to find this information in a companies financials, maybe hidden within some relationship of numbers but I just don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have anything to contribute? I&#39;m really just curious if other people have gone down this path and whether they have gotten anywhere with it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
