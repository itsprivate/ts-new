Home sales are down 4 months in a row, and commercial real estate sales are also down\n3. The 30 year skyrocketed to over 6% on Friday, in what Mortgage News Daily called \"the worst day in decades\"\n4. MBS auction went \"no bid\" last week\n5. Property affordability is at an all-time low, and we are headed into a potentially severe recession\n\nMy inclination was to hold my REITs long-term and simply collect dividends, but now I am worried these things are going to lost 90% of their value in the next 1-2 years.\n\nWhat are the rest of you doing?",
