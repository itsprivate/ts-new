I'm hoping someone here can either point out the risk or I just helped the readers of this post earn an extra 2.5% in their portfolio as well.\n\nSo I obviously have a portfolio.  The holdings of portfolio can be used as collateral to take out loans.  In my case, I can use the portfolio to take out a loan at 4% APY.  The loan amount is 50% of the portfolio with a 42% liquidation margin.  \n\nNow, I have discovered a platform that offers fractional real-estate investing of rental properties.  Shares of properties are sold and rent dividends are paid out daily.  The CoC return of occupied rental properties range anywhere from 5% to 12%, with most falling in the 8-9% CoC range and an IRR of 13-14% over the next 3 years, calculated by HouseCanary. \n\nThe platform will also buy-back shares of the property at 95% it's value if you want to sell your share back.  The platform has a 5% listing fee, so this is why it isn't 100%.\n\nMy thought is to use my portfolio as collateral to take out a loan at 4% APY and purchase shares of multiple (reduce risk) rental properties on a 1+ year lease with a 9% CoC return paid daily.  4% will go directly to interest payments and 5% will be used as I see fit.  \n\nMy portfolio will grow at the current rate it is growing, with 50% (loan amount) earning an extra 5% (so 2.5% as a whole).  If the liquidation margin gets close, I can simply sell the shares of the property back to the platform and use the proceeds to pay down the loan more quickly. I know I could use the proceeds to add more collateral, but personally I don't want to risk runaway leverage.  If this happens, I would lose the 5% listing fee.  However, if the property value increase by 5%, I hold for &gt;1 year (so pocket 5% in dividends), or a mixture of the two, I will break even.\n\nIs there any other risk I am missing? I understand it's theoretically possible for my portfolio to drop 40% in a day and I get liquidated, but I don't see this happening in reality.",
