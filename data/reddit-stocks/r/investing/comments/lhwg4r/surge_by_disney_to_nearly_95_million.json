He also noted spikes in usage for ESPN+ (up 83% to 12.1 million) and Hulu (up 30% to 35.4 million).</p>\n\n<p>Disney’s Media and Entertainment Distribution, which includes Disney+, brought in $12.66 billion for the quarter, a decline of 5% from the same quarter a year ago before the pandemic swept across the country. The Disney Parks, Experiences and Products unit took in $3.6 billion, down 53% year-over-year as many Disney parks and its cruise line remain closed. The flagship Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Calif., and Disneyland Paris will stay closed in the current quarter, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said during the analyst call.</p>\n\n<p>The sustained strength of Disney+ has impressed Wall Street analysts despite stiffening competition from Apple Inc.’s <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote\">AAPL</a> Apple TV+, Netflix Inc. <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/NFLX?mod=MW_story_quote\">NFLX,</a> AT&amp;T Inc.’s <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/T?mod=MW_story_quote\">T</a> HBO Max, Comcast Corp.’s <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/CMCSA?mod=MW_story_quote\">CMCSA</a> Peacock, Amazon.com Inc.’s <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMZN?mod=MW_story_quote\">AMZN</a> Prime Video, and others.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
