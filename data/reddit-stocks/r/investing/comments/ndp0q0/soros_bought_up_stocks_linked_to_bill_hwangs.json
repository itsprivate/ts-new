A person familiar with the fund’s trading said the company didn’t hold the shares prior to Archegos’s implosion.  </p>\n\n<p>Soros also increased its bet on <strong>Amazon.com Inc.</strong> and homebuilder <strong>DR Horton Inc.</strong>, which is now its second-largest public equity position.  </p>\n\n<p>The 13F, which money managers overseeing more than $100 million in U.S. equities must file quarterly, revealed that Soros held $4.5 billion of U.S. equities, down $77 million from the prior quarter.  </p>\n\n<p>The biggest exit in the quarter was <strong>Palantir Technologies Inc.</strong> Soros sold 18.5 million shares valued at about $435 million. The firm originally revealed it owned a stake in the controversial data-mining company controlled by Peter Thiel in November, but rapidly issued a statement saying the original investment was made in 2012 and it regretted the decision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
