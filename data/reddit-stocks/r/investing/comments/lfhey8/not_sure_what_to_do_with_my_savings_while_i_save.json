I currently have about 30k (16k in an RH account and 14k in savings) and am saving around ~1800 a month. This does not include my 6 month emergency savings.</p>\n\n<p>In November I took $4500 and opened an <del>IRA</del> broker account with RH as my &quot;gambling&quot; account. It was money that I wanted to learn with and could afford to lose. I figured any extra earnings would go towards my house fund. That $4500 is now $16000 (everyones a genius in a bull market). So $4500 was money I could afford to lose but $16000 isn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what to do from here. The options I&#39;m considering:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Pull out the 10k and put it in a savings account with my other 14k. I heard that you shouldn&#39;t invest money you plan on using within a year. It might take a little longer than a year for me to buy a house though.</li>\n<li>Invest the 10k into an index fund and keep the other 4.5k in high risk stocks like my original setup.</li>\n<li>Take 5k into savings and keep the other 5k in the account to invest in stocks/index funds</li>\n<li>Let it ride (JK, not doing this)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;m currently 30 years old if that makes a difference. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just realized IRA was not the term I should&#39;ve been using. It&#39;s a regular, not tax advantaged broker account with robinhood.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
