Thanks to** u/J0eBidensSunglasses **for pointing me to this article.**\n\nFrom [Morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1083334/autocracy-is-a-bad-investment):\n\n&gt;Sure, investors might make money for a while, but in the end, all that matters are the rules set by the person running the country.

It's a country where most diversified investors have only a [small percentage](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1082249) of their portfolio. It's a different story for a country like China. Many mutual funds and stocks have hefty direct or indirect exposure to the country, and observers who had warned about Russia are encouraging investors to ask similar questions about China.\n\nFurther, famed fund manager Bill Browder opines:\n\n&gt;Rule of law should be a primary consideration for investors, says Bill Browder, the famed hedge fund manager who made his fortune in Russia, only to be deported after run-ins with oligarchs and whose Russian lawyer was arrested in Moscow, mistreated by authorities, and died in a prison.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"You can do all the analysis you want on an industry, on the economics, on the management team, and then all of a sudden somebody comes along and rips you off, and you don't have any recourse in the courts, you don't have recourse in the media … and generally if they're not rule-of-law countries, you have no recourse with the regulators,\" he says. \"It's flying by the seat of your pants, hoping you're in the good graces of whoever is in charge.\"\n\nHaving come from that side of the world, I've always been wary of markets like China and Russia for exactly the reasons that Morningstar lays out.  When asked, my answer is always the same:  Do you understand the accounting rules of that country?  Do you understand the business dynamics and customs of that country—i.e. if lying and bribery are commonplace, what does that mean for your fundamental analysis?  Still, as Browder points out, you can be an expert on these things and still get whacked by one man who makes decisions not on the basis of what is economically sound, but whatever strokes his own ego.",
