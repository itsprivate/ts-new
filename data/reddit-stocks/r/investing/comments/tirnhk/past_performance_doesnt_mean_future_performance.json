If you say, \"Hey, apple and Microsoft are great! they've been great companies, have tons of money flowing to them, and are one of the biggest things ever!\" people will yell at you and go \"NOOOO PAST PERFORMANCE DOESNT EQUAL FUTURE PERFORMANCE, NOOO\" \n\nbut then when you ask those same people what they invest in, they'll say \"I invest in VTI, since they've gone up consistently year over year over year, have tons of money flowing to it, and is one of the biggest things ever! It even goes up on average 7-10% every year!!\"\n\nLike. sure, I get the whole theory behind it but I'm pretty sure people wouldn't be so keen to invest in VTI if it wasn't going up an average of 7-10% every year. \n\nit seems like in order to really get a good investment on anything, you need to factor in past performance. You could have a billion dollar idea but if you haven't generated the cash flows and performance, what you have is just that, an idea that doesn't exist. It just seems odd that people dismiss investing in good solid companies as \"recency bias\" or \"past performance chasing\" even though they're doing that exact thing with VTI. Again, even if the theory was the exact same but VTI lost money year over year, I genuinely don't think people would be investing in it. *everybody Invests in broad market funds because past performance shows they do go up over time*",
