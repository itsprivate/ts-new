Buy a few good index funds and ETFs to begin with. Slowly you can focus on individual stocks once you are comfortable.\n4. Buy these in installments. Set a cap for the max amount you can invest for a given stock and DO NOT cross that on a single day. For e.g. $300, $500, $1K etc. Now that there is NO charge for buying and selling stocks/ETFs in most places, you can buy these in any quantity any number of times. Even some brokers allow fractional stock tradings.\n5. Go for stable and big companies. Check P/E, EPS, Dividend income etc. Set a market cap limit for a company. For e.g. $1B. Don’t invest in small companies as they might be too risky. Also don’t go for penny stocks. Better to buy stocks that are traded above $10.\n6. If you are using a tax paying account, try to do tax harvesting by doing bottom fishing when good opportunities come.

Most of the times, after announcing quarterly results, stock crashes even though they announce good results but due to bad forecasting of future results.
