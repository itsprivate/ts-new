The momentum seems to continue across the market, stocks getting super pumped. There are even travel stocks that are HIGHER than their highest of highs before the pandemic. It&#39;s truly a confounding market that I cannot explain or begin to understand, So I&#39;m looking for some fundamental guidance</p>\n\n<p>The portfolio is 80% long term with safer more long term markets, and 20% short term more risky picks. Part of the 80% are recovery stocks that are most likely to bounce back after a correction.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
