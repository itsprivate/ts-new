It is the worst kind of party-pooping. For bubbles, **especially superbubbles where we are now**, are often the most exhilarating financial experiences of a lifetime.\" \n\n\"The final feature of the great superbubbles has been **a sustained narrowing of the market and unique underperformance of speculative stocks**, many of which fall as the blue chip market rises. **This occurred in 1929, in 2000, and it is occurring now**. A plausible reason for this effect would be that experienced professionals who know that the market is dangerously overpriced yet feel for commercial reasons they must keep dancing prefer at least to dance off the cliff with safer stocks. This is why **at the end of the great bubbles it seems as if the confidence termites attack the most speculative and vulnerable first and work their way up, sometimes quite slowly, to the blue chips**.\"\n\nBut now, for the first time in the U.S. **we have simultaneous bubbles across all major asset classes**. To detail:\n\nFirst, we are indeed participating in the broadest and most extreme global real estate bubble in history. Today **houses in the U.S. are at the highest multiple of family income ever, after a record 20% gain last year, ahead even of the disastrous housing bubble of 2006**. But although the U.S. housing market is selling at a high multiple of family income, it is less, sometimes far less, than many other countries, e.g., Canada, Australia, the U.K., and especially China. (In China, real estate has played an unusually important and unique role in the extended boom and thereby poses an equally unique risk to the economy and hence the rest of the world if its real estate market loses air exactly as it appears to be doing as we sit.)\n\nSecond, we have the most exuberant, ecstatic, even crazy investor behavior in the history of the U.S. stock market. **The U.S. market today has, in my opinion, the greatest buy-in ever to the idea that stocks only go up, which is surely the real essence of a bubble**. (Interestingly, where other developed countries lead in housing prices, they lag the U.S. in equity prices. Some, such as Japan, by so much that they are merely slightly overpriced today.)\n\nThird, as if this were not enough, **we also have the highest-priced bond markets in the U.S. and most other countries around the world, and the lowest rates, of course, that go with them, that human history has ever seen.**\n\nWhat our financial leadership should know is that multiplying these risks – these three and a half bubbles – will multiply the total shock if the damage occurs simultaneously. And this package presents **more potential for writing down perceived wealth than at any previous time in history**.",
