I'm also estimating Healthcare costs and insurance as well as travel/vacation.\n\n\nBut do I need to be inflation adjusting these expenses in order to match up with where I'm projecting my portfolio growth to be in 10 to 15 years from now?\n\n\n\nIf I use today's estimated costs for things I'll need in 15 years from now when I may reach FI and potentially RE will my numbers be somewhat accurate? Or will they be way off?\n\n\nI'm also guessing that $1200 per month can get my wife and I health insurance with maybe a 6k deductible. \n\nAnd I'm estimating that after 10 to 15 years we'll refinance the house and will owe less per month than current. 155k owed currently. Probably 100k owed in 10 years if we make a few extra payments here and there. \n\nI see s&amp;p500 is 10.5 percent annual returns before inflation adjustment and 7 percent adjusted. I assume 7 percent is the number I would use. \n\n\nDo I use a compound interest calculator for these growth projections? I know it's not a CD or a bond so I didn't know if compound calculator was the choice for this sort of investment. \n\n\n\nWhat savings goal should I realistically set? I'm not looking to nail it down to an exact number but I'd like to know if I'm in the right ballpark with my estimates. I keep coming up with between 1.8M and 2.5M depending on how I project my expenses. But if I need to be projecting my future inflation adjusted expenses then my numbers are too low... \n\n\n\n I'm aiming for 28X my annual spending because I'll be a bit less than 50 years old when I may start reaching these portfolio values needed. So need to get 50 years out of the portfolio.\n\n\n\nAnd my portfolio allocation is going to be 50 percent VTI and 50 percent VOO. I know it's a redundant mix. I currently have a lump sum of cash that I can DCA into the market over the next 18 months so I can change this allocation if needed.",
