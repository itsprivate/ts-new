The fitness offering, I think, pairs really well with their roster on the team which (as covered above) is highly experienced in sports and media.</p>\n\n<p>Peloton is due for a competitor. It&#39;s a great platform but its not the solution EVERYONE needs. MYX Fitness&#39; products offer added choice to a marketplace that is foaming at the mouth for more options.</p>\n\n<p>The company has been around for over 20 years which is just a nice reassurance</p>\n\n<p>Because of how the deal is structured, it appears the company will now be, more than ever, able to expand via acquisitions (they actually mention this in the article) and a HEAVY digital marketing spend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ticker:</strong> FRX (for now)</p>\n\n<p><strong>More info:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/beachbody-to-go-public-via-3-way-merger-with-forest-road-spac-and-myx-fitness-2021-02-10\">MarketWatch Coverage</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
