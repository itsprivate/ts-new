An example being Tesla. Ali claims that you could potentially see a greater return by investing in the companies that make up the different ARK ETF’s in your own portfolio and you wouldn’t have to pay the % fees that the ETF charges.</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if you all could discuss and provide feedback about the advantages and disadvantages of both perspectives? I am currently invested in ARK ETF’s and hold positions in individual companies but this video has made me reconsider how I feel about investing in ETF’s. </p>\n\n<p>I am beginning to wonder if I would see greater returns in liquidating my ETF positions and investing in individual companies stocks?</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the ARK ETF’s over just holding positions in individual companies you believe in?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
