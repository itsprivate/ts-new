As of the end of the latest quarter, the Vision Fund had lost $9.7 billion of the $12.1 billion it invested in Didi, the company said.\n\nThere is more pain to come: SoftBank said its holdings in publicly listed Vision Fund companies fell by more than $13 billion since its fiscal year ended March 31.\n\n...\n\nIn all, SoftBank said the Vision Fund has made just $3.1 billion on the $45.6 billion it invested in its publicly listed companies as of Wednesday’s stock market close, a slim return after five years in which the Nasdaq has nearly doubled.\n\nHe devoted much of the presentation to trying to reassure shareholders concerned about SoftBank’s debt levels, telling them that he is closely managing its debt and cash.\n\nIn recent months, the company borrowed nearly $6 billion tied to startup investments in its Vision Fund 2 division—an unusual move for a venture capital fund given the high risks involved—and raised additional money through financial instruments tied to its nearly 25% stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding.\n\n...\n\nThis earnings report covers up to March 31, 2022.  Think about how much more SFTBY must have lost since then...",
