However, I bought back a lot of GME yesterday after a dip and finally gave up today seeing that the bubble had already burst and it wasn&#39;t a dip.</p>\n\n<p>Can I live without $1500. Yes (In fact I even forgot to cash in a $1500 check for over a year). I&#39;m only 23 and in grad school, so I like to look at each dollar very carefully. I&#39;m also anguished at all the things $1500 could&#39;ve bought me (a 75&#39;&#39; flat screen TV, a plane ticket to anywhere in the world, etc. But 1500 is only about 3% of my assets so I&#39;m trying to sweat this off and move on as quick as possible. But I learned not to jump on stocks based on emotion. At one point, I was even up $1000 but I got too greedy and look where I&#39;m now.</p>\n\n<p>On the bright side, my overall portfolio is only down $600 since New Years Day and I&#39;m still up 20% since last february (compared to the S&amp;P gain on 18%)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
