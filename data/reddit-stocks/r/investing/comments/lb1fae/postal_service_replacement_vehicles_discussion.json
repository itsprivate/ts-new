They then went into how they’ll be replaced and the ~6 billion dollar contract that comes with them. Currently it’s narrowed down to 3 finalists but has been postponed due to COVID-19. The final 3 companies/ partnerships are Workhorse Group ($WKHS), Karsan and Morgan Olson ($KRSOF &amp; no ticker found for Morgan Olson), and Oshkosh and Ford ($OSK &amp; $F respectively.) I wanted to start a discussion on this and get some other peoples views on investment opportunities. Supposedly, a decision is expected to come out soon. </p>\n\n<p>With the big push towards EV vehicles I feel like workhorse has the best shot. Ford and Oshkosh are going with a regular gas engine while the other 2 manufacturers are going EV/ Hybrid. </p>\n\n<p>Not sure if someone has brought this up already if not and I’m sorry if I missed it. </p>\n\n<p>Info:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2020/12/01/postal-service-delays-mail-truck-replacement-contract-again/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2020/12/01/postal-service-delays-mail-truck-replacement-contract-again/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hammerlanelegends.com/news/us-postal-service-to-award-63b-contract-for-new-mail-truck-this-year-see-the-finalists\">https://www.hammerlanelegends.com/news/us-postal-service-to-award-63b-contract-for-new-mail-truck-this-year-see-the-finalists</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/RE5FGyq12ds\">https://youtu.be/RE5FGyq12ds</a> (Donut Media video)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/01/wkhs-stock-no-shoo-in-for-usps-contract/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/01/wkhs-stock-no-shoo-in-for-usps-contract/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/05/usps-karsan-hybrid-mail-truck/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/05/usps-karsan-hybrid-mail-truck/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/amp/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
