Need a rant. </p>\n\n<p>I believe Wealthsimple’s recent marketing campaigns are predatory. I know there is a start-up definition for predatory marketing with a slightly positive connotation - this is not the case here. They are intentionally misleading new entrants to the world of investing. </p>\n\n<p>———————————————————</p>\n\n<p>I deleted my Wealthsimple trade account a while ago (moved to QT). They have gamified investing while pursuing a very important initiative of making investing for everyone. I want to be clear that i endorse this pursuit... However, they have now lost the plot. Entirely. </p>\n\n<p>Some examples of practises I see all day every day on almost every platform:</p>\n\n<p>• Misleading: account chart always green. Demonstrating gains only on weekly - yearly basis</p>\n\n<p>• Language: trading versus investing. Purposefully oversimplifying the investment process </p>\n\n<p>• Tickers: purposefully advertising hot tech stocks and the like </p>\n\n<p>• Branding: it’s a young person in a tik tok like video telling you to just download the app and makes those buys and sells. It’s turned the pursuit of learning about businesses and buying good ones into a tik tok trend</p>\n\n<p>• Positioning: commercials trying to make the founder seem like an outsider who is standing up to the big guys - this is not the case. You are trading all the time, you can’t walk your dog without checking your account or making a trade </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on. It is so fucking annoying to see. </p>\n\n<p>What are people’s thoughts on this? Am I overreacting, this really scares me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
