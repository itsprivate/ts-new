According to my TDA account my trade price for those shares is $14.35. The stock is currently trading at $7.35 so I am thinking I want to sell 75 shares and take the loss to offset some gains I made this year collecting premiums from selling CC's. \n\nI am trying to understand the wash sale rule though. Investopedia says \"a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss  and within 30 days of the sale (either before or after), you purchase  the same—or a \"substantially identical\"—investment.\"\n\nThe \"either before of after\" part has me a little confused though. If I refrain from re-buying shares of this ticker until December I should avoid a wash sale in the after section. When it comes to the before part, I bought 4 shares @ $10.38 on 10/4, 9 shares @ $9.18 on 10/12, and 1 share @ 10.10 on 10/20. Would those purchases in any way be considered a wash sale or would my selling 75 shares today be enough to record the loss against my gains for the year as long as I don't rebuy shares for 30 days?\n\nI hope I've explained this adequately. Thank you in advance for your responses.",
