I’m less looking for advice on personal finance because i know there are better subreddits on that, but I wanted to raise conversation and see others’ insights on using a single family house as a practical vehicle for growing wealth in house equity. I’m familiar with the pros and cons of renting vs owning a home and i’ve read Rich Dad Poor Dad so no need to remind me that a home for many is actually a liability, i’m more thinking about let’s say the next 5-7 years whether it makes more sense to rent over an extended period of time and plow more money into equities or to build equity in a home by getting a mortgage. I know there’s lots of nuances to this and i consider myself to be a knowledgeable and reasonably sophisticated investor (at least with my own money) so i don’t need tips on how to allocate the difference necessarily, but the crux of my question boils down to over an intermediate 5-7 ish year time frame whether it’s more effective to build wealth generally in a diversified equities portfolio with increased marginal contributions rather than saving up for a downpayment on a house while continuing to rent, or save up for a down payment and use leverage from a mortgage to build real estate equity. Note, not looking for a house to ‘settle down’ in long term because i recognize the right house for a family has qualitative values not measurable or relevant to an investment analysis. Speaking purely from an investment stand point, i’m wondering whether a leveraged real estate investment (which is how i would think of a house if i bought one now) and all the costs associated as well as the equity in a booming real estate market compares with expected equity returns in medium term. part of my concern here is that neither stocks nor housing seem cheap, especially not in my area right now, but buying a house requires using leverage to enter a record hot asset class while continuing to rent and pouring more into stocks (in roth accounts and then taxable) feels like a more moderate decision. Would love to hear your all’s thoughts",
