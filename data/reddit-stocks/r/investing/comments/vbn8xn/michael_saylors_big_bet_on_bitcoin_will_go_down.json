That puts the company’s Bitcoin related losses at nearly $1 billion.\n\nMicroStrategy plunged 25% to $152.15 on Monday as part of broader route by cryptocurrency-exposed stocks. Shares of company have become highly correlated with Bitcoin since Saylor started adding the digital currency to its balance sheet in August 2020 as a hedge against inflation instead of holding cash in the corporate treasury.\n\nThe Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company was worth $1.2 billion on Aug. 10, 2020, the day before it announced its foray into crypto. Saylor appeared to be unfazed with the latest Bitcoin drop, sending tweets over Twitter that seemed to signify his confidence in the strategy.",
