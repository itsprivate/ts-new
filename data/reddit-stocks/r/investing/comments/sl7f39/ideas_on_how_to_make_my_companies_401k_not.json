My entire portfolio is getting churned at a ridiculous rate, the fees are already high, and if I want to move funds myself they charge me additional fees.

We've known each other for years at this point and are good friends. He (the boss) doesn't care as much about investing as I do but he understands my point about getting screwed by EJ. He run's a business along with having young kids so he doesn't have time for something like this so the solution needs to be simple and quick. \n\nSo ideally, what I want, is to have full control over it like a personal savings account or ira through whatever brokerage firm with cheap rates. I use vanguard normally. I'm told that's not possible without starting a business. Which I can do, if that's the ideal solution and it works the way I'm thinking.\n\nMy second choice is to just have it all thrown into an ETF that follows the S&amp;P 500. I think this is possible.
