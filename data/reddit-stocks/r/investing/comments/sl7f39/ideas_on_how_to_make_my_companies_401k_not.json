My entire portfolio is getting churned at a ridiculous rate, the fees are already high, and if I want to move funds myself they charge me additional fees. Not to mention they get kickbacks for putting my money into mutual funds that trail the s&amp;p 500 that do plenty of churning within the mutual fund itself.\n\nMy current situation is I work at a 3 person company, my boss and 2 employees including me. We've known each other for years at this point and are good friends. He (the boss) doesn't care as much about investing as I do but he understands my point about getting screwed by EJ. He run's a business along with having young kids so he doesn't have time for something like this so the solution needs to be simple and quick. \n\nSo ideally, what I want, is to have full control over it like a personal savings account or ira through whatever brokerage firm with cheap rates. I use vanguard normally. I'm told that's not possible without starting a business. Which I can do, if that's the ideal solution and it works the way I'm thinking.\n\nMy second choice is to just have it all thrown into an ETF that follows the S&amp;P 500. I think this is possible. If anybody has a better idea than these two though I'd appreciate hearing it.",
