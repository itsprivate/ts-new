It’s a very complex system with no underlying unifying logic, and nobody knows a whole lot about where anything is heading right now. \n\nRegardless, let’s go with the general consensus for arguments sake, that there will be a recession that sets stocks back around another 20% or so which would be 40% or so down from the ATH. \n\nFrom my point of view, the fundamentals don’t currently look great for either growth or value stocks. Considering the state of play, there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020, but it is. Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. \n\nBased on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. \n\nI definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&amp;P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&amp;P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. \n\nPersonally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. \n\nSince starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. \n\nMy logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. \n\nOn the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount.\n\nThe reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now.  It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. \n\nTLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks.\n\nThis is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.",
