The announced price change will go into effect for new members on February 18th. Existing members will see the fees upon their renewal date after March 25.\n\nThe company's net income nearly doubled last quarter compared to the same period the previous year, in large part because of the company's investment in EV startup Rivian (RIVN). Amazon reported $14.3 billion in net income for Q4, compared to $7.2 billion during the last three months of 2020.\n\n\"Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November,\" said the company's earnings statement.\n\nNet sales increased 9% to $137.4 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $125.6 billion in the same period last year.\n\nAmazon's Web Services unit brought in $17.78 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared to expectations of $17.23 billion.\n\nThe company's 1st quarter revenue forecast is for $112 billion-$117 billion. The Street was expecting guidance of $120 billion.\n\n“As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labor supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron. Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic,\" \"Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO said in the company's earnings release.\n\nDisclosure: I have long positions in $AMZN.\n\nWhat's very noteworthy is that they also booked an **$11.8B pre-tax gain from their stake in Rivian**: https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/, which accounted for more than *80%* of their quarterly profit",
