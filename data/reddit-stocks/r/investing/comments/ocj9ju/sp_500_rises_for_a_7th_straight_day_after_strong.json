The S&P 500 has now risen for seven consecutive sessions, its longest winning streak since August.  \n>  \n>Solid moves by major tech stocks helped support the overall market on Friday, with shares of Apple and Salesforce rising by nearly 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft jumped 2.2%.  \n>  \n>For the week, the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow climbed 1.7% and 1%, respectively.

So I think it was reassuring, in that sense,” Hatzius said on CNBC’s “[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/),” adding that the unemployment rate coming in higher than expected showed that the recovery still had a long way to go.  \n>  \n>The S&P 500 has now risen in five of the past six weeks, while the Nasdaq has gained in six of the past seven weeks.  \n>  \n>Even with the recent strength for stocks, market strategists say that uncertainty about the future of the Fed’s asset purchases and the upcoming earnings season could keep stocks from making major gains in the near term.  \n>  \n>“The market is still very much concerned about the Fed’s reaction function,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, adding that he thought there was still a lot of slack in the labor market.  \n>  \n>One weak spot for the markets this week was small caps, as the Russell 2000 slipped 1% on Friday to finish negative for the week.  \n>  \n>On Friday, shares of Boeing fell 1.3%, weighing on the Dow, after a 737 cargo plane made an [emergency landing off the coast of Honolulu](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/boeing-cargo-plane-makes-emergency-landing-in-ocean-off-honolulu-coast-faa-says.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=Main&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1625234441).
