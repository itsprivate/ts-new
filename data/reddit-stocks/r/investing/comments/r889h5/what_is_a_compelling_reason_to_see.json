Does nothing. Just cryptographed code.So you see the listed market price for a coin?\n\nBasically you can make them go up or down with bidding a higher price then the listed price and executing the trade. (establishing a new market price)\n\nSo someone launches a coin, then they open two or several accounts. And they simply buy the coin, by moving money from one account to the other. Pushing up the listed market price... So it was worth 0$ then now they've moved it up as much as they could with all the money they had.Obviously, if the market price gets high enough they can no longer afford to move the price up past $100 if they can only move $100 back and forth between two accounts, buying and selling it.\n\nSomeone else see the market price and says wowwww the price is going up I better buy. Then they simply sell them coins at the price. It gains momentum when people keep buying into it then when the price is high enough and they see not much more people are buying into it, they simply selll allllllll the coins they have stored pushing the price down to 0 to capture all of pending bid prices. And leaving people who bought these \"coins\" with a code with a listed market value of 0.This is essentially how \"rug pulls\" work. (i.e. the Squid Game token going to 0 and countless others)\n\nBut is bitcoin/ethereum etc. operating the same way????Here is a live trading dashboard of bitcoin: [https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC\\_USDT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT)See how trades are being executed multiple times a second, setting the listed price. I believe it is the same but on a much wider scale.\n\nLook here, at one point, bitcoin crashed to 8k from 65k, because one of their traders \"made a mistake\". source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-briefly-crashed-87-8-143639198.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-briefly-crashed-87-8-143639198.html)\n\nMore evidence of wash trading of bitcoin here, notice how bitcoin/ethereum listed price move in lockstep despite being \"completely different coins with completely different real world applications\" ? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtEYhwfbwiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtEYhwfbwiM)\n\nThey need you to buy into it for a reason. Hence, the heavily promoted lies, and aggressive marketing. Of course, they seem to need you to buy but never sell.\n\nWhen the price of bitcoin/ethereum tanked hard, a lot of these exchanges literally shutdown, there by locking people out of their accounts, preventing these people from selling and effectively stealing people's money... They've (coin base, kraken, kukoo etc.) have done this numerous times this year.\n\nSo I ask, if you're \"investing\" in this heavily marketed, energy draining, digital code, with no real world benefit to the economy are you really just playing the game - buy in and dump on others before the people with large amounts of money can dump on you or is there some kind of real economic driver driving up the price of these coins?",
