So even if the investor was diligent and did what he/ she was supposed to do they would have felt like they weren't making any progress, i.e. spinning the wheels for the first 22 years or so!  In fact, waiting for high growth at the end is NORMAL.  Folks get bummed out they aren't millionaires after about 1, 3, 5, even 10 years, but the above person ended up with 50% of all their future money to spend in the last 8 years or so (age 52-60 in this example).\n\nJust an observation that may help others.  The point being once  you have an set asset allocation your job is just to be a robot and save EACH month over and over again and don't worry about the total $$$ in your accounts.  The latter you won't appreciate until the end of the journey (20+ years later from when you started).\n\nIf anyone wants to visualize this play with the calculator on the SEC website: [https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)",
