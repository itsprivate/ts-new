I graduated in April 2020, and started working in May. My annual salary is around 80-85K. I just turned 25. </p>\n\n<p>I have around 50K ready to be used. I’m thinking of keeping 5k for emergency fund reasons. </p>\n\n<p>I was thinking of just putting in 45k spread across various ETFs in a roboadvisor. I’m a fairly new investor so I’m still learning.</p>\n\n<p>My friend on the other hand has made a lot of money with successful investments. He’s won big with Shopify, NVIDIA, Amazon, etc. Easily has over $300K now in assets. He kinda inspires me. Lol. He tells me that at the annual return rate of even 10% per year for ETF’s is nothing. Doesn’t excite him. But he told me I need to really do my research on individual stocks if I were to purchase them. </p>\n\n<p>On the OTHER hand, I was just thinking why not just save up money and move out eventually? But the thing is... my lifestyle at this current moment doesn’t really call for a drastic move like moving out. I live at my dads and I don’t pay rent/food. I do feel like sometimes I’m missing out? But that feeling goes away.</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think? Would love to hear advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
