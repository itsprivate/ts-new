A Fidelity advisor I met with recently suggested a two things that I am hoping to get some thoughts on.  \n\n1) He said in a taxable account, generally an indexed ETF is more tax efficient than an equivalent indexed mutual fund.  His explanation was that generally the ETF has less distributions than the equivalent mutual fund as as a result you pay less taxes on the ETF's distributions compared to the equivalent mutual fund and reap greater compounded returns over time.  \n\n2)  When it comes to the ROTH IRA, taxable distributions are no longer a concern (I agree)  so he suggested a handful of Fidelity 0% expense ratio mutual funds.  The reason being was that the 0% expense ratio is more beneficial compared to the ETF with a marginal expense ratio.  \n\nI know  everyone has their favorite stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds so I am hoping you can weigh in on the merit of 1 and 2 before reading on the rest.  Point #1 seems legit enough and I have found some research online to substantiate it.  Point #2 is a little more suspect to me as I can understand 0% ER is better than something greater than 0% but I am not sure if he is just trying to peddle Fidelity funds that might not track an index exactly and might not perform as well.  \n\nWith all that said, he suggested a handful of iShare ETFs for the brokerage:  IVV (S&amp;P 500) , IJR (Small Cap) , IJH (Mid Cap) , and IVW (S&amp;P 500 Growth) (some simple research showed that these have lower expense ratios than SPY, QQQ, and some of the vanguard equivalents but just with less volume which I guess I am okay with except I was hoping to write some covered called on them from time to time)  \n\nHe suggested 3 each  0% Expense Ratio Mutual funds for the ROTH IRA:  FNILX (Large Cap Index) FZILX (International), FZIPX  (Extended Mid to Small Cap Market) \n\nThanks for any thoughts or feedback!",
