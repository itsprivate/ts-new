I did a bit of a quick research into this recently. But first, a quick recap of what Warren Buffet says about investing in IPOs:\n\n* Warren Buffet has always been very vocal about his views on IPOs. His thought process is that \"*there are always better businesses to buy than IPOs*\". He always compares IPOs with other alternatives in the market, and so far, he has not found a strong justification for investing in an IPO versus another solid business at a good price.\n* Buffet also dislikes the fact in IPOs, there are commissions that go to the stock salesmen, remember that IPOs are executed by investment banks so there is a push to sell IPOs like any other product, He likes to buy stocks where \"*no one is making any money on the sale*\".\n\nI'd like to share with you some stats that I put together. Bear in mind the following:\n\n* I took the [full list](https://www.iposcoop.com/scoop-track-record-from-2000-to-present/) of IPOs in the last 20 years from iposcoop.com.\n* Filtered only companies that went public between years 2000 and 2015, so that at a minimum we have at least 5-6 years of post IPO performance.\n* Calculated annualized performance using stock price from the first day close of IPO and current stock's price at the time this video was made.\n* Performance from companies that are not currently trading were excluded.\n* List [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/102ArUr35s1MLfyMm6rwnqhCvSo-L5f4JrmHAUlyk1pg/edit#gid=1482717621) for your reference.\n\n**Results**:\n\n* Total number of companies: 1396\n* 45% of the companies (qty 616) have had negative annualized performance.\n* 14% of the companies (qty 189) had sub 5% performance.\n* **Almost 60% of IPOs between 2000 and 2015 underperformed the market.**\n\nI also came across an [academic study](https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf) on Initial Public Offerings by Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the Warrington College of Business in the University of Florida. One piece of information that caught my attention in his paper is Figure number 2, labeled Percentage of IPOs with negative EPS. If you check the figure, you'll notice how in recent years **over 75% percent of the companies that have gone public have had negative earnings.**\n\nWhen you buy shares of companies, you get a piece of the ownership and therefore a piece of the earnings . Well, with IPOs in the recent years, in 75% of the cases there is no earnings for your shares. You are literally investing with the expectation that the company will become profitable, which by the way is already factored into the price that you are paying. So if these new public companies fail to turn a profit, or perhaps if their path to profitability takes longer, the stock price will suffer. Your only chance is the company continuously beating expectations. Not to mention that you don't even have enough years of financial reports to build a solid foundation for analysis.\n\nHope this helps. I don't want to discourage anyone though, a lot of people have made good money on IPOs, but base on the data it's pretty obvious that the average investor should stay away from them.",
