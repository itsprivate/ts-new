The foundation of this concept is solid and from a perspective of an investor, it couldn't be better. Adobe is here the template. \n\nFrom the perspective of a farmer the equipment is a part of his production has has to have a certain availability while in use. The venture to buy such equipment has high capital costs. Like in other sectors, a farmer wants to optimize it's production and any lack of availability of equipment has a financial impact. A breakdown of equipment of more than a day in a business depending on weather and biological processes, can turn agriculture into a bad business. \n\n  -  The service by John Deere is done by dealership and a farmer depends on the relationship to a dealership. This removes John Deere out of the relationship and John Deere gets blamed for all the problems a dealership is causing\n\n  - The issue of farmers don't get service when they have a breakdown of equipment is serious. It's looking like large parts of agriculture doesn't get guaranteed reaction times for a service.\n\n  - [It's looking like spare parts aren't always available when equipment is in use](https://greenfarmparts.com/parts-shortages-and-order-delays/), which reduces the availability of equipment\n \n  - John Deere thinned out dealerships and didn't replaced service. Equipment has sometimes to be transported for more than 50miles. \n\n - The software has a bad reputation, but is a core of the business model. John Deere was not able to make safeguards against data theft until recently. Such a culture of negligence points on business practices in general, which should the leadership be punished for. \n\nThe optimization of business processes is a necessity, but defining optimization by delivering a bad service, when it's part of the core business, is bad practice. As a result\n\n  - Farmers are starting to call for a right to repair, which would cause a breakdown of the business model.\n\n  - Any developing competition with a better service could cause a serious breakdown of revenue.  I'm thinking here of course on China. \n\n Agriculture is an industry and will be more industrialized in the near future. Farmers or better corps will put the value of equipment from John Deere under a microscope. This value is defined by the price of the product **and** the quality of service. When dealerships can't provide a sufficient service, John Deere has to develop new ideas. Until then, I'm considering the business model of John Deere as unsustainable in the long term.",
