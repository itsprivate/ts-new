Historically, forward P/E peaked around 16x to 17x. [Ed Yardeni](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf) currently has 2023 S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates of 250. So, if you assume that earnings meet 2022 estimates and 2023 estimates don't change much over the course of the year (a big assumption, I know), and you take your 2023 estimate of 250 and a normal-ish fwd P/E ratio of 17x, you then have a downside case scenario with a year end price target of 4,250. That's only a 3.4% decline from where we already are. It's simply not worth selling or making large changes to your portfolio (and missing potential upside) when the downside is only 3.5% from where we are today, 1/22/2022.\n\nAnd that's the downside. Currently, 2022 earnings estimates are at about 225, so with a 4,400 S&amp;P 500 we're at a 19.5x FWD P/E ratio. Last year, we beat the early earnings estimates from January by over 15%. Also, there's potential for FWD P/E to remain elevated and not retrace all the way to 17x. If you assume we only drop to an 18x FWD P/E ratio, and 2023 earnings estimates shift up by only 5% to 262.5, that gives us a 2022 year end price of 4,725 which is a 7% increase from where we are today...a completely normal 12 month equity return.\n\nAnd remember that even companies like Netflix that are giving bad guidance are still crushing earnings estimates. Additionally, Netflix raised it's price by $2 the week before it got killed for earnings. I highly doubt a significant amount of people are going to cancel over that $2 increase. This is to say, there is real potential for earnings to meet or exceed expectations.\n\nThere will certainly be volatility along the way, and even if the fed makes a \"policy error\", they are going to just pivot. But I believe Powell is going to successfully avoid having to do a huge pivot like in late 2018/early 2019 where rates went up too quickly, credit markets froze, and the fed had to reverse course.\n\nOverall, markets are going nowhere fast. There is just no way that with nosebleed valuations and rising rates, the market is going to have another double digit year in 2022. This is why Is old $20,000 in stocks and maxed out 2021/2022 Series I bonds in December and January. Even still, there is no better alternative, and with inflation as high as it is and rates near zero, TINA.",
