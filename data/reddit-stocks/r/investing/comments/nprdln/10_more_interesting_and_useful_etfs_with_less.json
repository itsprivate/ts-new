  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As a sequel to &quot;10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM&quot;, I&#39;m back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people&#39;s attention. I think it&#39;s worth looking further to see what&#39;s out there.</p>\n\n<p>Starting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP\">https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP</a> . &quot;Growth at a Reasonable Price&quot; (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or &quot;TTM&quot; net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP&#39;s historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It&#39;s designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Moving on to Factor ETFs,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL\">https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL</a> .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.</p></li>\n<li><p>FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA\">https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA</a> .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.</p></li>\n<li><p>JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753\">https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753</a> .  JVAL&#39;s index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.</p></li>\n<li><p>FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal\">https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal</a> .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they&#39;re less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity&#39;s offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger&#39;s favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.</p></li>\n<li><p>JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761\">https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761</a> .  JPMorgan handles &quot;quality&quot; a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They&#39;re grouped into categories for &quot;profitability&quot;, &quot;solvency and financial risk&quot;, and &quot;earnings quality&quot;.  Loosely stated, they&#39;re looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let us not forget commodities,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, <a href=\"https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf\">https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf</a> .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it&#39;s almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and &quot;flat&quot; (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.</p></li>\n<li><p>CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund\">https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund</a> .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Seeking dividends?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, <a href=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy\">https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy</a> . A new offering from Schwab, it&#39;s the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Finally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, <a href=\"https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html\">https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html</a> .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I&#39;m including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it&#39;s volatile.  And it&#39;s not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can&#39;t be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it&#39;s actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK&#39;s funds.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Disclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
