If the proposal is approved by the stockholders, Atossa does not intend to issue any of the newly authorized shares of common stock for the purpose of raising capital in the nine months following approval of the proposal at a price less than $10 per share. The newly authorized shares of common stock are intended to be used at any time to complete and/or support acquisitions, collaborations, partnerships and licensing transactions.”\n* The fact they’re requesting authorization of common stock like this means there’s obviously something big happening in the backend.\n* \"Through the completion of capital raising transactions and the exercise of warrants, Atossa has grown its cash balances quarter over quarter for the past three quarters, ending the second quarter 2021 with $142.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.\"\n* The latest corporate presentation PDF [https://atossatherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Final-ATOS-Investor-Presentation-August-9-2021\\_HF-2.pdf](https://atossatherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Final-ATOS-Investor-Presentation-August-9-2021_HF-2.pdf)\n\n**Expenses**\n\nTotal operating expenses were approximately $10,534,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021\n\nR&D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2021, were approximately $5,177,000\n\nG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2021, were approximately $5,357,000\n\nCash burn rate is at $21,068,000 every 6 months.\n\nSo they have enough cash on hand for a minimum of **3 years** without any dilution or funding.\n\nLook at all the institutions that opened up or added to their positions. A lot of new reports this month. Here are a few large names and buys.\n\n**New Positions Reported:**\n\n* Group One Trade – 1,644,488 Shares\n* Nuveen Asset Management, - 1,097,131 Shares\n* Millennium Management 1,666,911 Shares\n* Bank of Nova Scotia – 348,698 Shares\n\n**Increased Positions Reported:**\n\n*  Northern Trust Corp - 1,1231,852 Shares\n*  Vanguard Group Inc – 5,762,626 Shares\n* Geode Capital Management – 1,968,745 Shares\n*  BlackRock Inc – 8.954,293 Shares\n* Bank of New York Mellon Corp – 465,572 Shares\n\nTo those saying the Blackrock investments aren't substantial, they literally own over 10% of the company now. They have been buying Atossa before the Russell inclusion.\n\nLet’s talk about the timeline on Phase 3 for Endoxifen. FDA 505(b)(2) may bring Endoxifen to market without the need of Phase 3.\n\nAs discussed in this video: [https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4](https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4)\n\n>\\[Interviewer\\]can you shed some colour on what maybe a phase 3 study may look like … since the FDA is already familiar with Tamoxifen and it’s outcomes…?  \n>  \n>\\[Dr Quay\\] .. first of all it’s very hard to answer that, but I think one of the things we have talked about in the past is that there’s a pathway called 505(b)(2) which allows you to submit applications for metabolites of drugs that are already approved. There are some special aspects of that package … you’re allowed to reference the data with the primary drug, you’re typically allowed to do one instead of two controlled clinical trials, and you typically get 7 years of market exclusivity independent of your patent situation. So it’s a nice model and we’ve publicly said that this is our target. We’ve obviously not had conversations with the FDA about all of the aspects of our programs qualifying for 505(b)(2), but I mean I think that’s how I would answer that question.\n\n**What is 505(b)(2) ?**\n\nThe 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) is a streamlined NDA process in which the applicant relies upon one or more investigations conducted by someone other than the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained right of reference. In other words, the 505(b)(2) pathway enables investigators and/or manufacturers to apply for approval without having to repeat all the drug development work done for an innovator drug.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [https://fintel.io/so/us/atos](https://fintel.io/so/us/atos](https://fintel.io/so/us/atos)\n* [https://fintel.io/so/us/atos/blackrock](https://fintel.io/so/us/atos/blackrock](https://fintel.io/so/us/atos/blackrock)\n* [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/13/2280555/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Provides-Corporate-Update-and-Information-about-Upcoming-Stockholder-Meeting.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/13/2280555/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Provides-Corporate-Update-and-Information-about-Upcoming-Stockholder-Meeting.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/13/2280555/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Provides-Corporate-Update-and-Information-about-Upcoming-Stockholder-Meeting.html)",
