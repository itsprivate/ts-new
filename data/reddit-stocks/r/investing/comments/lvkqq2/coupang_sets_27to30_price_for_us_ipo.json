The company hadn’t revealed the initial public offering’s expected price range or number of shares in its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406838-coupang-files-for-1-billion-ipo?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">original filing</a> last month.</li>\n<li>At $27 to $30 a share, Coupang would see a $46B to $51B market cap. That’s way up from a $9B valuation seen when the company last staged a private fundraising round in 2018.</li>\n<li>Coupang was founded in 2010 by Harvard Business School dropout Bom Kim, and is generally ranked as South Korea’s No. 1 e-commerce platform.</li>\n<li>The company aims to beat Amazon and other competitors with several unique features, such one-day and same-day delivery, and even what Coupang calls “Dawn Delivery.” That’s a program where orders placed by midnight arrive the next morning by 7 a.m.</li>\n<li>Coupang also boasts ecofriendly packaging, with 75% of deliveries coming without boxes. Instead, the company uses “eco-bags” that it picks up later and reuses.</li>\n<li>Lastly, Coupang promises “friction-free returns,” allowing customers to simply sign up for returns online and leave goods at their doors without boxing up and labeling items or paying for postage.</li>\n<li>“Our mission is to create a world where customers wonder: ‘How did I ever live without Coupang?’” the company wrote in its IPO prospectus.</li>\n<li>Coupang added in its S-1 that revenues have grown 400% in less than three years, from $900M in 2018’s first quarter to $3.8B in 2020’s fourth period.</li>\n<li>However, Coupang lost $474.9M in 2020, although that’s way down from the $1.1B of red ink it had in 2018.</li>\n<li>SoftBank’s Vision Fund was an early backer of the firm and will own about 37% of Coupang’s Class A stock following the IPO. Other pre-IPO investors include BlackRock and Greenoaks Capital Management.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
