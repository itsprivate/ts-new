I'm using VTI as an example here because it's the ETF with the highest allocation (~30%) in the Betterment portfolio.\n\n\nMy taxable account is doing great with the same exact investments, so I called and they assured me nothing was wrong with the account.\n\n\nLong story short: I could have thrown a dart at any large cap ETF and had better returns in the past 6 months.
