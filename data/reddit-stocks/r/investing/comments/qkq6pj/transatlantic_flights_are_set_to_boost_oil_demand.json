Bloomberg Intelligence analyst  Fernando Valle also expects more than a quarter million barrels of daily  crude consumption coming back, thanks to less restrictions on global  vaccinated travelers in the U.S. and Europe.\n\n“We’ve picked up a lot on domestic travel and should  pick up more than 250,000 barrels a day with easing restrictions on  vaccinated travelers,” Valle said. \n\nAir  travel remains a weak spot in the oil market’s recovery from an  unprecedented crash triggered by the pandemic last year, after flights  were grounded worldwide and commuters everywhere started working from  home. Air routes between the U.S. and Europe have historically been the  world’s most profitable for business travel. \n\nUnder the new rules  taking effect Nov. 8, travelers from countries with low supplies of  vaccines who aren’t traveling on tourist visas, and those under 18, will  be exempt from the vaccine requirement.\n\nGeorge Dix, an oil analyst at Energy Aspects, sees  the boost from the new rules at 200,000 barrels a day of increased oil  consumption this quarter.\n\n“We expect the main  boost to be from U.S.-Europe flights as U.S.-Latin America was already  operating close to pre-virus levels, and several other countries in  other regions are still some way off from opening up for international  flights,” Dix said.\n\nFor airlines, the recovery is coming with a higher cost for jet fuel, denting their earnings.\n\n[Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/flights-are-set-to-boost-oil-demand-by-quarter-million-barrels?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-markets&utm_content=markets&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter).",
