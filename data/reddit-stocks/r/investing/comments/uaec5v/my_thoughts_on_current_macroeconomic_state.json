  "selftext": "So the Federal Reserve is going to hike rates to cool the economy and inflation. Inflation itself will tamp down demand, and so will the rate hikes. Housing prices are already inflated, add in some rate hikes, the demand for housing should drop some, or at least not go up anymore. \n\nUnemployment numbers suggests a strong economy right now. So the rate hikes should not cause too much issue. At most mild recession.\n\nI am thinking of 2 scenarios regarding the stock market:\n\n1) rate hikes till neutral (2%) or slightly above neutral (2.5-3%) and inflation gets controlled. Inflation and rate hikes are milder than believed. Stock market stabilizes and rebounds from current level and the doomsday scenario that some are parroting here, doesn't occur. \n\n2) rate hikes way higher than neutral because inflation hard to control, PE compresses, stock market crashes. Inflation then gets under control and US economy enters severe recession. The Fed starts to lower rates again, PE expands again, those companies that survived the recession would see their stock price go back again.\n\nI think in either scenario the stock market will do fine over the medium term, whether its 2 or 5 years, and well in the longer term. If someone wants to invest today instead of waiting until the picture on rate hike and inflation clears up, they should not use margin at all and they should not use options, unless the stock market does crash and the price of good companies becomes absurdly good. But they must be absurdly good that only then do leveraging thru margin or options becomes far less risky and far more rewarding. \n\nOtherwise, simply having cash invested will allow you to take advantage of scenario 1 if things aren't as bad as thought, or ride out scenario 2. Having 100% cash will allow you to take advantage of scenario 2 but you may miss out on a good portion of scenario 1.",
