The latter was recently among stocks that can possibly beat inflation.\n\nRight now I’m looking into going for some [First Majestic](https://www.firstmajestic.com/) not just for the gold but also since they have the most expensive silver stock out there. Another one would be Equinox Gold since they are showing a lot of potential too. Their operations are not deterred by the pandemic, so they are constantly producing and is possibly headed for a breakout.\n\nFor explorations, I think [Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) has a lot of room to grow. They already started drilling and have released good results in the recent months. The cash burn is so low and the company is set up for a long timeline. So far that’s the only one I’m going to look into since they’re already showing promise in their drilling results. I also want to be safe so I’m more focused on the bigger ones since they’re more certain and I don’t think I’d lose that much on them.\n\nRight now I have only invested on the bigger producers and is still looking into the others that i have mentioned. I need your thoughts. Is it smart to invest on gold right now since there’s a lot going on with the prices?",
