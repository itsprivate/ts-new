Suddenly Cathie Wood of ARK is adding it to her ARKK and ARKG funds</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile they make no money and have no real “product”. So is this a big bubble? What’s going on?</p>\n\n<p>My belief is that BEAM has the longest runway for the development of new therapeutics based on CRISPR technology because they have the BEST technology.</p>\n\n<p>The CRISPR technology that EDIT, CRSP, and NTLA use is essentially first generation CRISPR which cannot be targeted everywhere in the genome and has off-target effects.</p>\n\n<p>BEAM is the brainchild of David Liu, a Harvard scientist who utilizes forward evolution to engineer next-generation CRISPR. BEAM is specifically licensed to use Dr. Liu’s CRISPR technology, specifically his “base editors” and “prime editors.” Making a long story short, BEAM has the technology to edit anywhere in the genome with less off-target effects than the tech of NTLA, EDIT, and CRSP. Also, as you may know, EDIT, NTLA, and CRSP have had longstanding patent battles over their technology. BEAM has no such issue.</p>\n\n<p>So what’s BEAM’s plan?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>They can correct the ACTUAL sickle cell mutation that is present in patients. CRSP and the others are using their technology to turn on fetal hemoglobin production to bypass the mutation.</p></li>\n<li><p>In a collaboration with Verve, they showed they could correct the PCSK9 mutation in primates and PERMANENTLY lower blood cholesterol for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></li>\n<li><p>They also show data correcting the actual patient mutations in several liver diseases.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>David Liu just had a paper in Nature showing they could correct the mutation that causes progeria, which is the disease where you rapidly age. </li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is the stock a bubble that may collapse? I hope so. I’ll buy the dip.</p>\n\n<p>David Liu also has an agriculture company called Pairwise Plants in which they want to use the technology to gene edit crops, etc. If it goes public, I’ll be all over it.</p>\n\n<p>I am LONG BEAM. This is a little primer for the stock. Happy to discuss more in-depth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
