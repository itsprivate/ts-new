Also with the big correction in feb 2020 gold also went down quite alot. Anybody can explain why this happens?</p>\n\n<p>And no, this has nothing to do with money flowing from gold into bitcoin. The gold market is still x times bigger than bitcoin and when monday and tuesday the stock market and gold went down, so did bitcoin so that&#39;s not the reason.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I read somewhere is that it might have to do with (leveraged) hedge funds getting more margin calls when equity markets go down and in order to post cash collateral they have to sell other assets like gold.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure if that makes sense or is even the main reason so why is gold selling off, which is even more surpring since gold has also always functioned as inflation hedge. With investors worrying about inflation lately you would think gold would benifit but even that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
