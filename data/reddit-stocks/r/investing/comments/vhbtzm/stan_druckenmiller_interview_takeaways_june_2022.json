He has good returns, 2) He invests across most asset classes - public equities and debt, currencies, commodities, private equity and debt - and 3) he is a macro-first investor, meaning he tries to understand where the world will be in 18 months and invest around that future world. \n\nDruckenmiller recently sat down with John Collison, co-founder of Stripe, to talk about the macro environment in the US, and a little bit globally. Given Druckenmiller seems to have had useful insights over the last 40+ years when it comes to macro, I thought the conversation was interesting.\n\nSome selected notes from the conversation are below, but this is not meant to be an inventory of everything discussed, so you can check out [the hour-long discussion here](https://flight.beehiiv.net/clicks/SnVFRUpISkVJdkVFRnRFRUlLSkdKR0pDSkZGdEV5RXlKSkpKSkpFeEpMSXlKSEpHSkhJRUlIRXhJRkl5SXdFeUpKSURKR0lGSUtGeUpJRndFd0ZKSkZISkd2R0xKTElFSEpJeEhERUVFdkVFSkNJeUpGSkdIeUlMSUdFRUZ0RUVGR0ZERkdGTEZHRkhGQ0ZGRXdGSkZJSURJSUV3RkdGRkZMRkRFd0lFSUdGQ0lFRXdJSEZGRkNJREZMRkdGQ0ZMSUhGRUlJSUhFRUV2RUVKQ0pISUVJdklMSUZJREpHSUxJeUl4SHlJTElHRUVGdEVFRklJSEZERkZGREZMRkZJSUV3RkhGRUZMRkdFd0ZHRktGRkZHRXdJRUZMRkVGSkV3RkxJSEZKSUhJRUZJSURGREZESUlGRUZGRUVFdkVFSklJTEpGSUxKR0h5SUxJR0VFRnRGRkZKRktGR0ZKRkhGRkp3):\n\n* **Two Inflation-Related Historical Precedents**  \n\n\n1. When inflation has gotten over 5% historically, it has never come back down without the Fed Funds rate getting above inflation (Fed Funds is currently \\~1.5%, versus inflation of 8%)\n\n* 2) When inflation has gotten over 5% historically, it has never come back down without a recession\n* **Surprised by the Current Environment**  \n\n* He suggests that the current macro environment - high inflation, super-low bond yields, and an economy weakening - requires extreme humility on the part of the investor, because there is not really a precedent in history for this situation\n* Inflation - he was surprised by how high inflation got and how slow the Fed was to react\n* Declining growth company valuations - he expected the bubble to burst, but he is seeing more pain than he expected\n* **What Are You Watching?**  \n\n* Housing is a leading indicator industry, and expecting to see that react to rising interest rates; already seeing homebuilder's valuations get hit\n* Transportation is also leading; some transportation companies are trading off strongly despite strong earnings\n* Retail is a slightly delayed leading indicator, and starting to see some pain; during COVID, retail became more or less 100% of the consumer wallet share, as opposed to 85% pre-COVID; expect there should be a reset\n* The bond market used to be a good signal – the 10-year treasury is the most important marker in the world – but over the last ten years, it has become less useful to watch because the Fed is controlling prices\n* **What Would He Tell a 20-Year-Old Getting into Investing?**  \n\n* Do not invest in the present – have a vision of the world 18+ months from now and invest around that\n* If you don’t love it, do something else\n* Encourage them to look at how all the asset classes flow into each other\n* Look into potential disruption for blockchain technologies *\\[ note: that doesn't mean cryptocurrencies, it means what use cases blockchain-related technology can make better \\]*\n* **How Does Work Ethic Impact Success?**  \n\n* You must be attracted to the game – lazy people become very driven if they find the right game; so it is more about finding what you get excited about as opposed to finding the will to force a better work ethic\n* “I don’t think I have a strong work ethic; I am just passionate about this specific thing”\n* **Put All Your Eggs in One Basket / Hot and Cold**  \n\n* Schools teach that diversification results in safer returns – doesn’t agree with that – most people get in trouble with stale longs or stale shorts where they are not paying attention *\\[ note: I think this depends on what your investing goals are / if you are investing as your profession; Warren Buffett suggests the average person puts their money in the S&amp;P500 and leave it there, which is very much a diversified portfolio \\]*\n* Sizing is 70-80% of the equation; if you have conviction and do a 2% bet, you will have poor returns; you get outsized returns by making a lot when you are right and losing less when you are wrong\n* Know when you are “hot and cold,” meaning know when you are getting things right and when you are getting them wrong. If you are getting things wrong – stop and take a break; if you are getting bets right, be confident that you might be seeing something special and keep going  \n\n   * Druckenmiller took 4 months off in the early 2000s when he was “cold” (he didn’t look at a newspaper or TV for that time), and he credits that time off to reset as why he got 40% returns the next year\n   * “I will go to the grave believing that if I had sat in my room looking at the screen… \\[with\\] my brain too messed up in May… it was by stepping aside and clearing my head that I had the gumption to do it; I need those 4 months”\n\n[Taken from here](https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/butwhatfor-four-friday-no-043)",
