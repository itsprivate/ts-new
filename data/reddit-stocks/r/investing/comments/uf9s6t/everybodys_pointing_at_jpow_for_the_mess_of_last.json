When Corona was gaining speed, people were begging for QE's, keep the printer on, which I understood, and made sense in a way. Investor would go apeshit crazy both in Europe and the US if the ECB or FED would even slightly mention an interest hike. I remember quotes \"all that it takes to keep the economy going\" and \" we are not even thinking about thinking to raise the rates\". So investors would be pleased , and money kept flowing, with several rounds of stimulus checks in the US. Even under political pressure ( Trump also pushed this). People screaming and shreeking if the FED would even have a \"hawkish\" tone on this. JPOW being called incompetent if he would not understand the needs of the economy. The FED initially wasn't a big fan of just keeping the printer on without limits and had reservations.\n\nNow of course, with all the supply chain issues, shortages and cash flowing around obviously inflation is rising, partly to feed the growing economy and also because of other factors like people spending more etc.  Now the FED announced the hikes, and people are still shreeking. I understand that having higher interests, those hikes will not benefit the labour market, but something has to be done to keep the inflation under control, no? I AM NOT DEFENDING JPOW OR THE FED, quotes like \"inflation is transitory\" were weird to me, and I have the personal feeling they are making decision to save their own seats as well. I am also aware that it is much more complex than this. For example, interests hikes are probaly necessary, but what was the right timing?TLDR: : the FED caused a river of money to flow, people were happy, and now that the consequences are there in the form of inflation, people are pissed that the FED is proposing interest rate hikes.\n\nWhat do you all think?",
