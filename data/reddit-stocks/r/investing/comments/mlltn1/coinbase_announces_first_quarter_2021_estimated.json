Put simply, this company makes BANK.</p>\n\n<p>Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing&#39;s rise, and we can&#39;t extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.</p>\n\n<p>But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN&#39;s annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I&#39;ve calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won&#39;t be participating in it. It&#39;s pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days</p>\n\n<p>But let&#39;s say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)</p>\n\n<p>The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) &lt; $100 Billion.</p>\n\n<p>Crazy.</p>\n\n<p>(I hope you all know what &quot;the thing&quot; is)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
