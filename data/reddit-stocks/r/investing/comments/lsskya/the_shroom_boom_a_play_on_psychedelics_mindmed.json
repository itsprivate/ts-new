Going public will allow MindMed to continue developing clinical trials and to access additional institutional capital to further build its pipeline of clinical trials for psychedelic-inspired medicines.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://healthmode.com/\">HealthMode</a></p>\n\n<p><em>MindMed will acquire HealthMode through the issuance of 82,508 multiple voting shares of MindMed (equivalent to 8,250,836 subordinate voting shares which, at yesterday&#39;s closing price of CAD $5.13, puts the value of HealthMode at approximately CAD $41,254,180) and the payment of approximately CAD $300,000 in cash.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Karlin, who will serve as Chief Medical Officer of MindMed, previously <strong>held several leadership roles at Pfizer&#39;s Neuroscience Research Unit, ultimately serving as Head of Clinical, Informatics, and Regulatory Strategy for Digital Medicine. He is board certified in Psychiatry, Addiction Medicine, and Clinical Informatics.</strong> Dr. Karlin previously was the co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of Column Health, a network of technology enabled clinics that was an early leader in value-based care for substance use disorders and mental illness.<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-new-device-designed-reduce-sleep-disturbance-related-nightmares-certain-adults\">He recently led the development efforts for NightWare, which received FDA clearance for its smartwatch-based treatment for PTSD-related nightmares.</a> Dr. Karlin is also an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>COVID-19 Research</strong></p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04326309?cond=COVID-19&amp;amp;map_cntry=US&amp;amp;map_state=US%3ANY&amp;amp;draw=3#contacts\">Audio Data Collection for Identification and Classification of Coughing</a></em></p>\n\n<p>The idea behind it is that “coughs aren’t all the same,” says Dr. Daniel Karlin </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coughmode.com/\">CoughMode</a>\n&gt;Help Research into COVID-19 Donate Your Cough to Science</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Users who install the app — whose website urges users to “Donate your cough to science!” — can start it when they begin to cough and upload the sound to HealthMode, which will analyze it for characteristics such as volume, duration and frequency. Their health will then be monitored with weekly questionnaires.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>HealthMode’s apps, which were developed before the coronavirus outbreak, are typically used by pharmaceutical companies and laboratories conducting clinical trials or public health surveys. The company has a companion app to CoughMode that looks for symptoms of coronavirus in the gastrointestinal tract, which accounts for an unknown fraction of infections and may be present with or without respiratory symptoms. It works by uploading pictures of the user’s stool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On November 25th, 2020, they announced <a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/mindmed-announces-25-million-bought-deal-public-offering-851411474.html\">$25 Million Bought Deal Public Offering</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The net proceeds of the Offering will be used for investment in the digital medicine division, additional microdosing R&amp;D as well as general working capital.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Microdosing</strong></p>\n\n<p>MindMed is collaborating with <a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/\">Maastricht University</a> in the Netherlands to undertake a Phase 2a clinical trial for microdosing LSD for adult ADHD. The proof-of-concept study is planned to take place at two trial sites, including Maastricht University. The principal investigator of the study is Kim Kuypers, one of the world’s top psychedelics microdosing clinical researchers.</p>\n\n<p>They’re creating a new paradigm for mental health care that incorporates both psychedelic-assisted therapy and non-hallucinogenic take-home medicines to help patients overcome and break through.</p>\n\n<p><em>LSD/MDMA Combo</em>\n- With this innovative treatment paradigm, they are looking to bring the participants outside the bounds of their everyday perceptions, facilitating new states of consciousness and flexibility. Combining MDMA and LSD may enhance the positive effects of LSD by inducing a positive psychological state with MDMA which is an empathogen to help counteract some known negative or less positive aspects of LSD</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legalization of Psychedelics</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>COLORADO</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In 2019, Denver <a href=\"https://footprintstorecovery.com/addiction-treatment-locations/denver-colorado/denver-psilocybin/\">decriminalized</a> magic mushrooms.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The initiative also establishes a review panel to analyze the public safety, administrative, fiscal and health impacts of the decriminalization of mushrooms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>OREGON</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In November 2020, following elections, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/11/04/oregon-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-magic-mushrooms-as-more-states-ease-drug-laws.html\">becomes first state to legalize magic mushrooms as more states ease drug laws in &#39;psychedelic renaissance&#39;</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>first state to legalize the active ingredient in so-called magic mushrooms on an election night that saw more states ease restrictions on drugs across the country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>WASHINGTON</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, in Novmber, a two-track effort to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-magic-mushrooms-result/2020/11/03/bb929e86-1abc-11eb-bb35-2dcfdab0a345_story.html?outputType=amp\">Allow Psychedelic Mushrooms In Washington State</a> launches amid broader Drug Decrim push.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One seeks to utilize existing administrative mechanisms to expand access to psilocybin mushrooms for therapeutic use by patients in end-of-life care. The other, a proposed ballot initiative on track for 2022, would put Washington on par with Oregon, decriminalizing small-scale possession of all drugs and legalizing mushrooms for broader therapeutic use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HAWAII</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In late January, Hawaii announces push to legalize <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/hawaii-could-legalize-psychedelic-mushroom-therapy-under-new-senate-bill/\">Psychedelic Mushroom Therapy</a> under new Senat Bill.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The measure, if approved, would direct the state Department of Health to “establish designated treatment centers for the therapeutic administration of psilocybin and psilocyn,” two psychoactive substances produced by certain fungi; It would also remove the two compounds from the state’s list of Schedule I controlled substances and create a seven-person psilocybin review panel to assess the impacts of the policy change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>FLORIDA</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, a Florida lawmaker aims to <a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/florida-bill-aims-to-legalize-medical-psychedelic-mushrooms-11835699\">Legalize Psychedelic Mushrooms by 2022</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Modeled after a recent voter-approved initiative in Oregon, the proposal from State Rep. Michael Grieco, a Democrat who represents Miami Beach in the state Legislature, represents the first serious push for legal access to psilocybin on the East Coast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The stigma around psychedelics/mushrooms continue to change dramatically. Imo, Mindmed is first in line to benefit as legislation continues to changes in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>The yearly chart presents a potential C&amp;H w/ strong support forming ~3.30usd. (&gt;70% oversold on the monthly) <em>RSI curling</em> ..Imo, anything under 3.5usd is a <strong>STRONG</strong> buy. </p>\n\n<p>Initial PT —&gt; ~4.20usd</p>\n\n<p>Stay safe &amp; GLTA!</p>\n\n<p><em>I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
