A built in buffer against loss or just pure profit.</strong></p>\n\n<p>as long as this spread between the stock remains the value appears to be very significant. Going off of yesterdays close:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Approximate.....</p>\n\n<p>10 shares = $57 additional profit</p>\n\n<p>100 shares = $570 additional profit</p>\n\n<p>1000 shares = $5,700 additional profit</p>\n\n<p>10,000 shares = $57,00 additional profit</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If this trend continues there is a built in buffer against loss as well a significant upside if TLRL and APHA keep trending upward and the spread remains the same. I am surprised more people have not jumped on this especially with the news on how US appears to be position cannibus legalization nationally and APHA is one of the first cannibus companies to actually produce a profit at the last earning report in 2020! I am not an investment advisor, but this seems like a great deal to me. Definitely check my math.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
