In the interview he calls for $PFE and $MRNA to have a boom by Q3, and are expected to deliver 500-600 million vaccine doses. He also thinks that by then, the states will have smoothed out the logistics of deploying the vaccine to the population.</p>\n\n<p>My analysis is to pay attention to these companies. $PFE, $MRNA, $AZN, $TMO, $UPS, and $FDX.</p>\n\n<p>Thermo-Fisher is a science equipment company, that produces deep freezers, which are needed for the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna, Pfizer, and Astrozeneca, seem to be solid choices while we are in this COVID economy. UPS and FedEx also seem like the correct stocks for the logistics portion of the vaccine rollout. </p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Not financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
