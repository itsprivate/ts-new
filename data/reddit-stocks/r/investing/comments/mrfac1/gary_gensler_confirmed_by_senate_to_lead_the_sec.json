Both subjects received attention on Capitol Hill this year after January’s wild trading in Game Stop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Gensler also noted potential problems with the current structure of payment for order flow, a common practice on Wall Street whereby trading firms, such as Citadel Securities, pay companies to send them their customers’ orders for execution.</p>\n\n<p>Questioned in March how the SEC should regulate bitcoin and other digital assets, Gensler replied that the responsibility could fall across the government depending on how assets such as bitcoin are classified. One of his earliest and most-anticipated decisions as head of the SEC will be whether to allow the creation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-confirmed-to-lead-the-sec.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-confirmed-to-lead-the-sec.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Gary Gensler also taught the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn\">Blockchain and Money</a> course at MIT&#39;s Sloan School.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
