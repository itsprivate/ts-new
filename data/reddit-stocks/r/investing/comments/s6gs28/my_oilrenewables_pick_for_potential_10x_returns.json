I have seen several posts over the last week requesting tickers in this sector to start some DD on, so I thought I would do a very brief overview of my one stock pick that I believe will net investors significant gains over the next 2-3 months and a potential 10-15x over the next 2 years - $VTNR (Vertex Energy).\n\nDisclaimer: I own shares and LEAPs of VTNR.\n\n**Overview**\n\nVertex Energy is a refiner of alternative feedstocks and producer of motor oil netting the company roughly $150m in revenue yearly on average, but has struggled to convert much of this into profit in what is essentially a low-margin business – but this is not what investors are here for in VTNR.\n\nThe company announced a strategy change in May 2021 which sent the stock from $1.80 to highs of $14.32 (has now declined back to $5.12 following the decimation of all small caps over recent months – however, the stock has recently formed a base and started a strong uptrend). They are in the process of selling their legacy business of motor oil and recycling assets to Safety-Kleen systems for $140m – the sale is expected to close in the first half of 2022. Running alongside this is what investors are interested in - the purchase of a refinery in Mobile, Alabama from Shell for $75m which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n**Mobile Refinery**\n\nOnce the acquisition of the Mobile refinery closes, Vertex plan to convert the existing hydrocracker to produce renewable diesel by the end of 2022. The refinery has capacity of 91,000 barrels of oil per day, with Vertex expecting 14,000 of these barrels per day to be renewable diesel by mid-2023.\n\nVertex expect to spend an additional $85m on the conversion of the hydrocracker, and expect to be producing renewable diesel at the refinery by Q3 2022. They will also enter into a multi-year offtake agreement with Shell and others for the oil and diesel produced at the refinery.\n\nHere is what Vertex’s VP of business development had to say on the offtake agreements.\n\n\"As part of this transaction, we plan to enter into multi-year crude supply and product offtake  agreements with several highly-respected counterparties, including Shell, who has been an   exceptional partner throughout the sale process. We believe these agreements will position us  to reduce our working capital requirements, while mitigating spot market risk on product sales.  Upon closing, we expect to hedge a significant portion of the first-year production, reducing our  near-term exposure to movements in refined product margins, as we focus on completing the  planned asset conversion, which remains the most significant near-term economic driver   resulting from this transaction.\"\n\nThe share price dropped from its highs initially due to worries that Vertex would be unable to secure the funding required to buy the refinery and upgrade the hydrocracker. Those worries have been put to bed recently as Vertex have secured financing in the form of a combination of funds to be received from the sale of the legacy business along with convertible notes due 2027 and a credit facility. Investors should note that the convertible notes will likely be dilutive, though not in the short-term and I estimate maximum dilution around the 10% mark.\n\n**Financial Projections**\n\nIn their recent Q3 2021 earnings call, management set out full year 2022 and 2023 forecasts for the refinery.\n\nFY2022\n\n* Revenue: $2.5 billion\n* Gross profit: $240 million\n\nFY2023\n\n* Revenue: $3.5 billion\n* Gross profit: $470 million\n\nThese figures were based on oil at $72 per barrel, and oil is up over 15% since then, with Goldman analysts expecting oil to top $100 in 2022 and JP Morgan analysts seeing it go even higher to $125 ($125 unlikely IMO unless Russia invade Ukraine). To put into context why I think Vertex will see massive gains in 2022, the current market cap is only $324m (share price $5.12) at the time of writing, or less than 0.1x 2023E revenue. \n\n|Oil Price $|60|72|85|100|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2023E Earnings $|180|220|250|300|\n|Multiple|15|15|15|15|\n|Market Cap $|2.7B|3.3B|3.75B|4.5B|\n|Price per Share $|43|52|61|71|\n\n(Assumes earnings is equal to 50% of gross profit in line with Wainwright’s analyst report, ignored debt and potential dilution (not near term) from convertible notes (likely 5-10%) for ease of calculation, used P/E ratio of 15 – current oil &amp; gas refining average P/E is 37, oil &amp; gas production average P/E is 20 and oil &amp; gas midstream average P/E is 18 per finviz).\n\n**Short-Term Outlook**\n\nThe factor that could move the share price violently upwards over the immediate short-term is that a whopping 25% of the small 42m float is sold short with the closing of the purchase of the Mobile refinery expected within the next 2 and a half months.\n\nVertex will likely have their earnings update during the second week of February where I expect management to provide an update on the acquisition or to announce the deal has closed successfully, at which point I expect the stock to 2x or more. A double over the next few weeks would still put the stock at less than 0.2x 2023E revenue.\n\n**Risks**\n\nIf the refinery purchase falls through the stock likely falls into the $2-3 range. I find this highly unlikely (less than 5% chance); Vertex has been hiring for new positions at the Alabama refinery of the last week and they have already started with initial design and engineering work at the refinery, indicating to me that the deal close is imminent.\n\nAlso, there is certainly execution risk following the closing of the transaction, particularly relating to the upgrading of the hydrocracker. Personally, for swing traders who are interested in a quick swing focused on the closing of the refinery purchase and likely subsequent short squeeze, I see relatively little risk. For those seeking larger gains in the hopes that management can execute on their earnings forecasts, they are definitely subject to a lot more risk. Size accordingly.\n\nThis has been a very brief introduction to the company and if anyone wants to do some further DD, Vertex has released some very detailed updates on their strategy pivot here:\n\n[Strategy Update Presentation](https://www.vertexenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vertex-Energy-Strategy-Update-August-2021.pdf)\n\n[Q3 Earnings Update](https://www.vertexenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/VTNR-3Q21-Conference-Call-Deck.pdf)\n\n[10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/890447/000162828021022319/vtnr-20210930.htm)",
