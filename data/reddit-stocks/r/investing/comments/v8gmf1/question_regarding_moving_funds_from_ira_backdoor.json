I’ve been informed by my accountant and members of this community since I’ve already contributed to my 2022 SEP I should wait to roll it over. \n\nNow I also plan to roll my Trad IRA into a Roth IRA for plans for do the back door Roth contribution methods. \n\nMy question is should I wait to open/roll the Traditional IRA account into the Roth since I will have a SEP for the remainder of 2022 and do all this in 2023? I think I’ve read I can’t really do the back door method with a SeP and don’t want to cause issues for the 2022 tax year by doing this too early",
