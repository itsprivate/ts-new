Namely the T+35 FTD covering of a legacy options chain leading to short covering (not a squeeze) upon the ending of said options chain.\n\nPart 1) What we know:\n\nWhen an American company merges with a foreign company, Shorts have to close out FTDs on the merged company T+35 days after a merged company’s legacy option chain ends.\n\nCase-In-Point New Egg and Lianluo LTD:\nOn October 25 2020 when news broke about  the Lianluo Retahd LTD merger with NEWEGG, the stock went from 0.4$ to 4$ the next day, meaning the news caused shorts to start covering. $NEGG then hovered between $4-10 until May 19. T+35 days after the Lianluo options chain ended however, from June 29 to July 7 shorts covered a veritable fuck ton of Lianluo short positions, causing the price to run up as high as $79 intraday.\n\nPresent Day Example:  Metamaterials and Torchlight energy merged in June but the TORCH options chain only closes on Jan 21, 2022, so expect short covering FTDs T+35 days after that date and similar price movement to Newegg in March.\n\nProposed Investing Strategy: Buying promising companies that undergo reverse mergers with foreign companies on the month of Final Options Expiry of the merged company.\n\nPart 2) Potential exacerbation of FTD delivery obligations via exercising or the XXX1 Options \n\nNutshell Thesis:\n\nBuying and exercising XXX1 forces FTD delivery and compounds the effect, resulting in a gamma squeeze:\n\nPast:\nWhen Lianluo LTD (LITT) merged with NEGG, two options chains emerged for a brief time: NEGG1 and NEGG, exercising NEGG1 would give you LITT taken from the NEGG float. Reducing the float would increase the price of NEGG. Basic Supply and Demand. Had this been done en masse a “gamma squeeze”would likely have occurred on top of the mandatory T+35 FTD Delivery of LITT.\n\nPresent:\nComing to the merger of Torchlight Energy (TRCH) with foreign Canadian company Metamaterials (MMAT), the options chain for TRCH ends on Jan 21, 2022. I believe that this presents underlying systemic risk to market makers who are naked shorting the stock if my hypothesis is correct.\n\nReal TRCH shares are tied to MMAT1…. Forcing delivery of FTDs is only a good thing because it would cause appreciation of the MMAT1 options which will cause a gamma squeeze (hypothetically)\n\nBuying options = Bad\nBuying and exercising = Good\n\nBasically my argument is:\n\nWouldn’t buying and exercising MMAT1 force delivery of a finite number of TRCH shares via MMAT, which essentially would reduce the MMAT float and drive up price?\n\nHow to obtain MMAT1:\n\nOn Fidelity:\n\nThere are 2 sets for Oct and Jan, in the adjacent for both there are some that have multiple lines for same strike. The top one for each double is the mmat1... this is confirmed by clicking get quote and it shows up top. Mmat1.\n\nFidelity instructions below courtesy of u/bigdeerjr \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MMAT/comments/rhezvj/having_trouble_finding_mmat1_options_here_is_a/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nOn TD:\n\nHave to call the trading desk. They want to make sure you understand it is an adjusted option. Jan is available.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GQeiyVP\n\n————-————-\nPart 3 (optional): Underlying Mechanics\n\nThe Science Behind a Gamma Squeeze:\n\nWhen a trader buys a call option, it creates a risk for the counterparty who sold the call option. Without further measures, if the shares rise above the strike price, the option seller will have to acquire those shares in the open market, at a loss, to fulfill the contract. \n\nThere are many ways to hedge this risk. The net-net of the process, though, often requires someone to buy a share of the underlying stock, called a covered call.\n\nPositive feedback loop (aka what happened to Gamestonk): As the stock goes up, the market maker will adjust its hedge by buying more stock. Meaning if you BUY AND EXERCISE cheap OTM CALL options, market makers have to buy real shares to keep the option hedged.\n\nThe Escape: Hedgefunds can escape the gamma squeeze -aka rampant OTM call buying- by buying long term OTM PUTS\n\nThe Exception: This DOES NOT work if the Option Chain ITSELF IS GOING TO DIE. Rampant OTM Call buying and exercising cannot be stopped if the options chain of a company is about to expire if it undergoes a merger. In fact, all FTDs of a PRE-merged company are due T+35 days after final Options Expiry.\n\nWe will explore the hypothetical possibility of compounding an FTD due date and a gamma squeeze —aka BUYING and EXERCISING MMAT1 Options—.\n\n—————\nPart 3\n\nThe Trade - How and why BUYING and EXERCISING MMAT1 Options could force a Gamma Squeeze of MMAT\n\nPOINT 3: Egghead Math\n\nEXERCISING Jan 21 MMAT1 Options, purchasable through Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, could theoretically cause a gamma squeeze by forcing call writers to hedge risk, credit to u/tonys_357 for example below:\n\nWARNING: EGGHEAD MATH BELOW\n\n“I see that there is a Jan 21, 2022 MMAT option with a $2.5 strike price, which, if it were exercised, results in 50 shares of MMAT + 100 shares MMTLP.  This option is (of course IN-THE-MONEY).\n\nI see that there are currently (12/13/2021) 3,078 open interest in these calls.\n\nIf all the open interest were exercised, the call writers would have to buy 153,900 MMAT, and 307,800 MMTLP.\n\nThe ASK on this option is $1.00, with a multiplier of 100, the cost of the option is $100.\n\nTo exercise, it costs 50 x 2.5 = $125.\n\nSo, the total cost to buy and exercise is : $100 + $125 = $225.\n\nThis returns 50 MMAT (which is currently at $3.09), and also 100 MMTLP.\n\nThe 50 MMAT x $3.09 = $154.50 value.\n\nThat means the cost of the MMTLP is :\n\nTotal Cost - $154 = $225 - $154.50 = $70.50 for 100 MMTLP shares.\n\nThat works out to $0.705 / MMTLP share.\n\nSince the current price of MMTLP is $1.43, that is a savings of $0.725 / of MMTLP or greater than 50% savings.\n\nSo, it possible that people might buy these $2.5 MMAT options which expire on Jan 21,2022, due to cost savings (when exercising - and receiving shares).\n\nThat, in-turn, could result in the call-writers buying MMAT, and MMTLP to offset their risk.\n\nWhich might result in a gamma-squeeze.” (u/tonys_357)\n\nMATH ENDS ^\n\nTLDR: \nIn January, stock ticker MMAT is facing four major catalysts that could cause a short squeeze:\n\n1. MMAX converting to MMAT, cutting the float in half from 218 million to 109 million\n2. An Oilco Special Dividend that could cause an OSTK style squeeze\n3. Jan 21 2022 TRCH Options Expiry forcing SHFs to deliver TRCH FTDs T+35 days later in March\n4. Investors Buying and Exercising MMAT1 Options through TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, exacerbating the effects of Point 3.\n\nI wrote this as a point of academic curiosity. I absolutely DO NOT want people to do this. Rather I’m interested to see if my hypothesis is correct.\n\nHave an awesome day",
