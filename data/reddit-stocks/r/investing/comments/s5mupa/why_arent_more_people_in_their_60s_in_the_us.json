Are more people living paycheck to paycheck than I realize? Are people just really not that good at saving much?\n\n\n**EDIT:** here are some more conservative numbers. If you start at age 30 (rather than 25) and save 5k per year, with a fairly conservative estimate of 5% returns per year which arguably accounts for a few % of inflation each year, you'd have 350k by age 60 and 634k by age 70, which according to the calculator linked above is a lot closer to the median percentile (60-70 percentile in this case)",
