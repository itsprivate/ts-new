Previously, China had restricted wheat imports from Russia due to concerns about the presence of dwarf bunt fungus — a disease that can cause severe loss of yield for wheat and other crops — in some parts of the country.\n\nChina has refused to condemn Russia's attack on Ukraine, instead repeating calls for parties to \"exercise restraint\" and accusing the United States of \"fueling fire\" in the region",
