This means that as the attractiveness of bonds grows due to higher yields and investors m can begin to shift from gold into bonds.</p>\n\n<p>As inflation expectations rise, profitability will continue to rise, which means more people will choose this strategy.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen the opinion that for this reason gold will &quot;forever&quot; remain below $ 1700.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the obvious exaggeration about &quot;forever&quot;, then there is logic in these arguments. But there are nuances, and not even one.</p>\n\n<p>- This reasoning could, in principle, be applicable if gold and bonds were competing for one fixed budget, and the question would be only in allocation. This is definitely not the case even without the participation of the Central Banks, and they are pouring more and more new money here.</p>\n\n<p>- Even more important is the very reason why profitability is growing, and it was already mentioned above, is the growth of inflationary expectations. A rise in prices means an increase in the nominal value of &quot;real assets&quot;, to which gold belongs. And in an inflationary world, the argument about the absence of a coupon income, which is expressed in terms of currency losing value, is inapplicable. Here, protection against the destruction of this value is more important, and gold provides such protection, albeit with reservations.</p>\n\n<p>Those who claim that all this was already in the past, and now the role of gold, they say, is played by the crypto, I think, will soon understand how wrong they were. <em>The world&#39;s regulators have not yet had their say. But they can. And will.</em></p>\n\n<p>As for inflation itself, two scenarios can be roughly distinguished here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Inflation is increasing, but it remains under control.</strong> Then monetary policy does not change significantly, rates stabilize and even fall, thanks to the Fed. Everything returns to what it was in the 2nd half of 2020, that is, both bonds and gold are growing moderately.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Inflation is rising sharply and the current order is being disrupted.</strong> The rest depends on the scale of inflation, and even more on inflationary expectations.</p>\n\n<p>In a mild form, this will repeat the scenario of the 2000s before the crisis - rates are gradually increasing, gold is growing even faster (in the 2000s, more than three times before the crisis).</p>\n\n<p>In a tougher version, refinancing gigantic debts, including sovereign ones, becomes impossible, the bond market tends to collapse, forcing the Fed to buy everything. Gold in this case can go to the stratosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Output? In our opinion, the current weakness in gold is temporary and not directly related to inflationary expectations.</p>\n\n<p>These can be purely trading strategies, for example, buying gold with borrowed money at a rate tied to bond yields.</p>\n\n<p>Now such trading is unprofitable, and positions are closed, in favor of this can be evidenced by a sharp drop in speculative longs for gold - almost twice from the end of December to the level of spring 2019, when gold was trading below $ 1300. Inflationary trading, in fact, has not yet begun, and it is definitely positive for gold.</p>\n\n<p>I am convinced that many will disagree with me. There are quite a few ifs &amp; buts in all of this. I express my cautious point of view. God forbid, I do not pretend to be the ultimate truth.</p>\n\n<p>However, I hold shares of producers of precious metals in my portfolios. As well as I still hold the Bitcoin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
