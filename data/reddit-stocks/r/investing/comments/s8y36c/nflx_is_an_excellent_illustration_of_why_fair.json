For one, Netflix was already in decline since November from a high of $700 per share.  \n\nJust days ago, Netflix also interestingly hiked their subscription fees, and FP&amp;A usually does their pricing exercise just before the fiscal year starts... if prices are hiked, it can be an indicator that finance expects lower customer acquisition than previously forecast.  And, as it turns out, Netflix adjusted its forecast for Q1 2022 to 2.5 million net new subscribers, much lower than analyst expectations of 5.9 million. But, there's more...\n\nForget for a moment any prognostications about the pandemic and how Netflix isn't keeping pace with emerging SVOD competitors who have a stronger brand identity.  The fact of the matter is that Netflix is in a class of securities that were, prior to today's news and even afterward, hugely overpriced.\n\nMorningstar equity research puts Netflix's fair value at $275 per share.  The stock was, at yesterday's close, trading therefore at an 88% premium to fair value.  When market conditions change, the companies that tend to have the steepest declines are those whose fair value is known to institutional investors to be substantively below the current market price.  Companies trading closer to fair value, or at a discount to fair value, tend to decline the least.\n\nAs an investor and finance data analyst of 25 years, I can say with fairly high confidence you're going to continue to see examples of this in the coming months not merely because of Netflix-like scenarios where the pandemic provided an initial boost to subscribers but the company failed to keep up with competitors, but also because rising interest rates will have the most deleterious impact on companies whose growth is very dependent on debt and/or issuance of new equity, because rising interest rates will both increase interest expense, depress equities  markets and consequently require higher rates of return on borrowed capital and equity to generate the same net ROIC, and therefore increase the cost of capital overall, which determines the discount rate applied to future cash flows in Discounted Cash Flow analysis.",
