That&#39;s a 60% potential gain at a PT of $27.</p>\n\n<p>This stock ran to $23 in November off a $26 pt from Credit Suisse.

Citigroup Inc. 3% Minimum Coupon Principal Protected Based Upon Russell initiated coverage on shares of Fisker in a research note on Wednesday, November 25th. They set a “buy” rating and a $26.00 price target on the stock. Smith Barney Citigroup began coverage on shares of Fisker in a research note on Wednesday, November 25th.

No. But the Morgan Stanley valuation alone is a big enough hype to raise the price well above $20 in the short term according to my research.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: $FSR 3 contracts $18.5c 3/5</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
