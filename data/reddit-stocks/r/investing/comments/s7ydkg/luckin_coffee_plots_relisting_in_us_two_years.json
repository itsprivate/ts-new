  "selftext": "Luckin Coffee is exploring plans to relist its shares in the US, nearly two years after an accounting scandal in which the Chinese coffee chain fabricated more than $300m of sales, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nOnce touted as the biggest challenger to Starbucks’ dominance in China, Luckin was delisted from the Nasdaq exchange in June 2020 and six months later agreed to pay $180m to settle accounting fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which claimed it had raised more than $864m from investors during the time of the falsified accounts.\n\nAccording to two people with knowledge of discussions among the company’s senior management, Luckin is exploring whether to relist on Nasdaq, possibly as soon as the end of this year.\n\nLuckin has held meetings with investors and advisers ahead of the proposed relisting, as well as to discuss other options for capital raising, according to the people. They said new management and recent growth at the coffee company could prove an attractive turnround prospect for investors.\n\nA relisting would be likely to face fewer regulatory obstacles than a Chinese company pursuing an initial public offering in the US because its shares are still traded there and it has continued to file earnings reports, according to one of the people close to the situation.\n\nLuckin filed for bankruptcy in the US in 2021 to allow it to restructure its debts while its coffee shops remained open. It could move ahead with the relisting plan once it concluded the bankruptcy process, one of the people said.\n\nThe fraud revelations were first published in early 2020 by short seller Muddy Waters, which accused the chain of having an “inherently flawed” business model and inflating sales.\n\nBut Luckin has since expanded in China. In December, it reported that third-quarter revenues had grown 106 per cent year on year to Rmb2,350.2m ($370m). It has 5,671 stores, the majority of which are on the Chinese mainland — about 500 more outlets than its closest rival, Starbucks.\n\nShares in Luckin have continued to trade over-the-counter in the US since it was delisted, giving the company a market valuation of about $2.5bn.\n\n“We are seeing strong performance across the business . . . with increased customer retention and order frequency [and] greater brand recognition,” said Jinyi Guo, chair and chief executive of Luckin, in its latest earnings report.\n\nSome longtime critics of the company continue to express scepticism, however. “Revenues rising sharply is something that those of us who have been following Luckin have seen before,” said Michael Norris, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, who wrote a series of articles questioning the pace of the company’s expansion ahead of its IPO in 2019.\n\nLuckin has restructured a large chunk of its debt, paid down a big portion of its SEC fine and appointed new auditors, according to company filings.\n\n“They are doing financially and operationally very well . . . none of the allegations related to the quality of their coffee,” said one of the people close to Luckin.\n\n“It’s an attractive asset because it has been doing so well in the consumer market,” the person said.\n\nShares that were previously controlled by Charles Lu, the co-founder and former chair who was voted out by shareholders in July 2020, totalling about 17 per cent of the company, are expected to be sold in the coming days, according to one person close to the matter.\n\nLuckin declined to comment.\n\nThe group appointed Hong Kong accounting firm Centurion ZD CPA as its auditor last April after its previous auditor, New York-based Marcum Bernstein &amp; Pinchuk, resigned from the role stating it had “not gathered sufficient independent third-party data or conducted sufficient audit procedures to complete the audit”. EY, which audited Luckin in the run-up to its IPO, was replaced after the scandal.\n\nSource: https://www.ft.com/content/f8327af5-5203-44fd-acc7-267c7b475fa7",
