Furthermore, real interest rates, which are interest rates that take inflation into account, are among the lowest they've been in 50 years. They were lower only in the mid-70s and early-80s.

In the event of continued or above trend inflation, investor's will feel a need to find a store of value. Large institutional investors have a duty to preserve their clients' investments. They will buy anything that holds value, even if it doesn't rise much. Gold could be a logical pick because it is somewhat easy to buy and has a long track record.\n\nCould gold still be that store of value?",
