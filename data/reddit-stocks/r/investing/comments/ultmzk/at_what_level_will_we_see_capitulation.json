There’s no data to prove this but I’m going to guess the Fed obviously has a desire to lower their balance sheet, and pre-pandemic levels could potentially be a good target. Meaning they have to unroll about $5 trillion, which at current rates would take about 50 months.\n\nthere is nothing that states all stock market price discovery should break over this. There’s nothing to say that companies will not make and grow earnings.\n\nHowever, we’re obviously going through what seems like a correction. The joke around this sub has always been, if too many people are buying we’re at the top, and when people start making posts like this, we should be closer to the bottom.\n\nall jokes aside since I’m not really interested in calling bottoms or timing or anything like that, I’m just curious where a “sane” level of “downtrend” makes sense.\n\ndo we revert to the mean of 15x P/E? i’m not exactly sure what price that puts us at. I will do the math later. that would be with trailing 12 month earnings, and if 20% of the companies in the S&amp;P (random number) fail to grow or even start to go backwards earnings wise, the valuation projection quickly becomes useless.\n\nthis form really hates to say numbers. They love by the dip. I love by the dip. I see how time in the market works. I’m not trying to time any markets.\n\njust trying to have a conversation on what some eye opening numbers would be if you were to see them flash across your screen from a bottom prescriptive.\n\n3800? 3500? 3300? 3000?
