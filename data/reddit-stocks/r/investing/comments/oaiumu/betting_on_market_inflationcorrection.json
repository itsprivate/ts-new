  "selftext": "Hi everyone I've been recently interested in all the inflation talk and treasury yield rates as the economy recovers from last year. I'm interested in learning more about bonds, inflation, the Fed etc. I want to make a play on $TTT ( an inverse (-3x) of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index). Essentially I'd like your help with these three scenarios, is my logic incorrect or am I missing some other important factors- or both.\n\nScenario 1: Inflation (currently around 5%, near 2008 high) continues to pick up in the following months. Does the Fed raise interest rates to combat this? I believe Powell has stated they don't want hikes until 2023. So in my mind higher inflation---->demand for higher yields as investors don't want their money eroded by inflation. In this case I would be bullish on TTT (?)\n\nScenario 2: Lets assume there is a big selloff/correction in the general market in the following months, for any reason (i.e. overleverage). I'm assuming that investors would be interested in parking their money in safer treasuries/bonds, which would drive the yield down for these securities? In this case I would be bearish on TTT (?)\n\nScenario 3: Inflation tapers off in the following months, the economy is showing a decent recovery, no major financial events occur. I'm guessing yield rates remain the same or edge slightly upwards towards the end of the year. So this is a more neutral stance on TTT, slightly bullish (?)\n\nI do realize that TTT is not meant for long term plays typically, I'm more interested in getting the market dynamics down of these possible futures down. I mostly used it as a real life example I could visualize. Feel free to comment using 1,2, and 3 for direct responses to my thought process.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nBonus: How do these scenarios affect overnight repo rates, which are currently around 800B .",
