Interestingly, they offer 7.4%/yr for participating with a few stablecoins, meaning the value of the coins does not change and you make a \"guaranteed\" 7.4%/yr.\n\nThe fine print states the the loan is not secured; borrowers post no collateral. So, if I participate, I understand that the coins I loan out may never be returned. This brings several questions to mind and I'd love to hear some thoughts:\n\n1) Is there any way to assess the level of risk here? How can we possibly determine if this is a good investment? With bonds, there is some calculable measure of risk via credit ratings, but this program seems 100% opaque beyond vague promises that borrowers are heavily vetted.\n\n2) Given that these loans are all aggregated and packaged on the Gemini side, to the point where we can withdraw our \"loaned\" assets at any time, How would Gemini distribute the losses if a borrower defaults on repayment?\n\n3) Other thoughts?",
