I know all investing is kind of like gambling but with stocks there's some tangible thing you get. Most stocks pay out dividends and in theory if a stock is undervalued then some very rich people will buy the stock because they want a partial ownership of the company itself which creates a scarcity that drives up prices. So there's something tangible there (ownership plus dividends) but with crypto I'm confused. What do you get? I hear people invest in it cause it's the \"future currency of the world\" but then wouldn't it be a bad investment because for a currency to function I'd have to stop all its volatility and become mostly stagnant like the us dollar. I also hear that people invest in it cause they are investing in the block chain technology but bitcoin isn't a company and they don't have any patents so how is it investing in the block chain? Is crypto just a pyramid scheme/gambling ring or am I missing something. Is it a worthy investment for someone a bit more risk adverse?",
