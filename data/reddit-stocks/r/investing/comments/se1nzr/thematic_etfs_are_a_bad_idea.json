Disruptive Technology was also considered a safe bet for outperforming the market and many people posted portfolios with ARKK, down more than 50%. I also remember similar trends with 3D printing and Cannabis and I’m sure there are many more good examples in the past. \n\nThe new big thing is semiconductors.

What people miss though is that the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and it has crashed multiple times before. \n\nSOXX is down 15% YTD which is only slightly more than the Nasdaq-100 to be fair. However, multiple companies in this sector have just released their quarterly numbers and the projections for the upcoming year are underwhelming. On top of that, the amount of investments to increase supply are staggering with intel spending 20 billion on a new factory and TSMC also building up supply significantly.\n\nI can’t tell if SOXX will really underperform going forward but I want to warn people who think it’s a safe bet. \n\nTLDR: Thematic ETFs are made by marketing to sell higher fees and that’s about it.

In [this](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3765063) paper from 2021, it was estimated that specialized ETFs underperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis and after fees by 3,1% per year. The title ”Competition for Attention in the ETF Space“ undermines my point that these product are probably created based on marketing.",
