Meta’s Novi pilot—a money-transfer service using the company’s own cryptocurrency digital wallet—will end on Sept. 1, the service said on its website, a link to which it texted to its users. Both the Novi app and Novi on WhatsApp will no longer be available, the company said on the Website. Starting July 21, users will no longer be able to add money to their accounts, Novi said, advising users to withdraw their balance “as soon as possible.” Users won’t be able to access their transaction history or other data after the pilot ends. The company does plan to use Novi’s technology in future products, such as in its metaverse project, a company spokesperson said in an email. “We are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,” Meta said in the statement. “You can expect to see more from us in the web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.”\n\nThe stock has been cut by more than half in 2022. Although Wall Street has been in a buying mood last week, real world pressures continue to make META stock one to avoid. Alternatively, if investors can’t help but like META stock at current prices, I’d similarly point to a long vertical spread using call contracts or a fully hedged collar for those interested in owning shares. But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.\n\nMeta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels’ inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta’s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
