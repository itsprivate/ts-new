Would this inference be correct? If yes, does this somehow pose a problem for Apple&#39;s business in future?  </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that since Apple outsources all of its production not just to another country but also to another company, this is what is leading to a very low book value.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
