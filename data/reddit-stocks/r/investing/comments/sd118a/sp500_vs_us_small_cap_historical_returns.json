What I found out from these 70 years of returns was that although the S&amp;P500 is an incredible investment long term, investing specifically in US Small Cap stocks would yield over double the returns over the same time period. \n\nSomeone please tell me if I'm incorrect because I'm still new to all this, but assuming that is correct, would it not be ideal to focus on small cap US stocks? Obviously the big drawback is the increased volatility of small caps (S&amp;P500 has been winning out in the recent short-term), but with a longer time horizon I feel like this is the way to go to optimize returns. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
