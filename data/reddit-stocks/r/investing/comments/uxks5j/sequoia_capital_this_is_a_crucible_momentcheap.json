If you can't track down their most recent deck or it's stuck behind a paywall, they raise the following:\n\n- This is a \"Crucible Moment\", adapt to the changing environment and invest equipped with information, don't regret investments \n\n- This will be a longer recovery. Can't say how long, but the tools to help a recovery have all been exhausted.\n\n- There is no cheap capital anymore. But smart companies will borrow or do equity raises even if on unfavorable terms to survive.\n\n- Related to the above, we don't have a liquidity crisis, but expect liquidity to be tight going forward.\n\n- Capital was free for a couple years. Now capital is expensive. We are only now seeing the impact of how the increasing cost of money impacts the real economy.\n\n- At a high level, the market isn't as challenged as it was in 2001 or 2008, but you need to look beyond the megacaps to get the full picture.\n\n- Growth at all costs is no longer being rewarded. The market is shifting to reward profitability. Investors are now focusing on near-term certainty. EV/revenue multiples and growth-adjusted multiples have all dropped dramatically. \n\n- The only way to stop inflation is to stop purchasing and shrink the economy.\n\n- They don't say it in so many words, but they expect smart companies to have layoffs to become \"nimble\".\n\nA/N: Sequoia is obviously more concerned with startups, but they are speaking to the broader market. But it matches the sentiment I am hearing in ventures - expect investment to cool significantly and valuations to plummet. Strategic investors with cash will likely ramp up M&amp;A activity in the short term as they see opportunities to acquire or acqui-hire on the \"cheap\" compared to the last few years.",
