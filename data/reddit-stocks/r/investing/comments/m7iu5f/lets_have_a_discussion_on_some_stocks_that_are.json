And the margin of error has to be low.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the tickers I think that should go here.</p>\n\n<p>WMT(Walmart): A trillion dollar company in the making.</p>\n\n<p>AMD(AMD): They are eating INTC&#39;s lunch and also to some extent are also eating NVDA&#39;s lunch. Huge growth ahead.</p>\n\n<p>BRK.B(Berkahire Hathway): When Warren buys his stock, you know it’s undervalued.</p>\n\n<p>BABA(Alibaba): While some might disagree sighting China danger, I think it’s overblown. And when people tend to fear something too much, that&#39;s when they undervalue things.</p>\n\n<p>STMP(Stamps.com): An underrated gem which seems like too good to be true for its lowly valuation. I have tried to find some good reasons why this was so blindingly undervalued. I couldn’t find anything reasonable to allow for such a huge discounted valuation.</p>\n\n<p>TYO:7974(Nintendo): The best IP company to own for the upcoming gaming decades. At least 40% undervalued according to my base case estimates(using conservative figues).</p>\n\n<p>GOLD(Barrick Gold): This one is a little more dependent on the assumption that gold won&#39;t tank any more. If it doesn’t, I don&#39;t know why you wouldn’t want to own this one.</p>\n\n<p>PFE(Pfizer): I don&#39;t know how this could be in such a valuation despite their good pipeline and numerous ventures.</p>\n\n<p>ULVR.L(Unilever): This one is also dependent on the assumption that GBP doesn’t rise any higher. If it doesn’t, you can thank me later.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s some of the tickers that I think of. What are some of the tickers that you can think of and why?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
