For the broader Russell 2000 index, there have been more insider buyers than sellers this month for the first time since March 2020, VerityData said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite retail investors pulling out of the stock market and the looming threat of a slowdown or recession, “corporate insiders are holding a non-consensus view across most sectors and \\[are\\] actively buying the dip”, analysts at JPMorgan said in a May 27 note, adding that the share purchases were encouraging for the direction of stock markets.\n\n[Line chart: Net insider buying](https://archive.ph/Xoram/8b7ad801524416a019e2e59407135fd8bb58963c.avif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUS stocks snapped a seven week losing streak on Friday although the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is down 12.8 per cent so far this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStrong insider buying “has historically been a pretty good sign of market bottoms”, said David Giroux, portfolio manager at T Rowe Price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Insiders are saying ‘we don’t see a massive event coming’ . . . \\[that\\] these are really good buying opportunities,” he added. “This is just another confirming data point that should be positive for the market over six to 12 months if not longer.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarlier this month Howard Schultz bought $15mn of Starbucks shares after returning as interim chief executive in March to the company he turned into a global coffee chain. It was the first insider stock buying at Starbucks since August 2018, VerityData said. Starbucks shares are down about 35 per cent so far this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVladimir Shmunis, co-founder and chief executive of RingCentral, a web-based app company that replaces landline phones, spent $1.2mn on his first stock purchase since the company went public in 2013. RingCentral has seen its share price plunge more than 60 per cent this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRepresentatives from Starbucks and RingCentral did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“There is certainly message sending \\[with\\] buying and some of it is performative,” said Ben Silverman, research director at VerityData.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, Silverman said that he would have expected “more intense buying right now”, especially at S&amp;P 500 companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“In March 2020, no one had any clue how the next two years would play out,” he said, adding that at the start of the pandemic “we saw a lot more \\[buying\\] conviction”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n@Via [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/72442478-1759-4ac2-8d7c-bf0382997af9) (non-paywall link at [archive](https://archive.ph/Xoram))",
