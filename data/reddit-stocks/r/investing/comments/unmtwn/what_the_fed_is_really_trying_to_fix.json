This balance sheet includes $2.7 trillion in mortgage backed securities (MBS). There are proposals to sell $30 billion in US treasuries and $20 billion in MBS per month.\n\nThe official narrative to this massive tightening of fiscal policy this year is to quell inflation. For context, Jan CPI was 7.5%, Feb was 7.9%, March was 8.5%, and today’s print for April came in at 8.3%. These are historically high inflation rates.\n\nBut I suspect the Federal Reserve isn’t actually targeting inflation. They are much more worried about something else.\n\nThis is why.\n\nInflation is a function of supply and demand. The Fed with their fiscal policy has decent but also blunt control over demand. It doesn’t have as much control over supply. Especially in this macroenvironment where supply is constricted by a war and pandemic lockdowns halfway across the world. Interest rate hikes and balance sheet runoff will not bring peace to Ukraine, nor will it slow spread of COVID in Shanghai.\n\nIn addition, we already see aggregate demand in a really bad spot, with GDP showing a rare 1.4% decline last quarter. Demand is pretty dead. Peloton is down 92.5%. People aren’t in the mood of buying.\n\nSo if the demand is already low, and Fed can’t control supply chain issues, how do they fix inflation with interest rate hikes and balance sheet sell off?\n\nAnswer is they can’t. CPI inflation is not what they care about.\n\nRather, the Fed is super worried about the housing market. We already see that the housing market price trends are significantly higher than the past decade’s upwards trend and I reckon the Fed is really worried about any sort of deleveraging in the housing market. Since about 26% of household wealth is tied to mortgages, if we start seeing foreclosures, significant household wealth will just vanish which will be deadly for the US economy.\n\nAlthough cooling the housing market means pulling back the stock market, it’s a lesser evil since stocks are not usually purchased on leverage, while houses are typically always bought with leverage by majority of US pop.\n\nInterest rate hikes and MBS sell off might not have much impact on inflation in this macroenvironment but they directly pare back home prices, and that’s where we think the Fed is targeting.",
