Instead, in rollover years traditional 401k contents are rolled to the traditional IRA, and Roth 401k contents are rolled to the Roth IRA. \n\n* Modeling a glide path, and differential returns after retirement when the focus shifts to retaining wealth and generating stable income, is best done currently by manually adjusting settings on individual years",
