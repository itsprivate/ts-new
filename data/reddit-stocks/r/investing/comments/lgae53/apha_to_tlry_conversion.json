My question is... will we see the prices of APHA and TLRY naturally come close to this .8381 conversion rate closer to the deal? Currently .8381 of TLRY would come out to $35.49, and APHA is trading at $23.45.</p>\n\n<p>Will we likely see some natural or manipulated movement close to this price ratio, either in APHA rising or TLRY falling? Seems like this can’t just be a free money glitch, no? If anyone has experience with similar deals in the past insight would be appreciated!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
