There has been 7 stock market crashes since 1950, averaging one every 10 years. </p>\n\n<p>The stock market crashes ranges from inflation (10%+), to oil price rises (4x) due to war, dot com bubble, housing market collapse, covid-19 etc.</p>\n\n<p>The graph is a log graph meaning that the space changes are proportional to the percentage change. This is useful for looking at long term charts since the % change for a dollar increase is smaller as the index value goes up.</p>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 has averaged a compound annual growth rate of 8.22% since 1950. This is illustrated by the trend lines, and as you can see the S&amp;P 500 is trading right in the middle of the range (the two blue trend lines). </p>\n\n<p>I noted a few reasons in the box for each crash for a brief understanding of why it had happened. Note, that the only one with a &#39;fear of overvaluation&#39; was only the dotcom crash where the PE&#39;s were over 200 and many companies were just cash burning shells with massive negative free cash flows.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying a crash / correction won&#39;t happen, but i just wanted to put things into perspective and give a bigger picture of the overall stock market since pretty much before all of us were born. </p>\n\n<p>By no means am i an economist but I didn&#39;t include anything earlier than 1950s because that was pre WW2/WW1 - before the US was a superpower / the global financial hub / USD = world trade currency etc.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: some of you noted that its only 8.22% if you bought at the start but I want to clarify that yes and no! Yes for the people that literally buy in once once at the beginning of 1950.</p>\n\n<p>No because if you buy throughout the years (DCA every month let&#39;s say) you&#39;ll buy within the range - both lower and higher range! So it&#39;s more or less 8%! For example during 1960s-1980s the sp500 traded sideways! So if you constantly bought in those 20 years, the accumulation of money in this period would have a higher CAGR of &gt; 8% because of where it is in the range. Just follow the lines! It makes it easier. There&#39;s roughly same amount of periods above and below the middle trend line.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
