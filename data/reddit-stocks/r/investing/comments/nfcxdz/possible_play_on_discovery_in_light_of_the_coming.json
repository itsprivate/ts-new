  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Deal Structure:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The deal will be carried out in the form of the Reverse Morris Trust, which implies spinning off WarnerMedia into a separate company, let&#39;s call it NewCo (no official name yet), which will then merge with Discovery. As a result of the transaction, the share of the current AT&amp;T shareholders in the new company will be 71%, and 29% of NewCo will be held by the current shareholders of Discovery. AT&amp;T will receive $ 43 billion from the NewCo in return for the transfer of media assets (WarnerMedia) to NewCo. The structure of the transaction (Reverse Morris Trust) will eliminate the need for AT&amp;T to pay income tax on the transfer of assets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Debt:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The new company will own WarnerMedia, Discovery&#39;s current business, but it will immediately have $ 58 billion in debt ($ 43 billion from AT&amp;T and $ 15 billion from Discovery). WarnerMedia and Discovery&#39;s combined EBITDA in 2020 was $ 12 billion (expected to grow to $ 14 billion by 2023). I would like to point out a negative point right away. At the close of the deal, the leverage of the new company will be 4.83x. However, the company plans to cut it to 3x by 2023. High leverage of NewCo, as well as uncertainty about NewCo&#39;s valuation, caused a correction in Discovery shares on this news. Management also expects operating synergies of $ 3 billion per year from the merger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Revenue and FCF:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Discovery&#39;s revenue for 2020 is $ 10.4 billion, WarnerMedia&#39;s revenue was $ 30.4 billion. Total revenue for 2020 for the two companies is $ 40.8 billion. The new WarnerMedia &amp; Discovery entity is projected to produce roughly $8.4 billion in free cash flow if you follow the free cash flow conversion guidance given in the announcement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Valuation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you do the math, taking the share ownership of 71% AT&amp;T holders and 29% Discovery holders and base the valuation of the new entity on the $43 billion price for Discovery&#39;s 29%, you get a total value for the new entity of roughly $105 billion or 12.5 times projected free cash flow of $8.4 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s take multipliers for the entire media sector. The sector average EV / S multiplier is 4.38, excluding Netflix, the multiplier is 3.31. Netflix has the highest multiplier in this sector (8.6), which affects the calculation of the average multiplier in our sample. I take the EV / S multiple since the spread in the EV / EBITDA multiple is even more significant. Accordingly, 3.31 will be the lower bound of our estimate, and 4.38 will be the upper bound. The Enterprise Value range will then be from $ 135 to $ 179 billion. The market value of the new company will be equal to EV minus debt, that is, $ 77- $ 121 billion. The fair value of the Discovery share is $ 22.3-35 billion. vs current $16-18B (depends on the series DISCA/DISCK/DISCB), a 25-45% upside.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What analyst say:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BofA estimates the combination is worth about $148B in enterprise value; correspondingly, it&#39;s staying Neutral on DISCA with a price target of $40 (now 22% upside from current price).</li>\n<li>Deutsche Bank calls the deal a &quot;clear positive&quot; for Discovery, and says it helps AT&amp;T get back to core distribution. From Discovery&#39;s perspective, this is &quot;the deal we hoped they could get done&quot; and it should be highly effective in driving DTC subscriber and revenue growth at home and abroad.</li>\n<li>Bank of America estimates the new Discovery/WarnerMedia entity to be worth approximately $148 billion enterprise value. This attributes a 13.5x multiple to 2030E direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) discounted back and a 7.0x multiple on CY22E legacy OIBDA. When applying Discovery&#39;s 29% stake, this equates to an implied Discovery share price range of $39-42/share.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Share classes:</strong></p>\n\n<p>As for Discovery share classes, the spread is narrowing (between nonvoting DISCK to DISCA, to 7% from 15%). So now that the arbitrage is over DISCA should be going up along with DISCK. Not sure how DISCK will move - better avoid it as it&#39;s x2 of DISCA/DISCK and once the vote passes it may collapse...</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a DISCA holder</p>\n\n<p>PS.
