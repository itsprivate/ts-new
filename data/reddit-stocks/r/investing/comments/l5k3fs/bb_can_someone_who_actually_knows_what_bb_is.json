If one time and majority of 175 mn vehicles being non-connected, they don&#39;t mean much for direct future revenues.</li>\n<li>BB IVY is still under development and expected to start deploying in 2023 that at net revenue (post AWS share) of $10-11. So meaningful revenues are likely to start in 2025 and there is a huge execution risk between now and 2023.</li>\n<li>How to go about valuing BB, is price to sales good measure?
