They reveal, for the first time, how a $90m-a-year lobbying and public relations effort recruited friendly politicians to help in its campaign to disrupt Europe's taxi industry.\n\nWhile French taxi drivers staged sometimes violent protests in the streets against Uber, Mr Macron - now president - was on first name terms with Uber's controversial boss Travis Kalanick, and told him he would reform laws in the firm's favour.\n\nUber's ruthless business methods were widely known, but for the first time the files give a unique inside view of the lengths it went to in achieving its goals.\n\nThey show how ex-EU digital commissioner Neelie Kroes, one of Brussels' top officials, was in talks to join Uber before her term ended - and then secretly lobbied for the firm, in potential breach of EU ethics rules.\n\nAt the time, Uber was not just one of the world's fastest-growing companies - it was one of the most controversial, dogged by court cases, allegations of sexual harassment, and data breach scandals.\n\nEventually shareholders had enough, and Travis Kalanick was forced out in 2017.\n\nUber says his replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, was \"tasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates\" and has \"installed the rigorous controls and compliance necessary to operate as a public company\".",
