The idea behind this is that the money is \"save\" in the market due to companies in general profiting from increasing prices and therefor increasing in value. \n\nI do not comprehend how this would work, for the following reasons:\n\n1. As long as the stockmarket value does not increase as much as inflation, you still lose value. \n2. As long as salaries do not incease as much as inflation (which currently does not seem the case), this would cause consumers to lose buying power. Anything consumer related thus would start making less profits and drop in value. Any money invested in related stocks would thus lose to inflation and to the stock dropping in value.\n\nPutting your money in indexes/funds might thus work countereffective as you are hit by inflation and the stock market dropping/being stagnant due to consequences of inflation. Looking at the inflationary period from the 1965-83, the S&amp;P was more or less stagnant over this timeframe. You would thus mainly have lost money to &gt;5% y/y inflation in that period in the market (I am not sure how much stocks have paid dividends in those times, that might have compensated for this). Market growth only continued after 1983 (after the insane rate hikes put trough by the FED, putting inflation down). Based on this it, seems that buying the general market is not a good strategy if inflation rages. \n\nI could not really find individual stock prices of companies that might have performed well in 70/80s (if anyone has a source, I am interested). However, judging from commoditiy prices in the timeframe of 1965 to 1985, oil, gold, iron etc (so basically commodities) would have been great investments over that timeframe. \n\nDo you guys think picking investments (e.g. commodities/related stocks) might allow you to outrun inflation, are you sticking with a general market DCA strategy or do you have another strategy?",
