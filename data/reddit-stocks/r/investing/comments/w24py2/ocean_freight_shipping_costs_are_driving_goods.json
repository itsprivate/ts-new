The carriers are blaming the importers (using the port as extra storage space since their warehouses are full) and trucking companies (shortage of drivers).  The marine ports themselves are partly to blame (e.g. containers can only be picked up or returned by appointment and a container can only be returned if they pick up another due to lack of space).  The containers can't be picked up until all fees are paid and after any customs inspections.  Congress approved a bill to give the Federal Maritime Commission more power over the shipping industry, and the commission has handed out some fines, but they're small compared to the industry's profits.\n\nIt seems like a real big mess but how accurate is the article?  Are the carriers mostly at fault here or is it everybody?  There's been a bunch of posts over the past year regarding the outlook of ocean freight and trucking equities but obviously fuel costs and HR shortages are factors.  It's hard to tell who is fighting for survival and who is having an opportunistic feeding frenzy.",
