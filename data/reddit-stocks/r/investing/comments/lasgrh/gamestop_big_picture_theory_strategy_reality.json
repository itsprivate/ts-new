This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I&#39;m using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.</em></p>\n\n<p>Before I get into Monday&#39;s action, a couple of things:</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to first give a shout out to <a href=\"/u/piddlesthethug\">/u/piddlesthethug</a> for capturing <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu\">this screenshot</a>, which shows that moment in time I referenced in my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/\">third Gamestop post</a>, where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.</p>\n\n<p>People have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I&#39;ve mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I&#39;d have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.</p>\n\n<p>Alright, so, today&#39;s action.</p>\n\n<p>I have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.</p>\n\n<p>I tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won&#39;t always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I&#39;ve said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don&#39;t just take my word for it just because I&#39;m the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I&#39;m mistaken, and don&#39;t dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn&#39;t help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn&#39;t much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>There was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.</p>\n\n<p>I got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples&#39; money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I&#39;m likely striking a healthy balance (lol).</p>\n\n<h1>The Game (Theory)</h1>\n\n<p>Ok, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?</p>\n\n<p>Possibly.</p>\n\n<p>I say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it&#39;s just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?</p>\n\n<p>In simplified terms, I&#39;d describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction\">dollar auction</a> where the winning side also takes the losing side&#39;s bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it&#39;s winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.</p>\n\n<h1>Power</h1>\n\n<p>For most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that &#39;information is power&#39; and the closely related &#39;knowledge is power&#39; are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be &#39;money is power&#39;, or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.</p>\n\n<p>Today, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>Being in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality\">siege mentality</a> at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it&#39;s critical for your long-term financial success.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I&#39;ve tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.</p>\n\n<h1>Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk</h1>\n\n<p>Many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.</p>\n\n<p>Some people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be &#39;responsible&#39; investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else&#39;s hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I&#39;ve been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.</p>\n\n<p>Others trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.</p>\n\n<p>Others are momentum traders and &#39;technical analysts&#39;, who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man&#39;s land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.</p>\n\n<h1>Swimming In The Deep</h1>\n\n<p>So, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don&#39;t know, and no one else does either.</p>\n\n<p>One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver&#39;s seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.</p>\n\n<p>Another question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.</p>\n\n<p>All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I&#39;m writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.</p>\n\n<p>If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don&#39;t know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.</p>\n\n<p>Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.</p>\n\n<p>If the squeeze fails to happen there won&#39;t be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever&#39;s still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn&#39;t the case, but if it is I&#39;ll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.</p>\n\n<p>If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don&#39;t forget to ring the register!</p>\n\n<p>Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it&#39;s definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.</p>\n\n<p>Apologies for the lengthy post again.  Good luck in the market!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
