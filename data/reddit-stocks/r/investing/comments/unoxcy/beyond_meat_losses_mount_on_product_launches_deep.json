Co, which are spending heavily to cater to the craze for plant-based meat, forcing Beyond Meat to offer deep discounts on its products.\n\n[https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/beyond-meat-misses-quarterly-sales-estimates-2822952](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/beyond-meat-misses-quarterly-sales-estimates-2822952)",
