I usually dollar cost average throughout the year, but with the recent drop i decided to go all in earlier in the year. My primary concern is with my 401k, my employer matches 5% and gifts 3%, but since I am close to my max I am worried i won't be able to get that match since I will need to stop contributing. Looking at my options inside the 401k, i see traditional, Roth, and after-tax. On the after tax option it says you can continue contributing after your limit and the benefit is you can withdraw these contributions \"tax free and penalty free\", but then says \"when you withdraw money you are taxed on a pro-rata portion of earnings at the tax bracket rate when you withdraw\". These two statements confuse me. What i want to know is how this works and it's tax implications and whether my company will continue the 5% &amp; 3% match even if I choose this option? My IRA and HSA are basically maxed and the only other option i see is a regular brokerage account. But is there a benefit to using this after tax 401k vs a brokerage account?",
