Well the fact that there is a shortage, literally means that there is a supply issue. They can’t keep up with the demand. \n\nAs a result, semiconductor stocks must be booming right? Right, but now that so many investors have come to the same conclusion, they rush to these semiconductor stocks, pumping the price up. Good for everyone who owns shares.\n\nNow here comes the issue- whenever a company grows, their P/E ratio naturally grows as well as it is directly tied to the company’s earnings. If the P/E ratio of a stock goes up, the earnings need to follow or else it doesn’t warrant for the additional price growth.\n\nNow here is where we bring the discussion back to the problem at hand- chip shortage.\n\nWith there being a shortage of chips, semiconductor companies are unable to keep up with the demand, essentially bottlenecking the companies earnings growth. You can’t keep growing and producing more revenue if you can’t produce inventory fast enough to keep up with the demand, meaning the companies earnings won’t be able to grow at the same rate as the share price, proving those price levels to be unsustainable, resulting in a drop in share price.\n\nTHIS IS MY OPINION/THEORY, FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION BELOW\n\ntldr; chip shortage means semiconductors can’t produce enough chips for the current demand, meaning their revenue can’t grow to sustain the growth of the share price- post  your thoughts\n\nEdit:\n\nA company can grow for years, although if their P/E ratios are blown out of proportion, the share price may be stagnant, or even drop for that matter, simply due to the fact that it just couldn’t grow fast enough. If a company is priced at a p/e of 40, that means an investor is willing to wait 40 years to make back his initial investment if earnings are to stay the same. If the stock doubles and the P/E ratio is 80, well, guess what that means. Either way, there is no way companies that are already priced at these levels can just consistently grow their earnings at a 30-40% rate for even 3 years in a row. They would take over the world. Not to mention that if they decide to grow by raising their prices, that will raise the prices on the rest of the supply chain that utilizes the chips (lol, everything). What does that contribute to? Inflation.\n\nTLDR; think about every time a stock beats earnings and seems to be flat or even drop. That’s due to a high P/E ratio, meaning it didn’t grow at the rate it needed to support those price levels",
