And it’s going to keep on raising them till something breaks, says John Stepek. The **“Fed put”** is dead. Or at least, the stock market level at which the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, will intervene with the soothing balm of looser monetary policy, has been lowered substantially. That much is very very clear. If anyone had any doubts, yesterday’s monetary policy decision should have set them right. The Federal Reserve isn’t playing games anymore. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point. It’s now targeting a Federal Funds rate of 1.5-1.75%. When you think about how unthinkable that would have been just a year ago, it’s staggering. Most investors were quaking at the notion of a quarter point rate rise.  ",
