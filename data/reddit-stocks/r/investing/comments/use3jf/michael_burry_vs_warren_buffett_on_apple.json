Berkshire has been loading up on Apple shares while famous short seller Michel Burry has taken up a short position. I think this is pretty interesting since AAPL, like so many other tech stocks, has seen a drop from ATHs to hold and waver around $145 (I've been commenting about my expectations it would hit this price for a while now).\n\nCertainly, both have had bets go wrong and have lost money on positions. I do wonder if there are some implications about this positioning though. Given that Berkshire tends to have a bit longer time horizon than Burry, maybe there's an implication that we might see some fluctuation downwards before a recovery later? There's also the consideration that [AAPL has been a \"hedge fund hotel\" in the past](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-bullish-chanos-explains-how-its-the-hedge-fund-hotel-1441814793), so it may simply be a choice to make use of their cash.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/69a0120e-bb28-3f90-b874-48402642d732/warren-buffett-stocks-.html\n\n&gt;Berkshire Hathaway turned into an active buyer of stocks during last quarter's volatility, especially in the quarter's final six weeks, after a long stretch of muted purchases.\n\n...\n\n&gt;The conglomerate added 3.8 million shares of top holding Apple (AAPL) during the tech stock's Q1 sell-off, taking its total Apple shares held to 890.9 million. It gathered roughly 50 million more shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) as well.\n\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/michael-big-short-burry-shorts-apple\n\n&gt;Infamous investor Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" has bet against Apple ( (AAPL) - Get Apple Inc. Report), according to a SEC filing.\n\n&gt;During the first quarter, Burry, a hedge fund investor who is known for predicting and profiting from the housing bubble and subprime mortgage crisis by betting against collaterized debt obligations or CDOs during the mid 2000s, stocked up on Alphabet ( (GOOGL) - Get Alphabet Inc. Class A Report), Meta  Platforms (FB), and Discovery ( (DISCA) - Get Discovery, Inc. Class A Report) for Scion Asset Management.\n\n&gt;The hedge fund owned bearish put options against 206,000 Apple shares as of March 31. While the Macbook and iPhone manufacturer's stock price has nearly quadrupled since 2019, Apple's stock has fallen by 16% this quarter alone and 11.8% during the past month.\n\n\nDisclosure: AAPL shareholder (in addition to many other tech companies; if you think I might be biased somehow by share holdings you should probably just assume I hold some).",
