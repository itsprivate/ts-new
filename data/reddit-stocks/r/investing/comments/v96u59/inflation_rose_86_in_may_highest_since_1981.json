Excluding volatile food and energy  prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9%  estimate.\n\nOn a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared to respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.\n\nSurging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.\n\nEnergy  prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to  34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain,  pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.\n\nShelter costs, which account  for about a one-third weighting on the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month,  the fastest one-month gain since March 2004. The 5.5% 12-month gain is  the most since February 1991.\n\nFinally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.\n\nThose  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month.  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though  average hourly earnings rose 0.3%. On a 12-month basis, real average  hourly earnings were down 3%.\n\nMarkets reacted negatively to the  report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall  Street and government bond yields rising.\n\nSome of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%).\n\nFriday’s numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.\n\nThe  inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a  rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May’s report  likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest  rate increases ahead.\n\n“Obviously, nothing is good in this report,”  said Julian Bridgen, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic  research firm. “There is nothing in there that’s going to give the Fed  any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.”\n\nWith  75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets  widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and  possibly into 2023. The central bank’s benchmark short-term borrowing  rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to  2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.\n\nInflation has been a political headache for the White House and President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).\n\nAdministration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to [the Covid pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/), imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services, and [the Russian attack on Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).\n\nIn  a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further  improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the  budget deficit.\n\nHowever, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering  inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that  the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.\n\nHow  much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper  with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go  further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current  inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears  because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now.",
