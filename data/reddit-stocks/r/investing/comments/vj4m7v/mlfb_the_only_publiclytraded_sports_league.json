That could help raise more funds through a second term sheet, making it seem like this league could happen soon.\n\n## TLDR; \n\n* The MLFB is an ambitious plan looking to fill a gap in the sports and entertainment markets\n* If the league ends up proving successful by adding value to fans, teams, and players during the off-season, it may set itself up for big potential partnerships (such as the NFL) and solid profits in the long run\n* While going public and making the ownership of a league available to any investor is interesting, I'm not too fond of the process in which the company did so\n* As an investor, value is vital, and in this case – debt financing does not equal to value\n* Due to the natural state of the project, I’d mark it as a risky asset with extremely high volatility as an investment– nevertheless, its latest announced funding could be the catalyst for more funding and a first pilot season\n\n*Source – Originally posted on the* [Sports-Tech Biz Magazine](https://www.sportstechbiz.com/)",
