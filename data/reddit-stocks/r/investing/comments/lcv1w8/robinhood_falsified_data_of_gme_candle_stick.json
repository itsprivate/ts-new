To begin this off, the first thing that was weird was RH asking me to press an accept button in order to use their advance graph tool. Weird but ok.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the day, I noticed that the GME advance chart on RH would often just break and needed a page reload. It was weird to me because I had multiple graphs up but it consistently was only the RH GME advance chart that kept on failing and also kept on kicking me out of RH. So I looked into it.</p>\n\n<p>The data RH is showing has been transformed from the original data. To make it even worse, the data transformations are located within the page source</p>\n\n<p>Raw data graph added of O,H,L,C versus time by source:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/zEYELmB\"><del>https://imgur.com/a/zEYELmB</del></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/x2VwSPY\"><del>https://imgur.com/a/x2VwSPY</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: Had to fix the AM to the PM</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/oYFJQTi\">https://imgur.com/a/oYFJQTi</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: need to slow down to format my AM and PMs properly</p>\n\n<p>Overlay pictures of candel stick graphs:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/9wC60Jr\">https://imgur.com/a/9wC60Jr</a></p>\n\n<p>The data transformations in the page source of the RH advance chart of GME:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/8ETG5O0\">https://imgur.com/a/8ETG5O0</a></p>\n\n<p>I pumped this thing out as fast as I could without getting into further details.</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr: RH is getting so desperate as to lying to us to our face now.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: As of 6:07 PM MST, RH decided to change their page source to hide this</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/e7jyRJk\">https://imgur.com/a/e7jyRJk</a></p>\n\n<p>Update: I sent a complaint to the SEC. I definitely have the page source code saved and uploaded to many different clouds. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
