Russia was pumping about 10 million barrels of crude per day, and exporting about half of that, before it invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"The implications of a potential loss of Russian oil exports to global markets cannot be understated,\" the IEA said in its monthly report. The crisis could bring lasting changes to energy markets, it added.\n\nThe IEA, which monitors energy market trends for the world's richest nations, said that refiners are now scrambling to find alternative supply sources. They could be forced to reduce their activity just as global consumers are hit with higher gasoline prices.\n\nSo far, there's little sign of relief. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the only producers with significant spare capacity. Both countries are part of the 23-member OPEC+ coalition, which also includes Russia. OPEC+ has been increasing its collective output by a modest 400,000 barrels per day in recent months, but often fails to meet its own targets.\n\n\"The long-running inability of the bloc to meet its agreed quotas, mostly due to technical issues and other capacity constraints, has already led to sharp draws in global inventories,\" the IEA said. If major producers do not change course and open the taps wider, global markets will be under supplied in the second and third quarters of 2022, the agency warned.",
