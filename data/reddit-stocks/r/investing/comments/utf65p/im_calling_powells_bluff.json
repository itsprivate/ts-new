I also believe we will have a minor recession at worst. Putting this here to refer back to and see if I was on the money.\n\n# \n\n# &gt; What Will Play Out This Year\n\nThe Fed is  jawboning markets down to cool inflation without having to actually jack interest rates up. This is because they can't for an extended period of time. The US government has too much debt to afford large repayments. Furthermore it will become difficult to complete treasury auctions when the fed is selling not buying.\n\n**The Fed doesn't want to kill stocks**, Powell loves the stock market.\n\nIn practicality his purpose is to keep debt borrowing costs as low as possible for the US government. This Fed has constantly erred on the side of accommodative, they cut rates in 2019 when there was barely an excuse. They will jump on any excuse to drop rates and print print print. The only time they cannot is when inflation is so out of control it's pissing people off. They're not different people now, they just are talking different.\n\n**Powell faces 4 dragons right now:**\n\n1. Post-covid supply bottlenecks,\n2. Elevated food/energy from Ukraine war\n3. Supply bottlenecks from China lockdown\n4. The inflationary echoes of the covid printing bender and stimulus\n\nNotice something?\n\nAll 4 of those will resolve by themselves at some point. While we're not going to wind back the past inflation, we are on trajectory for it to come down. Last month on month reading was .3% or 3.7% annualized. Considering current events not bad. Many leading indicators I use are rolling over.\n\nInflation will remain elevated for a couple years because the Fed is half heartedly tightening with negative real yields and minor balance sheet reduction. But in order for inflation to keep going up, prices have to keep going up from their current elevated levels. In the near future the 4 dragons will begin to die and this will only help.\n\n**Therefore later this year I expect a softening from the Fed** after a few good inflation prints. This will cause a rally in stocks, not breaking all time highs but higher then now. It doesn't mean we're going back to the 20/21 era, the fed will not be going crazy like that again for a long time. But it's going to look a lot rosier then now.\n\nThis means **depression fears are also overblown**, the problem is valuation like the dot.com crash, not a liquidity crunch like 2008. We still have an extra $5t floating around on the feds balance sheet and negative real rates. Borrowing at 4% while inflation's at 9% is a good deal. We may have a technical recession given difficult short term economic events, but it will be mild and short lived.\n\n# \n\n# &gt; How To Make Money\n\n**Big money is sitting in cash**, the money isn't gone and the cost of borrowing money is still below inflation - making margin loan expansion likely. This means at the first sign of clear skies later this year we're going to get a big rally as liquidity rushes back in.\n\nAs predicted **Hypergrowth is oversold** and there's quality names trading at attractive prices. This is the worst time to buy inflation or recession hedges as they're already overbought. Trade the cascade as sectors collapse one by one, buy what has collapsed, don't sit in what will collapse. Don't overpay.\n\nAs outlined in a past update, developed nations have no choice but to devalue their currency through persistently elevated inflation. Emerging markets really don't have our inflation problems for the most part since they didn't print. So **EM is about to have an era of outperformance** in stocks and bonds as it enjoys a greater share of global consumption.\n\nCalculating for inflation, real GDP growth and additional cash on the Fed balance sheet the **fair value for the S&amp;P 500 is around 3800**. Anything below that is a steal considering I doubt we're going to have a major economic collapse.\n\nIn bear markets correlations become 1. Meaning everything falls in unison by sector, regardless of which companies are actual stand outs. There's too much going on for accurate pricing. When investors panic every bad event that could happen is more then priced in. I always try and buy on panic. **Incredible mispricing's are being created right now, buy them**.\n\nSo in short BUY GROWTH STOCKS. The good ones. \n\n# \n\n# &gt; What Stocks I'm Buying\n\n* **Shopify ($SHOP)** \\- Anything below $300 is a steal. Look at what it will be not what it is now.\n* **Sartorius ($SRT.DE**)\n* **JinkoSolar ($JKS)** \\- Will double on a China rally. Not a huge fan of China so don't hold forever.\n* **Austal** ($ASB.AX)\n* **Emerging Market Local Currency Bond ETF** (**$EMLC)**\n* **India ETF ($INDA)**\n* **Indonesia ETF ($IDX)**",
