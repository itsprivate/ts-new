  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>made a similar DD around 8.50 earlier this year, and its only been getting more bullish as the year goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, there&#39;s a few main takeaways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>New CEO is phenominal.  Car industry his whole life.  He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises.  This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now.  They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing.  I expect strong 2021 outlook.</p></li>\n<li><p>The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue.  Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands.  For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150.  They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands.  This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.</p></li>\n<li><p>They have 2 other extremely promising aspects.  First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans.  Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area.  The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal.  Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.  </p></li>\n<li><p>The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason.  Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good.  Most have looked into it, some have bought it.  They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them.  They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rivian.  The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars.  Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion.  They made several billion on that investment alone.</p></li>\n<li><p>One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control.  They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons.  As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical.  People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar.  This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Other side notes: Bronco will be massive and already doing well.  Yes, theyre less concerned with revenue so its dropping, but still, doubling profits but less revenue is fine.  New administration will likely invest heavily in Ford for EV&#39;s and even wrote a letter encouraging it to the prez.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
