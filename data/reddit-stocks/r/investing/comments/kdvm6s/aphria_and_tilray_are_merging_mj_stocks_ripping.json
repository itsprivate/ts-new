Aphria is likely to emerge with a majority of the combined company’s board seats and with its shareholders owning a 60 per cent stake, although that could change, added one of the sources who has direct knowledge of the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy is said to be in line to occupy a seat on the board of directors, but is unlikely to retain an executive position, that source added. \nNegotiations between the two companies were ongoing as of Tuesday and there&#39;s no guarantee that a deal will be completed. \nRepresentatives from Tilray and Aphria were not immediately available for comment. “</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
