It can be thought of as a fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful.\n\nAIEA is discussed here:  [https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), and the raw data is available here:  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis).\n\nI did a comparative analyses between ECY and AIEA, and agree that AIEA has superior predictive power. That analysis is available here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TkVbfd32b\\_SE6J8D7DuXFTJhOfBn4lOWEIZjTp\\_u-\\_w/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TkVbfd32b_SE6J8D7DuXFTJhOfBn4lOWEIZjTp_u-_w/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIn the top row of charts, AIEA verse future nominal 10-year return is shown. This has an astounding R\\^2 of 0.871, which means that 87.1% of the data is explained by this indicator. It is a bit lower than Jesse Livermore found, because of a different time window.\n\nI use this line to get an expected 10-year nominal yield for each AIEA and subtract from this the 10-year nominal bond yield at that time to get an Excess AIEA Yield. This represents how much stocks are expected to beat bonds by for at a given time. I show this in the second row of charts, plotted in real dollars. The R\\^2 has dropped a bit, to 0.768. This is lower, but still very good. Primarily, what this tells us is that AIEA does not predict the effect of inflation.\n\nIn the next row, I show an apples to apples comparison to Shiller's ECY, which has non-linear fit, and a lower still R\\^2 value of 0.473.\n\nI then repeated my back testing for the new parameter, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. AIEA related columns are shown in green, while CAPE related columns are in red. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable than bonds if Excess AIEA Yield from 6 months ago > 1.4%.\n\nIf I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.99% from 1952 to 2021 for Excess AIEA Yield, compared to 7.63% for Shiller ECY, and 7.34% for stocks alone.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n* In January, Excess AIEA Yield was -0.91%, which is significantly less than 1.4% so this indicator says that now is the time to switch to bonds (or deleverage). This contrast with Excess CAPE Yield, which still indicates about 1% of wiggle room before switching to bonds.\n* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored. If by waiting for some months to a year, you can save significantly on taxes, do so. These indicators do not move quickly and you can afford to be patient.\n\n**Warnings**\n\n* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.\n* AIEA measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.\n* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.\n* The data for the new parameter only goes back to 1945, and is low quality till 1952, while the Shiller data can be calculated back to 1881. This means you have to pick whether you'd like better correlation and higher back test results or more data in deciding what to do.\n\nFinally, it will only take bond yields popping by 1% to bring these two indicators into agreement. I expect that to happen within a year. I also expect the market to peak within a year. These two assumptions are connected.",
