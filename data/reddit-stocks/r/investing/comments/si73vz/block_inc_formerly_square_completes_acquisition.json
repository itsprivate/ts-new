(NYSE: SQ) and Afterpay Limited today announced the successful completion of the Scheme of Arrangement under which Block has acquired all of the issued shares in Afterpay. This transaction aims to enable Block to better deliver compelling financial products and services that expand access to more consumers and help drive incremental revenue for sellers of all sizes.\n\n“We’re excited to welcome the Afterpay team to Block and are eager to get to work,” said Jack Dorsey, Block co-founder and CEO. “Together, we’ll deliver even better products and services for sellers and consumers while staying true to our shared purpose of making the financial system more fair and accessible to everyone.”\n\nThe acquisition furthers Block’s strategic priorities for its existing Square and Cash App ecosystems. Together, Square and Afterpay intend to enable sellers of all sizes to offer 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover sellers and BNPL offers directly within the app.\n\nToday, Square also launched its first integration with Afterpay, providing Afterpay’s BNPL functionality to sellers in the United States and Australia that use Square Online for e-commerce. This new omnichannel commerce tool can help sellers attract new shoppers and drive incremental revenue from day one. For more information on this announcement, read the press release here.\n\nAfterpay co-founders and co-CEOs Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen have joined Block and will help lead Afterpay’s respective seller and consumer businesses, as part of Block’s Square and Cash App ecosystems.\n\nBlock will release financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 on February 24, 2022, after the market closes.",
