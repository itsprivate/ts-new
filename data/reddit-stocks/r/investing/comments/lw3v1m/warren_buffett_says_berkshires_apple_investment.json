When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple,” wrote the veteran investor.</p>\n\n<p>The cost for acquiring that stake was $36 billion and since then Berkshire has enjoyed regular dividends averaging about $775 million annually and has pocketed an extra $11 billion in 2020 by selling a small part of its holdings.</p>\n\n<p>The continuous repurchase of shares by Apple and the consequent shrinking number of shares outstanding has meant that Berkshire now owns 5.4% of the Tim Cook-led company. “That increase was costless to us,” wrote Buffett.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Berkshire’s third-quarter operating profits declined 32% to $5.48 billion from $8.07 billion a year ago. The company <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/11/18260772/berkshire-hathaway-reports-q3-earnings-record-9-3b-stock-buyback?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\">repurchased .3 billion worth of stock</a> in the period.</p>\n\n<p>Since Berkshire also repurchased its own shares during the past two and a half years, its shareholders now own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than they did in July 2018, wrote Buffett.</p>\n\n<p>“This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future,” revealed the Oracle of Omaha.</p>\n\n<p>Buffett also pointed to Apple’s publicly stated intention to repurchase shares and thus Berkshire shareholders would find “their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.”</p>\n\n<p>This year the Buffet-led company <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/21/02/19694882/warren-buffetts-berkshire-cuts-apple-stake-and-buys-these-drugmaker-telecom-stocks-instead?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\">cut its position in Apple</a> by 6% to 887 million shares in the latest quarter but upped stakes in <strong>AbbVie Inc</strong> (NYSE: <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ABBV\">ABBV</a>), <strong>Bristol-Myers Squibb Company</strong> (NYSE: <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BMY\">BMY</a>), and <strong>Merck &amp; Co</strong>, Inc (NYSE: <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MRK\">MRK</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Apple still remains the single largest investment in Berkshire’s portfolio.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> Berkshire Class A shares closed nearly 0.9% lower at $364,580 on Friday. On the same day, the company’s Class B shares closed 1.3% lower at $240.51. Apple shares closed almost 0.2% higher at $121.26 and fell 0.41% in the after-hours session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shivdeep Dhaliwal</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mon, March 1, 2021, 1:28 AM·2 min read</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
