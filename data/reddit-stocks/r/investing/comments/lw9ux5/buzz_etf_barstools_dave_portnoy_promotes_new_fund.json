The algorithm is based off of stocks with the most “buzz” and conversation on social media (not sure exactly which platforms) that also meet the criteria of being a large-cap stock. </p>\n\n<p>Dave Portnoy’s involvement, despite his controversies, ultimately leads to more buzz for $BUZZ itself, thanks to $PENN, DDTG, and his many public appearances on CNBC, CNN, Fox News, etc. He may be used mainly as a promotion tool.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
