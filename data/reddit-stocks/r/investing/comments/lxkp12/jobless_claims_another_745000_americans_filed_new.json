Here were the main metrics included in the report, compared to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Initial jobless claims, week ended February 27: 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week</p></li>\n<li><p>Continuing claims, week ended February 20: 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Initial jobless claims edged up only slightly after sinking far more than expected during the week ended February 20, though at least some of that drop appeared to have stemmed from data collection issues due to the extreme winter weather blanketing the country mid-month. Still, the stabilization below 750,000 suggested some underlying improvements in unemployment trends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-jobless-claims-week-ended-february-27-183810049.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-jobless-claims-week-ended-february-27-183810049.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
