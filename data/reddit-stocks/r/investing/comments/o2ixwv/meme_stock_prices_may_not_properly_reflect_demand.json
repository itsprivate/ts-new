The wholesalers match the orders internally, trying to profit off of the bid-ask spread, while offering retail traders the best market price or better.</p>\n\n<p>Retail brokers say payment for order flow lowers overall costs for individual traders.</p>\n\n<p>But the practice raises conflict of interest questions and will be included in a broad review of stock market rules, Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said last week.</p>\n\n<p>The review will also examine whether off-exchange trading - which is about 50% of the market when institutional block trades are included - distorts the price discovery mechanism for stocks, Gensler said.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
