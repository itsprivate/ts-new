The regulation also allows mainland-incorporated firms to directly list overseas without the need for a VIE if they meet the requirements. The draft was published online to solicit public opinion through January 23.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The regulator said it would only assess the truthfulness, accuracy and completeness of submitted documents before giving applicants a green light for offshore listings, indicating that the registration-based system is not a stricter approval process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The draft rule contradicts a [December 1 report from Bloomberg](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3158198/chinese-securities-regulator-discussions-over-vies-hong?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article) that said China planned to ban initial public offerings on foreign exchanges through VIEs to address concerns about data security. It added that fundraising through VIEs would still be allowed in Hong Kong. \n\n \n\n&gt;The CSRC said that the rule is not retroactive, so companies already listed as VIEs overseas are exempt from the stricter rules. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Under the new rule, Beijing will strengthen oversight of companies’ operations, including the handling of data, before allowing them to list overseas.",
