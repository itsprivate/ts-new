I personally found it very insightful and thought this community would as well. I&#39;ve looked deeper into those comments and this is what I&#39;ve found.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>FTFT plans on liquidating its shares</p></li>\n<li><p>FTFT is financially unstable</p></li>\n<li><p>FTFT shows signs of fraudulence</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2><strong>FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders</strong></h2>\n\n<p>What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.</p>\n\n<p>Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd (<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html\">source</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html\">source</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Purchase of Spondula (<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html\">source</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT&#39;s common stock</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The list goes on. If they could, they&#39;d buy their coffee using common shares.</p>\n\n<p>They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering (<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html\">source</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering (<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html\">source</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering (<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html\">source</a>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And the most frightening one...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2/26/21: 240 million share dilution</strong> (<a href=\"https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&amp;RcvdDate=2/26/2021&amp;CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&amp;FormType=DEF%2014C&amp;View=html\">source</a>): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone&#39;s share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can&#39;t find where the other 20% comes from.</p>\n\n<p>This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there&#39;s a date associated with it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about <strong>March 18, 2021</strong>, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don&#39;t. But they can whenever they want.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2><strong>FTFT is financially unstable</strong></h2>\n\n<p>First off, isn&#39;t is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What&#39;s probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006\">source for all referenced lawsuits</a>).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I&#39;m just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Luwei ($3 million in shares)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm\">source</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>FTFT shows signs of fraudulence</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by <strong>1000%</strong> (<a href=\"https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf\">source</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) (<a href=\"https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf\">source</a>). It&#39;s even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yu, lasted 3 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.</p>\n\n<p>On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wang lasted 7 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.</p>\n\n<p>On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Simon &amp; Edward LLP lasted 1 month</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon &amp; Edward, LLP (“Simon &amp; Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.</p>\n\n<p>On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon &amp; Edward, LLP (“Simon &amp; Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BF Borgers, the current accountant (we&#39;ll see how long they last)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let&#39;s look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) (<a href=\"https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0\">source</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll let the report speak for itself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.</p>\n\n<p>So, while the strangeness in FTFT&#39;s auditing doesn&#39;t prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2><strong>In Conclusion...</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2><strong>The Risks:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The scariest -- I am wrong:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I&#39;m an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I am right, but the stock price goes up:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn&#39;t matter:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.</p>\n\n<p>Happy trading.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
