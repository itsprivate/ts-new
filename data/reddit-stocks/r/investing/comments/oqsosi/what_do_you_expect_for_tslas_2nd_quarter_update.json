  "selftext": "This sub has been very quiet about discussing Tesla lately it seems. Just getting a status update on what everyone thinks may happen this quarter and in the future.\n\nJust to throw some possibilities around, here are some discussion points. \n\nWhat do you expect this quarter? Will it be enough to push Tesla back above $700?\n\nWill having Bitcoin on the balance sheet have an effect on their quarter? It's dropped some but not that much. It will be  slightly negative this quarter, but could bounce back again if Bitcoin runs again.\n\nHow do you think the stock will react if Tesla rolls out Full self driving that can drive people to work? The new subscription model is out, so FSDAAS is now an option, how does that effect their revenue next quarter and long term? How soon do you think FSD rolls out to wide release? It's already looking very impressive, but still needs some fine tuning. Will it be v10 or v11 that is capable? Is the processor enough to handle level 4 driving? What will be needed for level 5 FSD? \n\nHow soon will the Austin and Berlin plants open up to production? Are they duplicating problem solving of the 4680 Model Y line between Texas and Germany? Who is farther along? Is Berlin almost ready to go and just delayed by permit processes? Will the new factories be covered in solar panels?\n\nWhat is the going forward plans for letting other auto manufacturers use the Tesla charging network? Elon just mentioned Tesla will allow other EV's to use their network. Will all new chargers be pass through with 300kwh charging? That will be needed for the cybertruck. How big will their charging network need to grow, and how will that effect their revenue? Will they charge more for other manufacturers? How do they set that up? I assume it will be a Tesla adapter you buy that connects to your phone app.\n\nWill Tesla start manufacturing the semi soon? Do they have enough 4680 cells? Which location will be producing 4680 cells next, and is the final process completed?  \n\nWhat is the status on the updated cybertruck, and when will it be updated to show any other features? The 8 ton press has not arrived in Texas yet for the cybertruck castings. How far along are the designs for production? \n\nWhat grid scale battery projects are they working on now?\n\nWhat is delaying the S right now? It's hit pause on deliveries at the moment. Was the plaid fire a cause for concern on the battery? Will the steering yoke affect sales that much?\n\nAny further updates on the Model 2 and what's the plan for release on a $25k Tesla? How soon will it be debuted and when will it be released?\n\nWhat's the plans for AI day? Elon said this month, but will we get an update? How far along is DoJo? Will it speed up training for machine learning? Will it allow for processing far bigger datasets for self-driving? Where is it going to be located? Will Tesla release FSD before DoJo is online?\n\nHow is the chip shortage affecting production? It seems like most Tesla vehicles are sold out through the entire quarter already at all sites. \n\nWhat is the options market like for Tesla right now?\n\nWhat else do you expect from Tesla and where do you see them later this decade? Can other manufacturers keep up with their battery innovation? The bolt is being recalled for major issues, the Taycan was recalled for firmware updates, Volkswagen is having major software issues, Rivian and Lucid are delayed on deliveries. Will competitors overtake Tesla in EV production this decade?\n\nMade a couple edits to the post adding a couple other points and fixed grammar and spelling.",
