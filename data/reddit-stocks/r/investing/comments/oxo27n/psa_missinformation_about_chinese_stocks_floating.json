They are also directly owning some of the chinese parts of ALIBABA. The CCP only restricts foreign investments into certain sectors. In all other sectors foreigners can and do have direct ownership rights. There are three categories of sectors. Sectors in which foreign investers can invest freely. Sectors in which foreign investors can hold no more then 50% of total equity. And sectors in which foreign investors can not hold any equity.\n\nOnly a part of Alibaba is not directly or indirectly owned by Alibaba Holdings. For this part they have the VIE contracts.
