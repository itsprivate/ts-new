The Company has designed an end-to-end, flexible technology platform that delivers world-class performance and a low total cost of ownership to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end customers. Proterra has three complementary businesses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proterra Powered</strong>: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;</li>\n<li><strong>Proterra Transit:</strong> Leading North America as the market’s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and</li>\n<li><strong>Proterra Energy:</strong> Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Company’s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems, more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54 megawatts of charging systems.</p>\n\n<p>Proterra operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as well as a state-of-the-art R&amp;D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company recently announced the opening of a new battery production line co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County. This battery production line was established within a year and demonstrates Proterra’s ability to bring its scalable and capital-efficient battery manufacturing process directly to commercial vehicle OEMs alongside their existing manufacturing.&quot; Pulled from <a href=\"https://www.proterra.com/company/investors/\">investors portal on Proterra&#39;s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Proterra is going public via a SPAC merger ticker <strong>ACTC.</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Proterra-Release.pdf\">press statement</a> released on January 12th, 2021 suggests that the merger is &quot;expected to close in the first half of 2021&quot;. There is some speculation regarding the date; they’ve already filed the S-4, so the timeline for merger vote looks to be around end of March to April first week according to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/le6yur/proterra_actc_merger/\">this post</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1820630&amp;owner=exclude\">the SEC website.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Investors:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Franklin Templeton, Broadscale, 40 North, G2VP, Chamath Palihapitiya, and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC</p>\n\n<p><strong>Funds and Accounts Managed By:</strong></p>\n\n<p>BlackRock, Neuberger Berman Funds and affiliates of ArcLight.</p>\n\n<h1>Leadership</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jack Allan, CEO, from Navistar and Valspar</li>\n<li>Amy Ard, CFO, from AMG, PCC, and PWC</li>\n<li>Dustin Grace, CTO, from Tesla and Honda</li>\n<li>John Ensign, COO, from Tesla and Honeywell</li>\n<li>JoAnn Covington, CLO, from EA and Rocket Fuel</li>\n<li>Gareth Joyce, President, from Delta and Mercedes-Benz</li>\n<li>Rick Huibregtse, Sr. VP Engineering, from Remy and Delphi</li>\n<li>John Walsh, Sr. VP of Sales, from Rev and Davey Coach</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Board of Directors</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jack Allen, Chairman from Navistar and Valspar</li>\n<li>Ryan Popple, Co-Founder and Executive Director from Tesla and KPCB</li>\n<li>Jake Erhard, Direct Nominee from ArcLight and Schroders</li>\n<li>Jennifer Granholm, Director <strong>Secretary of the DoE</strong> and CNN</li>\n<li>Constance Skidmore, Director from PWC</li>\n<li>Mike Smith, Director from Constellation</li>\n<li>Brook Porter, Director from G2VP and KPCB</li>\n<li>Jeannine Sargent, Director from Flex and Aerlikon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t highlight Jennifer Granholm enough, she is the Secretary of the Department of Energy with a green Biden administration in a company that has 50% of the US Market already.

Proterra generated $193mm</p>\n\n<p><strong>Production Track Record:</strong> Again, Romeo is the not-so-close second having produced minimal items and being founded in 2016.

With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10 years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding post-merger which is expected to happen end of March-first week in April (although the official statement is &quot;the first half of this year&quot;). </p>\n\n<p>The company is currently undervalued by 116.42% on fundamentals alone, and that&#39;s on the &quot;fair&quot; end. When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it&#39;s just another EV company, because it&#39;s an established, well-connected, constantly growing <em>commercial</em> EV company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bear Case:</strong> I literally can&#39;t think of one aside from the merger falling apart. If someone could provide a bear case in the comments for Proterra (assuming the merger is successful) I would love to discuss it, because either I&#39;m missing something glaringly obvious or this might be my greatest pick.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am long on this with my shares. I will be holding all my shares for several years, my calls I will exercise half after the merger and sell the rest for a nice profit. If you want to just play the merger that&#39;s an option too. Meaning just hold until the merger date and sell at whatever you think the peak is that very day.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Buy shares, ACTC will change to PTRA after the merger. Shares will be 1:1</li>\n<li>Warrants, ACTCW, if you&#39;re not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50</li>\n<li>Calls, I think virtually anything listed is going to print (aside from 03/19)</li>\n<li>Selling puts, the premiums are hefty so either you&#39;ll get a nice premium or you&#39;ll own some shares at a really nice discount.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Positions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>3,865 shares @ 22.37</p>\n\n<p>10C 04/16 $20.00</p>\n\n<p>12C 05/21 $22.50</p>\n\n<p>17C 05/21 $25.00</p>\n\n<p>6C 08/20 $35</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Fundamental&#39;s alone show this company is already <strong>116.42% undervalued</strong>, factor in hype, forward-thinking, IPO, etc. and I can&#39;t even come up with a PT. I would <em>expect</em> a PT post-merger to travel upwards to ~$50-$60 and settle back down no lower than $34. EOY my prediction is ~$70-$80. 2025 prediction is ~$300-$500. I recommend you read. I wouldn&#39;t want to gloss this one over if I were you.

Plus...this thing doesn&#39;t need to get pumped. I&#39;m just trying to share the find.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
