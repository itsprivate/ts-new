To achieve this purpose, the report comprehensively reviews survey, theoretical and empirical studies regarding technical trading strategies.\n* The survey literature indicates that technical analysis has been widely used by market participants in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and that about 30% to 40% of practitioners appear to believe that technical analysis is an important factor in determining price movement at shorter time horizons up to 6 months.\n* We provide an overview of theoretical models that include implications about the profitability of technical analysis. Conventional efficient market theories, such as the martingale model and random walk models, rule out the possibility of technical trading profits in speculative markets, while relatively recent models such as noisy rational expectation models or behavioral models suggest that technical trading strategies may be profitable due to noise in the market or investors’ irrational behavior\n* Early studies indicated that technical trading strategies were profitable in foreign exchange markets and futures markets, but not in stock markets before the 1980s. Modern studies indicated that technical trading strategies consistently generated economic profits in a variety of speculative markets at least until the early 1990s. Among a total of 92 modern studies, 58 studies found positive results regarding technical trading strategies, while 24 studies obtained negative results. Ten studies indicated mixed results.\n* Despite the positive evidence on the profitability of technical trading strategies, it appears that most empirical studies are subject to various problems in their testing procedures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTechnical analysis is a forecasting method of price movements using past prices, volume, and open interest.2 Pring (2002), a leading technical analyst, provides a more specific definition:\n\n>“The technical approach to investment is essentially a reflection of the idea that prices move in trends that are determined by the changing attitudes of investors toward a variety of economic, monetary, political, and psychological forces. The art of technical analysis, for it is an art, is to identify a trend reversal at a relatively early stage and ride on that trend until the weight of the evidence shows or proves that the trend has reversed.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Technical analysis includes a variety of forecasting techniques ... However, academic research on technical analysis is generally limited to techniques that can be expressed in mathematical forms, namely technical trading systems, although some recent studies attempt to test.\n* Since Charles H. Dow first introduced the Dow theory in the late 1800s, technical analysis has been extensively used among market participants such as brokers, dealers, fund managers, speculators, and individual investors in the financial industry. 3 Numerous surveys indicate that practitioners attribute a significant role to technical analysis.\n* For example, futures fund managers rely heavily on computer-guided technical trading systems (Irwin and Brorsen 1985; Brorsen and Irwin 1987; Billingsley and Chance 1996), and about 30% to 40% of foreign exchange traders around the world believe that technical analysis is the major factor determining exchange rates in the short-run up to six months (e.g., Menkhoff 1997; Cheung and Wong 2000; Cheung, Chinn, and Marsh 2000; Cheung and Chinn 2001).\n* In contrast to the views of many practitioners, most academics are skeptical about technical analysis. Rather, they tend to believe that markets are informationally efficient and hence all available information is impounded in current prices (Fama 1970). In efficient markets, therefore, any attempts to make profits by exploiting currently available information are futile.\n* Nevertheless, in recent decades rigorous theoretical explanations for the widespread use of technical analysis have been developed based on noisy rational expectation models (Treynor and Ferguson 1985; Brown and Jennings 1989; Grundy and McNichols 1989; Blume, Easley, and O’Hara 1994), behavioral (or feedback) models (De Long et al. 1990a, 1991; Shleifer and Summers 1990), disequilibrium models (Beja and Goldman 1980), herding models (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein 1992), agent-based models (Schmidt 2002), and chaos theory (Clyde and Osler 1997). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Survey Studies**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The oldest survey study regarding technical analysis dates back to Stewart (1949), who analyzed the trading behavior of customers of a large Chicago futures commission firm over the 1924-1932 period. The result indicated that in general traders were unsuccessful in their grain futures trading, regardless of their scale and knowledge of the commodity traded\n* Amateur speculators were more likely to be long than short in futures markets.\n* Smidt (1965a) surveyed trading activities of amateur traders in the US commodity futures markets in 1961.4 In this survey, about 53% of respondents claimed that they used charts either exclusively or moderately in order to identify trends.\n* There was a slight tendency for chartists to pyramid more frequently than other traders.5 It is interesting to note that only 10% of the chartists, compared to 29% of the non-chartists, nearly always took long positions.\n* The Group of Thirty (1985) surveyed the views of market participants on the functioning of the foreign exchange market in 1985. The respondents were composed of 40 large banks and 15 securities houses in 12 countries.\n* 97% of bank respondents and 87% of the securities houses believed that the use of technical analysis had a significant impact on the market.\n* Brorsen and Irwin (1987) carried out a survey of large public futures funds’ advisory groups in 1986. In their survey, more than half of the advisors responded that they relied heavily on computer-guided technical trading systems.\n* Since technically traded public and private futures funds were estimated to control an average of 23% of the open interest in ten important futures markets, the funds seemed large enough to move prices if they traded in unison ( << Interesting point)\n* Frankel and Froot (1990) showed that switching a forecasting method for another over time may explain changes in the demand for dollars in foreign exchange markets. The evidence provided was the survey results of Euromoney magazine for foreign exchange forecasting firms.\n* In 1978, nineteen forecasting firms exclusively used fundamental analysis and only three firms technical analysis. After 1983, however, the distribution had been reversed. In 1983, only one firm reported using fundamental analysis, and eight technical analysis. In 1988, seven firms appeared to rely on fundamental analysis while eighteen firms employed technical analysis.\n* Cheung, Chinn, and Marsh (2000) surveyed the views of UK-based foreign exchange dealers on technical anaysis in 1998. In this survey, 33% of the respondents described themselves as technical analysts\n* Moreover, 26% of the dealers responded that technical trading is the most important factor that determines exchange rate movements over the medium run.\n* Cheung and Chinn (2001) published survey results for US-based foreign exchange traders conducted in 1998. In the survey, about 30% of the traders indicated that technical trading best describes their trading strategy\n* About 31% of the traders responded that technical trading was the primary factor determining exchange rate movements up to 6 months.\n\n(Quite a lot more in this survey section but will leave it at that to keep this somewhat brief)\n\n* In sum, survey studies indicate that technical analysis has been widely used by practitioners in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and regarded as an important factor in determining price movements at shorter time horizons. However, no survey evidence for stock market traders was found.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theory**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Efficient Markets Hypothesis**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe efficient markets hypothesis has long been a dominant paradigm in describing the behavior of prices in speculative markets. Working (1949, p. 160) provided an early version of the hypothesis:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If it is possible under any given combination of circumstances to predict future price changes and have the predictions fulfilled, it follows that the market expectations must have been defective ; ideal market expectations would have taken full account of the information which permitted successful prediction of the price changes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Revised his definition of a perfect futures market to “… one in which the market price would constitute at all times the best estimate that could be made, from currently available information, of what the price would be at the delivery date of the futures contracts (Working, 1962, p. 446).”\n* Identical to the famous definition of an efficient market given by Fama (1970, p. 383): “A market in which prices always ‘fully reflect’ available information is called ‘efficient’.”\n* Thus, technical analysis provides a weak form test of market efficiency because it heavily uses past price history\n\n(I'm going to skip some section now but the full table of content is at the bottom of the post)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chart Pattern Studies**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Chang and Osler evaluated the performance of the head-and-shoulders pattern using daily spot rates for 6 currencies (mark, yen, pound, franc, Swiss franc, and Canadian dollar) during the entire floating rate period, 1973-1994.\n* head-and-shoulders rule s generated statistically significant returns of about 13% and 19% per year for the mark and yen, respectively, but not for the other exchange rates.\n* Returns from the exogenous exit rule appeared to be insignificant in most cases. The trading profits from the endogenous exit rules were substantially higher than either the annual buy-and-hold returns of 2.5% for the mark and 4.4% for the yen or annual average stock yield of 6.8% measured on the S&P 500 index.\n* Chang and Osler further investigated the performance of moving average rules and momentum rules and compared the results with the observed performance of the head-and shoulders rule. Returns from the simple technical trading systems appeared statistically significant for all six currencies and the simpler rules easily outperformed the head-and shoulders rules\n* Hence, Chang and Osler concluded that, although the head-and-shoulders patterns had some predictive power for the mark and yen during the period of floating exchange rates, the use of the head-and-shoulders rule did not seem to be rational, because they were easily dominated by simple moving average rules and momentum rules (<< This is actually a really good point. The way a trend forms means the head and shoulders pattern produces one of the most common false signals and usually a strong counter move when breaking, but the ones that work are important).\n* Caginalp and Laurent (1998) reported that candlestick reversal patterns generated substantial profits in comparison to an average gain for the same holding period. For the S&P 500 stocks over the 1992-1996 period\n* In general, the results of chart pattern studies varied depending on patterns, markets, and sample periods tested, but suggested that some chart patterns might have been profitable in stock markets and foreign exchange markets\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summary and Conclusion**\n\n* Most survey studies indicate that technical analysis has been widely used by market participants in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and that at least 30% to 50 40% of practitioners regard technical analysis as an important factor in determining price movement at shorter time horizons up to 6 months.\n* In the theoretical literature, the conventional efficient markets models, such as the martingale and random walk models, rule out the existence of profitable technical trading (<< All the efficient market stuff is just a theory. It's so often stated as if it is fact)... On the other hand, several other models, such as noisy rational expectations models, feedback models, disequilibrium models, herding models, agent-based models, and chaos theory, suggest that technical trading strategies may be profitable\n* In these models, thus, there exist profitable trading opportunities that are not being exploited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther chapters not mentioned;\n\nThe Martingale Model\n\nRandom Walk Models\n\nNoisy Rational Expectations Models\n\nNoise Traders and Feedback Models\n\nOther Models\n\n13 Summary of Theory\n\nEmpirical Studies\n\nTechnical Trading Systems\n\nDual Moving Average Crossover\n\nOutside Price Channel\n\nRelative Strength Index\n\nAlexander’s Filter Rule\n\nEarly Empirical Studies (1960-1987)\n\nOverview\n\nRepresentative Early Studies\n\nSummary of Early Studies\n\nModern Empirical Studies (1988-2004)\n\nOverview\n\nRepresentative Modern Studies\n\nStandard Studies\n\nModel-Based Bootstrap Studies\n\nGenetic Programming Studies\n\nReality Check Studies\n\nChart Pattern Studies\n\nNonlinear Studies\n\nOther Studies\n\nSummary of Modern Studies\n\nSummary and Conclusion",
