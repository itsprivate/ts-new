Though I was covering a specific sector (retail/luxury/e-commerce), part of the job spec meant creating baskets based on ideas for professional clients. For example, I would create a basket of c20 stocks that we thought was the best way to play the 'reopening post pandemic' or 'the luxury boom in China'. \n\nOften the purpose of this was so that clients who are very generalist can get exposure to macro themes or ideas without having to do the individual stock work which is very time consuming. \n\nI always thought this kind of product may be of interest to retail investors. I.e. you can construct a portfolio with a handful of baskets based on the themes you want to play at the time. For example, as an investor, you might be a data analyst at Google and believe that data is going to transform the world and no one knows it yet... how do you play that trend in the markets? It's hard right!\n\nI'm sharing some of the types of things we used to put together at Morgan Stanley here:\n\n\\- The next FAANGS ([here](https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/msdotcom/what-we-do/wealth-management-images/uit/MSSNF2_Fact_Card.pdf))  \n\\- COVID-19 driven data adopters ([here](https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/msdotcom/what-we-do/wealth-management-images/uit/Data-era-adopters.pdf))\n\nHere's one from UBS that's more just a collection of top ideas ([here](https://secure.ubs.com/public/api/v2/investment-content/documents/pIQk7z9c5Akt5Q3jXCvhWA?apikey=Y8VdAx8vhk1P9YXDlEOo2Eoco1fqKwDk&Accept-Language=de-CH))  \n\n\nJust to also share, thought I'd attach JPM Ams latest guide to the markets ([here](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/mi-guide-to-the-markets-us.pdf))\n\nIf you guys are interested, I want to keep contributing thematic baskets and ideas, written up much better than those above\\^ if there's enough interest? You guys have been here since I got my first job to where I am now so would love to share and help the community in any way! \n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNB/ I'm fully aware of the pitfalls and challenges of thematic investing (just a few [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjSpaX0pe_zAhXCnVwKHaS7B28QFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubs.com%2Fglobal%2Fen%2Fwealth-management%2Fmarketnews%2Fhome%2Farticle%2F_jcr_content.1005818983.file%2FPS9jb250ZW50L2RhbS9pbXBvcnRlZC9jaW9yZXNlYXJjaC9wZGYvMTQvMTkvMTEvOS8xNDE5MTE5L2VuL3VzLzE0MTkxMTkucGRm%2F1419119.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3HhDttoBsSVTQYQgKJySSt)), but my hunch is that it could be interesting to investors who want to have some control but don't want to pick individual stocks due to time/effort constraints.",
