So, for example, each paycheck I can select to debit x% from my paycheck and have that held within my Fidelity account, and then at the end of the quarter that money I've accumulated is put toward the stock with the discount included.\n\nSeems like a pretty good deal, but the stock itself has only increased 84% in the past 5 years looking at the charts on Robinhood. I say \"only\" because relative to some other growth stocks that's nothing to write home about... but I feel like it's a pretty stable company that probably won't be going anywhere any time soon given its diversification, and with the discount included, obviously those gains would be a little higher, too.\n\nIf it were you, would you enroll in this program? How much would you put into the employee stock versus a 401k / other investment accounts? Right now I put 6% into 401k (which is what they match), only 1% into the employee stock, and I've been doing some Robinhood ETFs/index funds/single stocks on the side as well as Coinbase for crypto... I'm just trying to figure out how much to diversify across these in terms of percentages. My income is about $100k this year but I'm in sales so it fluctuates. Last year was lower due to COVID. I was thinking of upping the employee stock to 3% but I'm just not sure long-term what my best bet would be... I guess the other nice advantage with this is that the funds are able to be sold after 1.5 years unlike a 401k, so it is relatively liquid in case of a rainy day.",
