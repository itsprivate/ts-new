And history suggests that in \"bubbly\" markets like we have today, market peaks happen when the yield curve inverts.   This may offer useful signs to watch for to know when to run for the hills.\n\n[Graph 1](https://i.imgur.com/ZPGOiiU.png):  Based on its trajectory over the last ~4 months, the yield curve appears to be heading for an inversion by summer, assuming something doesn't change its trajectory (and to be fair, it could).  Yield curve inversions almost always presage a recession 6-18 months later (average of 15.1 months according to Bank of America).  \n\n[Graph 2](https://i.imgur.com/N1PV6TY.png):   The only exceptions in the last century was a false positive in 1965, and the Great Depression/World War 2 era when the Fed was actively manipulating rates to stabilize the economy and fund the war effort.\n\n[Graph 3](https://i.imgur.com/yMbbJwz.png):  The Fed rate tends to peak or plunge when the yield curve inverts.   Given that it is poised to invert by summer, and [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) is currently predicting the Fed rate will be ~1.25-1.50%, the current tightening cycle may not make it to 2%.   This is important, because in previous recessions, the Fed has lowered rates by ~5% when a recession hits to stimulate the economy.  You can't do that when rates are 1.5%. \n\n[Graph 4](https://i.imgur.com/dYQkQuA.png)/[Graph 5](https://i.imgur.com/dPgF40S.png):  These compare the yield curve with stocks (as shown by the detrended S&amp;P 500) and housing prices (as shown by real Case-Shiller HPI).  For \"bubbly\" markets like stocks in 2000/2008 and homes in 1989/2007, yield curve inversions tend to mark market tops, with prices peaking or plunging soon thereafter.\n\n[Graph 6](https://i.imgur.com/l6dWpe1.png):  This takes multiple valuation measures (Shiller PE, detrended log real S&amp;P price, Tobin's Q, Buffett Indicator, and Aggregate Investor Equity Allocation for stocks; Case-Shiller HPI, FHFA All-Transactions HPI, Freddie Mac HPI, and Zillow ZHVI for housing) and graphs the z-score of them so we can compare apples to apples.   We can see we're in both a massive stock (3rd largest in the last 140 years) and housing bubble (largest in the last 130 years).",
