Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.</p>\n\n<p>The income-based measures <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html\">were put in place</a> as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<p>Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.</p>\n\n<p>The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&amp;P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html\">she would be comfortable</a> with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.</p>\n\n<p>At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.</p>\n\n<p>“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”</p>\n\n<p>Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
