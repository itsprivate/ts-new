Its like DRIP, except when you DRIP you are buying the stock when it is the farthest possible away from payout another dividend. This way you use the dividends from other stocks to buy stocks that are closer to the ex-dividend date. Ideally in this strategy you would want to have a list of stocks such that there is always one of them close to their ex-dividend date.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
