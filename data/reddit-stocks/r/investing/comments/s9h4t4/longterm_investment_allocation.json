I am in my early 20's and unbeknownst to me until recently, a family member wrote some bonds in my name. I just cashed them out and while I do not want to give specifics, I have a sizable amount of $ to invest. \n\nI currently have about 75% of my portfolio in ETFs (long-term, do not touch), 15% in individual stocks, and 10% in crypto. I studied Finance in college and started investing in 2020. From then until mid-2021 I averaged about 40% annual returns, but I know that this was inflated by the post-lockdown bubble. I have been seeing some negative returns during this market downturn over the past 6ish months. Some of my top holdings include VTI, VGT, IBB in addition to many tech stocks and BTC/ETH. \n\nMy question for y'all is, do you think I should add this new $ into the same asset allocation or consider other options? With rising interest rates I know that we are going to see lots of change. I am very open to new ideas but ideally would prefer to not have to worry about most of the investments and hold for the long-term. For reference, I've been looking into VOO, SPY, SDY, QQQ, IWF, and VYM but am not very confident about the major differences between them.\n\nThanks in advance!",
