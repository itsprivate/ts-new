Even though software engineering is a field where it&#39;s notoriously hard to determine who is actually a skilled engineer, there is the possibility that PLTR has the best and brightest software engineers out of most tech companies.</p>\n\n<p>Unity software isn&#39;t just for video games. But it has potential to be extended to creating all manner of interactive 3D software in general. For example doing VR training simulation for jobs, or VR education (traveling back to ancient Rome in a history class). The bull case would be that Unity eventually becomes the Adobe for 3D interactive content.</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade plans on releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months (based off of the latest interview I&#39;ve watched with the CEO). Their software is designed in such a way that it is easy to do this. A lot of people who&#39;ve done preliminary research on Lemonade, believes that they just do renter&#39;s insurance and are sticking with that. But 3 months ago they&#39;ve released pet insurance. They&#39;re planning on releasing life insurance next month, and then there&#39;s the possibility of car insurance afterwards.  The CEO has also stated that he understands the importance of intersecting humanity&#39;s (art/design) with tech, and that this is a valuable way to capture one of the most scarce commodities, mindshare. Which is why the &quot;Lemonade app&#39;s workflow looks and feels a lot better than going on Geico, Statefarm, Allstate, etc...&quot; (CFO&#39;s words, not mine).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Yeah a lot of people may be aware of these facts, but I think most investors <em>might</em> not be aware of them. Also I was just trying to give examples.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
