  "selftext": "Hope this post might be helpful particularly for newer investors or people that want to invest but aren't really comfortable with the level of risk on equities, or who struggle to push their money in because they are afraid of a downturn soon after. I want to show you that you can still achieve good returns with low risk. In fact your risk-adjusted returns can be clearly superior.\n\nWe all know that stocks tend to offer the highest possible returns in the long run, but the problem is that stocks come with a level of drawdown risk &gt;50%. This can be very problematic for people who are not comfortable with the idea of high drawdown. It is even more problematic for people who think they are comfortable with high risk but then find out when it happens, that they are not. This puts you at risk of committing the cardinal sin of investing – which is cashing out at a hefty loss, and not only locking in a loss, but locking yourself out of future recovery and eventual gains. \n\nEvery investor must honestly appraise the level of risk they are taking and find a level which they are genuinely comfortable with in order to avoid the cardinal sin. The problem that creates is that you have to compromise on expected returns, but IMO too many people don’t properly explore the middle ground and understand the compromise can be net beneficial and individually tailored to suit.\n\nDiversifying between asset classes exposes you to different levels of return and risk, but critically offers you assets which are uncorrelated or perhaps somewhat negatively correlated. This leads to the so-called ‘diversification gain’. The diversification gain is essentially the benefit you receive by never taking a massive drawdown. It is better to be taking moderate returns on a consistently larger amount of money than higher returns on a potentially much smaller amount of money. Perhaps not in terms of absolute return in the long-long run, but we’ll come to that later.\n\nSo what are the asset classes we are going to look at? I have chosen US Stock Market, US Intermediate Term Treasuries, Gold, and Cash. The comparison is simple – we’ll look at 100% stocks (the high benchmark), 100% cash (which will show you why you need to invest), and a balanced portfolio. The balanced portfolio is 45% US stocks, 32% treasuries, 8% gold, and 15% cash.\n\nNow, before any jumps on me – yes, that is conservative. And yes, there are other classes that could be included, and yes this weight to that or that weight to the other might be ‘better’, but not the point of the post. The point is to simply look at the benefit of diversification on risk control and the compromise on returns, and what can be achieved even with a conservative approach, which I personally found surprisingly good.\n\nI will just say a word about cash, though – the idea of cash being there is because most people, especially risk-averse people, do want to keep some cash and there is often a real-life potential need for it (unemployment, unexpected expenses etc.). It is also surprising how good the returns can be in spite of keeping cash. Further, it avails you of rebalancing opportunities, something 100% stock investors simply do not have, but I’m not going to get into that here and I’ll mention why at the end.\n\nThe backest will be done as far back as it can be done on [this tool]( https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/), which is 1972. It is very helpful that we can go back to the 70s, because we can walk through a period of high inflation and tightening monetary policy. Too many backtests only look at the post-1987 easy money era, or even the post-2008 QE era. These tests will give misleading results if the monetary conditions change. However, I’ll also show results for those to show the compromise is not too great.\n\nSo, [these are the portfolios]( https://imgur.com/a/dD5iBhS). Portfolio 1 – 100% stocks, Portfolio 2 – the balanced approach, Portfolio 3 – 100% cash (which is cash earning about what it would in a savings account btw). Portfolio 2 is rebalanced annually.\n\nAnd [these are the results from 1972 until April 2022](https://imgur.com/a/PgAR4TL) – a 50 year investment horizon.\n\nYour eyes are perhaps jumping right to the final returns, but this isn’t where they should be. Why? Firstly, you cannot be 100% stocks into retirement otherwise you are risking &gt;50% drawdown on the day you retire, and if that happens you aren’t retiring. You are going back to work until that 50% is back one way or another (or slightly less considering you get older in the meantime). If you’re relying on the market, good luck, you now need it to go up 100% to make your money back and this might take a long time.\n\nThe second reason is that you can still achieve the same return by stretching the investment horizon out, i.e. you consciously accept you might have to retire a few years later, but that your date will be better known, and your life will be much less stressful. It is impossible to chase early retirement by constantly pursuing high returns without risking much later retirement. A sensible rebalancing strategy towards conservative assets as you get close to retirement is the best approach, but again it’s not going to be covered here.\nIn this case, a 59 year investment horizon instead of a 50 year investment horizon would approximately equalize the returns between portfolios 1&amp;2. This is not in itself desirable, but what do you get for it?\n\nThe key is the lower drawdown. Portfolio 2 risks 20%, portfolio 1 risks 50%. That is a huge difference. And what is the difference in growth? Portfolio 1 has a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 10.5% and portfolio 2 has a CAGR of 8.9%. So really, that’s a lot of extra risk for a small overall improvement in performance. It is true that bit extra makes a big difference in the end, but then you have to face the problems of the previous paragraphs.\n\nWhat really strikes me is the smoothness of portfolio 2’s equity vs portfolio 1. It’s just a pretty much constant gain with only gentle drawdowns. Look at the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. The Sharpe ratio is measure of deviation from risk-free return, the higher the deviation the lower the Sharpe. The Sortino ratio is similar but only considers downside risk – it shows how much excess return you are getting per unit of risk (if we consider risk to be drawdown) – in my mind it is the more useful indicator here.\nWhat is also notable is that there have been periods where portfolios 1&amp;2 have approximately equalized. In 2008, portfolio 2 actually became the better performer, 36 years after the start of backtest. That’s kind of incredible considering the respective risks. Astonishingly, this result still occurs if you start the backtest at a very favourable time for portfolio 1, which I’ll show below. \n\nA word on data-framing. So yes, in 1974 there was a big downturn on the stock market and maybe it’s not fair to start the backtest in 1972. So let’s make this very flattering for the stock market and start in 1988, after the 1987 crash, and heralding the start of the modern easy money era with Greenspan deploying QE and the Fed put for the first time.\n[It’s really not that bad for portfolio 2]( https://imgur.com/a/SBBsw9j). Portfolio 1 has a notably higher CAGR, but still much greater risk, and the Sharpe and Sortino ratios indicate portfolio 2 is the better risk-adjusted performer. And again, there was a period of merging the last time the stock market suffered. And this is if we really frame portfolio 1 favourably. \n[Now let’s do the opposite, and compare since the top of DotCom in 2000]( https://imgur.com/a/DNPpGmi). Portfolio 1 still has it’s nose out in front, but only fairly recently, and the smoothing which portfolio 2 provides is now starkly apparent. Look at the consistency of portfolio 2’s curve (and remember, there is 15% cash in here, during an era of historically low rates!). Portfolio 2 is clearly the best risk-adjusted performer. The Sharpe and Sortino ratios are incomparably better.\n\nBy now you should see that in all conditions a balanced approach yields moderate-good returns with low drawdown, whereas all equities offers a higher CAGR but at the expense of much greater risk. Assessed by risk-adjusted return, the balanced approach is clearly superior.\n\nSo that’s about it really. I’m aware that we can tinker with this and that, but my point is just to show what diversification brings, and the returns that can still be had even with a very conservative weight that includes 15% cash and 8% gold.\n\nI hope it helps some people who aren’t really sure what to do by giving them some perspective and a viable approach. If you buy portfolio 2, you sleep well at night, you don’t worry and you don’t make mistakes. You make moderate amounts of money most of the time, and you risk only about 20%. You can keep your investments liquid and draw on them if needed. You also have a consistent approach to take to retirement. Further, you can also think about rebalancing strategies, which if performed well, can even further improve portfolio 2, but I am going to leave this because it’s not necessary and is timing to some degree. I’d encourage you to play around with the portfolio tool if you want to tweak it to something which is perfect for you personally. \n\nFurther discussion/views welcomed.",
