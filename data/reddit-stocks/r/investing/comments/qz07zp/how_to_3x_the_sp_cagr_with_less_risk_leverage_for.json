Michael has found a way to systemically outperform the S&P 500 by over 3x while taking on less risk and it's an extremely simple investment strategy.\n\nEveryone says that triple leveraged ETFs have volatility decay and are not meant for long-term holding. Well guess what, those people are idiots. Let's look at the data: If you invested in UPRO using this guy's simple strategy, backtested all the way back to 1928, you would have returned 27% CAGR while the S&P did 9% and by taking on half as much risk (0.6 Sharpe ratio for this strategy vs. 0.3 for buy & hold.\n\nThe rules are simple, if the underlying index closes below the 200 day moving average, you sell. Once it crosses back above the 200 MA, then reenter. That is it. **Investing $10k in 1928 with this strategy would have returned $28 TRILLION (with a T) while the S&P would have returned $39 million.**\n\nThe reason this works is because of the lack of volatility above the 200 MA, and higher volatility below the 200 MA.\n\nEnjoy the sweet taste of compounding returns my friends because this is a ticket to an early retirement.\n\nTLDR: Read the damn paper.",
