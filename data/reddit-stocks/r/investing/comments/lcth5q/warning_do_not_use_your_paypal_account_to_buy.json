Here&#39;s a quick example and a best case scenario too.  You use your PP account to buy $5000 worth of coin, their fee is a &quot;modest&quot; 1.5% for that (fees are higher below $1000) So you paid $75 right out of the gate, now let&#39;s say it has (a very unlikely) run and wow you doubled your money. You cash out at $10k, now PP takes another $150 (1.5%) to sell your coin. So your actual profits are $5000 and your PP fees are $250, boom they zinged you for <strong>5% of your total profits.</strong> And that&#39;s all best case scenario.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
