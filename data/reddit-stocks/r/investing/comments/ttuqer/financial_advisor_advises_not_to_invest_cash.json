She is a medical student currently and won't be touching that money for the next 3.5 years due to her being in school; she was planning to use part of that money for a down payment for a house when she finishes school.\n\nHer account consists of 70k, with 60k being in cash, I urged her to talk to her financial advisor to figure out why 60k is being left in cash as with rising inflation rates, as it will just lose value over the years. She talked to her financial advisors, and they stated that the market is volatile currently and isn't a smart move to invest all the cash, as she is very risk-averse.  They even stated that putting that money into bonds isn't the correct decision either.\n\nI'm not a financial advisor, but I'm confused, isn't it better to put your money into VOO/VTI and Bonds if you aren't going to be touching your cash for the next 3.5 years? It seems like just sitting on 60k to devalue over the upcoming years isn't the smartest financial decision? The only way I can see that being correct is if there is a recession coming, but no one can predict that.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nedit: Again, I am just seeking advice and an understanding of the decisions made. I am not advising her to do anything with her money or will be managing her financial decisions, but apparently even asking for advice has to be labeled as wrong or right.",
