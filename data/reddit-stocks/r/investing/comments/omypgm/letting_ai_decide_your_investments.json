Since my first post here a short time ago (about building a  small position in $GDRX), I wanted to raise another thought about one  strategy for optimizing long-term returns in a portfolio.  I recently  had discovered a fund called the AI Powered Equity ETF.  Most crucial to  know is that it is an actively managed fund, managed by none other than  the IBM Watson supercomputer!  For those who don't already know what  IBM Watson is, it is the supercomputer made most famous on the Jeopardy  show, which was the first \"contestant\" to beat Ken Jennings who had won  millions after remaining the contender for months.  Watson is used in  medical research and has been found to be able to diagnose cancer in patients prior to oncology teams.  It has a sophisticated set of  programs that allow it to comb through many terabytes of data in seconds, and then to use probability calculations to root out the most  likely solution/response/correct answer to a problem or data set it is  fed.  Here's an interesting article about recent performance of the AIEQ in trading momentum stocks that are not typically part of the \"meme  stock\" rallies.\n\nSince one of my portfolios is through M1 Finance, I added a weighting to this  fund, essentially as a way to potentially hedge against volatility in QQQ and some Ark funds I DCA into weekly.  The position is relatively  low in the portfolio (<10%).  While the returns aren't particularly  striking, I think this might be the strength of this fund overall.  I  believe Watson trades not to \"maximize\" returns, but rather to  \"optimize\" them.  Note I don't have any scientific evidence for this.   However, my suspicion is that Watson has an algorithm that uses trend discovery in momentum plays, to target optimizing for risk-adjusted  return.  Aka, \"How can I get you the best bang for the buck, while  simultaneously making your risk the absolute lowest I can?\"  Would you  be open to a supercomputer trading for you for a somewhat higher fee?   Could AIEQ be one of the first actively managed funds to consistently  beat the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis, even in spite of its  expense ratio?  Do you think this could be an effective way of hedging  risk against the emotions of other human active managers, or as a  parachute for stocks that take a nosedive in a bear market?  Look forward to what you all think!",
