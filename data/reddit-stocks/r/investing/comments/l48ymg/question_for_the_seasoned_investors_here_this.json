It&#39;s becoming unhealthy. Surely the old folks here that have seen some other types of markets can actually share some thoughs and experiences on this, because you can&#39;t deny that the last months have been CRAZY: everyone and their mom seems to be into stocks.</p>\n\n<p>You can try to justify this rally al you want with the M2 money supply charts, the hype around tech and the american patriotism, the &quot;new world order&quot; etc., but valuations just don&#39;t lie and THEY MATTER. Right? Do valuations matter? Because that is what I was taught, but everybody seems to have forgotten this. Everybody overlooks the fact that, during the last 150 years, stocks were more expensive than this only during the dot-com bubble.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, will things ever get back to normal? <strong>And don&#39;t misunderstand me</strong>: I don&#39;t mean that stocks prices need to plunge, I just mean that valuations need to, which is not necessarily the same. And if they do, and all of this goes bust, is this crazy new interest around stocks here to stay for good or will the majority of people move on once the dust has settled? Was the dot-com like this on a retail level?</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not talking about GME, that is clearly a once in a decade squeeze event ... I&#39;m talking about everything else</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
