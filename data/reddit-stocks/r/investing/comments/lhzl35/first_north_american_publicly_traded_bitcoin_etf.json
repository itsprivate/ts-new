Last month, President Joe Biden appointed a new SEC chair, prompting hopes that a bitcoin ETF could be approved in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>The OSC’s approval of BTCC could nudge other markets to see similar products come to light.</p>\n\n<p>“The SEC will definitely feel the pressure to allow such a product to come to the marketplace because there are already products in the market that are taking advantage of the exposure of bitcoin that are not efficient for investors and are not being done in a regulated format like the SEC would want,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin holdings are kept in “cold storage” – an offline custodian that cannot be hacked. Gemini Trust Company LLC will be sub-custodian for the fund, and CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Co. will act as fund administrator.</p>\n\n<p>BTCC has a 1 per cent management fee, and will invest in the physical form of bitcoin rather than futures that would allow investors to speculate on the price at a later date. The fund will track the TradeBlock XBX Index, which uses an algorithm to calculate the consolidated price of bitcoin every second.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
