Now the situation got me a bit confused. \n\nThe news: [https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-announces-binding-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-assets-of-cylix-data-in-32-35-million-transaction/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-announces-binding-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-assets-of-cylix-data-in-32-35-million-transaction/)\n\nIn short, company A signed a LOI to acquire company B to get to the big data market. A, B or C now doesn’t matter because the question is more technical. I read the press release and see this part in transaction details: \n\n>**\"Transaction Details**  \n>  \n>Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company (A) will purchase the Business (B) for consideration of $32,350,000 (the “**Transaction**”), to be satisfied through the issuance by the Company of 64,700,000 units (the “**Purchaser Units**”) at a deemed price of $0.50 per Purchaser Unit, with each Purchaser Unit comprised of one common share of the Company (a “**Common Share**”) and one-seventh (1/7) of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a “**Purchaser Warrant**”). Each Purchaser Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one additional Common Share of Xigem at a price of $0.60 for a period of 24 months.\"\n\nThe question: can they really do it? I might be overthinking but it looks strange. They expect to get to the $0,50 mark in the next 24 months? That’s over 300% from today (ok, from the previous close). Is it good for shareholders or something’s not right?",
