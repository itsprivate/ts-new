There's nowhere else to park money, I get it. I'm just asking... when is that going to stop being the answer? \n\nWhen are people going to run out of cash to deploy? How many people are really buying in at these levels weekly with any sizable volume? I get it, everybody here is dollar-cost-averaging $500/mo into their 401k irregardless and they want a badge of honor on how they ignore the market and are sticking to their great 30 year long investment plan. Amazing. Congratulations. My question is... is that's what is driving the market up 40% in 14 months? Regular John Smith's 401k on his $120k/yr salary? I doubt it.\n\nI thought on a good year, when earnings beat estimates and forecasts were positive and not revised downward, we could reliably expect companies to grow so much that overall the market averages 10% of growth before inflation.\n\nHow the heck are we up 39% from August 2020 to now? Are the 505 companies inside of the S&P 39% more profitable/forward looking than they were then? \n\nThe money the Fed printed for stimulus + CoVID relief... has it left the \"banking\" system? It went fed -> banks. Are the banks lending it out? If not... I know that money \"exists\" on paper but... is it really in circulation? Who got it and who spent it?",
