Examples include, long/short funds, commodity ETFs, precious metals, collectibles.\n\nA number of academic studies and analysis by various asset managers has indicated a benefit to risk-return profiles of portfolios given an allocation (most sources suggest between 5-20% weight of total  portfolio) to alternatives. The performance of bonds and stocks in 2022  have largely been poor, and this time will be remembered as one of the rare times high quality bonds and stocks have both performed poorly at  the same time. Various alternatives such as infrastructure, commodities, and real estate have comparatively performed well YTD, showing their value in market conditions where stocks and bonds happen to show higher correlations, along with their long term ability to reduce volatility.  Many alternatives are poorly correlated or uncorrelated with stocks and  bonds, providing additional diversification.\n\nJust interested to know people's views on alternatives, and if they are a part of your portfolios? If yes, why and how do you gain exposure to these assets?",
