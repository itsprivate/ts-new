I am posting this for investors in Uber and Lyft because this month my earnings driving rideshare have fallen off a cliff. I'm talking about dropping from 2K a week down to $300-$600 a week. I see this sentiment repeated by other rideshare drivers in the relevant subs and it seems to be happening around the U.S. in all regions.\n\nSo I'm guessing that each company's revenue from rides (at least in the U.S.)  has plummeted this month. I\"m not sure that's germane to the long-term prospects of each stock but wanted to warn the community that, based on my experiences, each company's U.S. revenue is likely to shrink this month (and possibly for the fiscal quarter).\n\nThis is my first post in this sub, so please give me feedback about whether this is worth posting.",
