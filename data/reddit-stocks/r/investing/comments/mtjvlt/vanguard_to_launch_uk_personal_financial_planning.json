But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.</p>\n\n<p>And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.</p>\n\n<p>Vanguard hopes its new &#39;personal financial planning&#39; service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.</p>\n\n<p>It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.</p>\n\n<p>Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.</p>\n\n<p>Hagerty says: &#39;We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard&#39;s range of funds.</p>\n\n<p>Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a &#39;digital financial planning experience&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.</p>\n\n<p>Hagerty says: &#39;Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. </p>\n\n<p>These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.</p>\n\n<p>Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.</p>\n\n<p>Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.</p>\n\n<p>Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.</p>\n\n<p>Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.</p>\n\n<p>Hagerty adds: &#39;With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.</p>\n\n<p>New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.</p>\n\n<p>Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.</p>\n\n<p>Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for &#39;personalised planning and advice&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for &#39;investment advice&#39; on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.</p>\n\n<p>Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.</p>\n\n<p>Fidelity offers a &#39;Wealth Management&#39; investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
