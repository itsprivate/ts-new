To meet customer and market demands, we grew our headcount almost 6X from 700 to nearly 3800 in that time period.\n\nThis rapid headcount growth has led to some duplicate roles and job functions, and more layers and complexity than are optimal. After carefully considering all these factors, we determined that making these reductions to Robinhood’s staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers.",
