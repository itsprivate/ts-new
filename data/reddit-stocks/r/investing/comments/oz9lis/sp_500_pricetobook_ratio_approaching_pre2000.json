It's just rather notable that P/B has not deviated this much, this rapidly, in the last twenty years besides in 2000 and 2008.  While admirable to believe that, because some other singular metric, e.g. NASDAQ 100, isn't as pronounced, it just tells us that the distribution of systemic risk is manifest differently.  All of these factors should be weighed together, in concordance with your particular investing strategy.**  \n\n**Because a fair value metric (DCF-based) is a much more complex exercise, there is no widely published fair value for the S&P.  In the absence of that sophisticated a metric across the index, the correlation between capital liquidity and P/B warrants closer attention.  This is NOT guidance nor is it a valuation exercise.**\n\nThe Price to Book Ratio, a much discussed metric in the world of [Graham-and-Doddsville](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/valueinvesting/files/files/Buffett1984.pdf), indicates the premium over tangible book value at which a given stock or index is trading.  When analyzed over time, coupled with other economic and market indicators, it has notable worth as a predictor of stock market bubbles.\n\nThe [S&P 500 P/B ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-book), rocketing to 4.73, up \\~57% from March of 2020, is approaching levels not seen since just before the April 2000 market crash—in which the total market, continuing to decline into 2001-2002, lost 75% of its value from its 2000 high.  An increase in the gap between price and tangible book is often correlated with an increase in downward price pressure. \n\nThat is, the further a given stock departs from its book value, the more likely it is to decline sharply in market price, particularly in response to market-wide adverse impacts, versus those securities trading closer to their book value.  And so, the degree to which prices have deviated *rapidly* from overall book value, notably comparable to the increases in P/B just before the crashes of 2000 and 2008, is certainly cause for concern.\n\nOther indicators, including the [Shiller P/E](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) (which previously surpassed 31 in 1929 and 2000), [Reverse Repos](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000), and [Total Credit to Nonbank Borrowers](https://www.bis.org/statistics/gli.htm) strongly suggest that excess capital liquidity is driving most of these excess valuations which are not at all tracking corresponding growth in operating cash flows or tangible book value.  In sum, cheap money is driving stock prices into the stratosphere disproportionate to actual performance.  This would not be an issue if the capacity of institutional investors to borrow were unlimited, but of course it is not.\n\nEDIT: Even with the glut of retail investor expansion in 2000 and 2020 due to, first, the advent of web trading and now the proliferation of mobile apps, retail investors still only represent about [ten percent](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2021-06-30/retail-traders-account-for-10-of-us-stock-trading-volume-morgan-stanley) of the total daily volume... As a sidenote, overnight reverse repos (see previous link) at the NY Federal Reserve have grown from $817 billion last month to $944 billion yesterday.\n\nThis tracks with Piketty's argument that when the return on capital exceeds the actual growth in the economy, income inequality widens and trends toward a bubble.\n\nIf the next FOMC meeting in September does not produce changes in monetary policy to more sharply curb the excess liquidity injected into global capital markets since the beginning of the pandemic, we could trend past the Shiller P/E high in 2000, which might suggest an even larger crash looming when policymakers have no choice but to respond to, e.g., inflationary impacts.",
