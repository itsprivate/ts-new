When we strip out volatile food and energy costs, we get a “core” headline PCE read of +0.3%, 10 basis points (bps) below what analysts were expecting. This tells us the inflation pain was mostly on the food and energy side last month. Duh.\n\n&gt; What most inflation-watchers, including the Fed, pay close attention to are the year-over-year PCE numbers, and here we’re pretty close to expectations as well: +6.3% on headline (in-line with estimates) and +4.7% on core (+4.8% expected, +4.9% in April). Of course, PCE data is drawn from a series of other economic inputs released previously, so surprises are usually modest at best.\n\n&gt; Where we see some real mashing of the fruit last month is in the Income/Spending areas: while Personal Income gained +0.5% as expected, Real Personal Consumption posted a big drop-off: -0.4% versus a downwardly revised +0.3% the previous month.
