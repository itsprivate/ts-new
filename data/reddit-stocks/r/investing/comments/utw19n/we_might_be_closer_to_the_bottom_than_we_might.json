I tried to keep a large diversified portfolio and like most of the people my portfolio has been down like everyone else. Except that I’ve noticed that most of my positions are more down YTD than most of the global indexes like sp500 or DJIA. So I kept going over and over the companies and comparing their YTD to sp500 and almost all of them are down way more than the spy. \n\nBefore I go on any further, I work in commodities so I don’t ever directly invest into commodities companies simply because I’m aware of the potential risks and volatility and I guess it makes it seem like a very tough position to trade due to high sensitivity of volatile markets.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to get to the bottom of this seemingly disconnect between the average fall of most of the companies and the overall stock market. It was especially weird because the largest heavyweights are your apples amazons and facebooks. So I looked at the performance of [each individual component of SP500 on a YTD basis](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance). I knew that the oil and agricultural stocks have done well this year but the extent has been baffling. Going through the list I got spot 26 (25 actually due to 1st place glitch) before I could find any company that was up YTD that is not agricultural, commodity or oil related. And the pattern sticks. Out of the 127 companies still green YTD I believe about 90% are oil, agricultural or other commodities related companies, with a much higher skew in the top gainers.\n\nSo you might ask yourself, so what? We all knew oil and agricultural are doing well this year, what does have to do with the market overall? Well, I keep seeing on a daily basis discussions and charts about how the market is “only” 20% down and if the history is a guide then there’s more pain to come. I mean could be, I’m not claiming to know the future, but what I am trying to say is that very unique market conditions are giving a wrong impression of the market. Unless you’re specifically invested in commodities, most of the companies you own are already down YTD what they would in a typical market crash (eg Amazon down over 40%). A market crash of 30-40% is quite standard and taking away the outlier of commodities we’re right around that mark. Nasdaq is closer to 30% and at this point it’s probably a more fairly accurate representation of the state of the market. Looking back at previous recessions (2007 and 2001) I cannot pick up a pattern of multi-trillion dollar industry enjoying an unprecedented level of success at a time of general pain and bear market I.e. I do not believe that the skewed market conditions are representative of normal market crashes.\n\nThis is a working theory and I’m happy to have it critiqued and discussed",
