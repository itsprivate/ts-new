This future growth is expected from 2 main factors, licensing deals with Pro sports leagues (NFL) and Disney + Star Wars</p>\n\n<p>I do not think these factors will greatly contribute to EA into the future.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I think this is because EA has been in possession of these exclusive licensing deals for years and even decades. EA has had exclusivity of pro league licensed sports games for as long as most of us have been around, and it’s Star Wars deal has been old news for about half a decade and to make matters worse EA has lost its exclusive deal for Star Wars to Ubisoft (another video game publisher).</p>\n\n<p>These deals are not likely to ale EA more valuable and it is much more likely that EA looses these deals then for EA to actually start making sufficient growth in its revenue or any other area of the company for that matter.</p>\n\n<p>I’d really appreciate anyone else’s thoughts on my evaluation, it’s my first time making a DD post of this depth</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
