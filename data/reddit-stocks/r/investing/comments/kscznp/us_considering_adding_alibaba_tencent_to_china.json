The discussions were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n<p>Shares in Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce firm, finished down 3.9% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange while Tencent, a gaming and social media behemoth, lost 4.7%. Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares closed down just over 5% on the news on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Some investors expressed skepticism, however, that Alibaba and Tencent would face long-term restrictions - given that they are worth a combined $1.3 trillion, widely held by U.S. investors and the likely reputational and financial hit to U.S. stock markets.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s a very bad policy and there’s enough money in Asia, lots and getting bigger, that one shouldn’t force these companies out of America,” said Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Investment Management in Toronto and an investor in the New York Stock Exchange. “Money and markets should be neutral.”</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-alibaba-tencent-idUSKBN29C04Y\">Reuters</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
