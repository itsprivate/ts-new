This phrase is usually misinterpreted to mean that if you buy a risky stock, you’ll have a higher chance of getting a higher reward in the future. This is not what it refers to. The meaning of the phrase is revealed through an understanding of the difference between compensated and uncompensated risk. \n\n-\tCompensated risk is when you take a higher risk that is compensated through a higher expected return. An example is stocks vs bonds. Stocks are systematically more risky than bonds, and over the long run they provide a higher return. Another example is that of small cap stocks. There’s been a lot of research done into the systematic higher risks associated with certain stocks that have certain factors. These stocks should provide a greater return over the long run. Search up factor investing to learn more about this.\n-\tUncompensated risk is when you take a higher risk that is not compensated through a higher expected return. Individual stocks are examples of an uncompensated risk. You take on the risk of the individual company performing poorly and there’s no logical reason why it should lead to expected outperformance. The risks of an individual company are mitigated through the use of diversification. An individual stock on average will give you the market average return. But that individual stock has a higher risk. If you hold 10 stocks, then on average you get the same return but you have mitigated your risk. This is the theory behind index investing.\n\nSo just understand that higher risk ≠ higher return unless that higher risk id a compensated risk. We can’t predict the future, but economic theory can help make better decisions.",
