Or does it?\n\nMaybe others can offer some insight on this, but I think we need to look at a couple other things in addition to earnings. Let's look at the all-time high for the Shiller, which was 44 right before the dot com bust in Feb/March 2000.\n\nIn early 2000 we had:\n\n1. Average corporate AAA bond yield at 7.6% with inflation running at around 3.2%\n2. Unemployment rate at 4.0%\n\nIn early 2022 we have\n\n1. Average corporate AAA bond yield at around 3% with inflation running at 7.5%\n2. Unemployment rate at 3.9%\n\nSo we can easily see that if one were to pull his money out of equities, there simply isn't anywhere else to put the money. Corporate bonds look terrible because of awful yields and inflation, and are vulnerable to rate hikes. This was not the case in 2000, where one could dump his money into PIMCO funds and ride out the crash in equities.\n\nNow some will say \"put money into real estate\"! --well that sector is in an even worse bubble than stocks, and there is a building shortage, rising property taxes etc. Going from one overheated sector on the verge of a crash or correction and into another ins't a solution.\n\nAt the end of the day, it needs to be a massive crisis in the financial markets and doomsday before I sell all my stocks and hold cash or bonds, which will guarantee I lose (lots) of money. Municipals are better, but yields are still below inflation\n\nso is this one reason the market is holding at these levels?",
