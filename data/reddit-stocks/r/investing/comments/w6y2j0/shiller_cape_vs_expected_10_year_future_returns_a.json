In fact, I wasn't aware of R squared before this weekend - so take everything with a major heap of sale. If there's mistakes and such, please feel free to point them out. It's also possible that everything I did was wrong and this is just gibberish. The point of this was to create an exercise for myself as well as create discussion online regarding attractive market options. There could also be a lot of simple mistakes there, but due to time constrains (weekend is finishing) I'm forced to post it online now. If you guys like it and if this even makes sense, I might do something similar in the future again\n\nAlso, I will happily share the Excel with the raw data and analysis. However, I do not know how to. I do not want to share from my personal office online account as I want to keep my reddit profile at least semi-private. If someone can please help me out, I would very much appreciate it. I'm sure my data and analysis needs a lot more work and we can make a editable version where multiple people can contribute\n\nData: Was compiled using freely available MSCI data found online. Historical PE by country MSCI Index was sourced from [Barclays](https://indices.barclays/IM/21/en/indices/static/historic-cape.app)\n\n(data available for download). Then I found corresponding index historical data (took me a lot of time to find I might add) through [MSCI End of Day Index Data Search](https://www.msci.com/end-of-day-data-search). The website is very slow, but it works. For most of the developed markets, the data goes back to 1982, which I thought was sufficient enough to come to reasonable conclusions\n\nMethodology: Using the data obtained above, I calculated 10 year annualized average return for each month (for example Jan 1982 to Jan 1992, Feb 1982 to Feb 1982) for each of the 12 MSCI Indexes: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, UK and USA. Then I used graph on Excel to make the line of best fit through regression analysis for each one of those markets. Because I was using 10 year returns, I could only use the 10 year annualized returns until June 2012 and run Regression analysis on CAPE vs returns until 2012 only as well. For developing countries, like Brazil and India the data set was much more limited, therefore I was forced to use 5 year returns. I also calculated the average 10 year return as well as the standard deviation for the 10 year returns. Then I ran a regression analysis on each of the data sets.\n\nResults:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Country|Current CAPE|Avrg Historical Cape|Average 10 YR Return|StDev of 10YR Return|Expected Future 10 Year Return|Line of Best Fit|R2 Squared|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Australia|20.45|20.48|5.87%|4.02%|6.18%|y = -0.0027x + 0.1149|0.54|\n|Brazil|12.96|14.73|9.27%|18.09%|\\-4.87%|\\-|\\-|\n|Canada|21.49|23.79|6.29%|3.89%|6.13%|y = 0.0004x + 0.0527|0.01|\n|Europe|19.65|20.20|6.14%|5.16%|6.51%|y = -0.0042x + 0.1476|0.35|\n|Germany|16.67|22.87|6.43%|4.86%|8.59%|y = -0.0031x + 0.1376|0.37|\n|Hong Kong|16.62|20.15|8.29%|7.02%|10.32%|y = -0.0051x + 0.188|0.13|\n|India|28.19|11.54|7.68%|12.22%|4.27%|y = -0.0054x + 0.1949|0.26|\n|Japan|20.24|42.29|2.31%|6.40%|6.69%|y = -0.0016x + 0.0993|0.23|\n|Netherlands|28|19.86|7.53%|5.97%|1.32%|y = -0.0058x + 0.1782|0.56|\n|Singapore|13.12|22.20|4.94%|5.20%|8.37%|y = -0.0031x + 0.1244|0.13|\n|UK|16.67|17.54|4.68%|5.24%|5.57%|y = -0.006x + 0.1557|0.25|\n|USA|28.51|24.31|8.29%|5.04%|5.46%|y = -0.0052x + 0.2029|0.76|\n\n \n\nNote: India and Brazil were calculated on a basis of 5 year annualized return due to the lack of data. Unlike other indexes that start in 1982, Brazil index data starts in May 2011 (earliest CAPE available) and India in August 2003.\n\nAnalysis: The data was surprising to say the least. My inspiration came from the book \"A random walk down wallstreet\" where the author Markiel mentions that CAPE Ratio, and that it is the best predictor of future returns. In the book, I believe he mentions that about 45% of the returns in the US stock market can be explained by CAPE Ratio. If my understanding is correct, he must be referencing the R squared. I do not remember which data set he used, but I wasn't able to get similar results.\n\nAustralia: Seems right around historical averages. Nothing too noteworthy, expect maybe a strong correlation (R2)\n\nBrazil: It is the only country with expected negative returns. Brazil data sat was also the most limited, therefore it is hard to make any significant conclusions based on available data. Brazil also has the highest standard deviation. It seems that the Brazilian market has been insanely volatile in the 21st century. I did not run a Regression Analysis because I thought it was moot\n\nCanada: Now this tripped me up big time. In fact, the only reason why I included line of best fit formula was for Canada. Canada has **POSITIVE** relationship on Cape vs Expected returns. The higher the CAPE, the higher is the 10 year expected return. I double checked the numbers. Unless I'm making a mistake somewhere that I'm not aware of, Canada is a fluke.\n\nEurope: Nothing noteworthy with Europe MSCI Index,\n\nGermany: Probably the best/safest investment out of all based on this analysis. German MSCI index seems to be below historical averages, has a pretty strong R2 and is posed for solid growth in the next decade from now\n\nHong Kong: For those wanting to take a risk, this might be a very good opportunity. I'm not at all surprised by this data, and it makes sense on an intuitive level as well. In the 2000s USA went through strong economic growth, but the stock market languished. After 2009 it went on an incredible bull run ending only now. China has spent the 2010s positioning itself from factory of the world to a world-wide brand. Tencent and other companies are now a household name. I took a short glance at the Hang Sek 50 index, and a lot of the top stocks are also Value companies. After tencent, there's a list of 4-5 banks. I checked their revenues and profits online and they have all grown massively in the last decade. Meanwhile the stock market has not moved. Of course banks are generally low P/E but it seems like the Chinese companies are highly undervalued even accounting for that. That being said, any investor should be careful to due high interference of the CCP. As for myself, I would consider buying a small leveraged position, something like Yinn 3x leveraged China ETF. However I will need to research more\n\nIndia: India went through a massive bull run in the 2010s, along with USA. It is only the cyclical nature of the markets that the best performers of the previous decade tend to be lackluster in the next one. I'm not very bullish on India, especially with the sky high valuations\n\nJapan: Japan is just a mess. Their CAPE systematically reached 50s 60s 70s and even peaked at 80s in the 2000s, they were overvalued for a long time even after the asset bubble burst. They seem like they're undervalued now, but honestly I don't think I know enough to say anything meaningful about Japan. If I were to speak out of my ass, I would say they were insanely overvalued from the 1980s all the way to 2010s so CAPE at 20 is not undervalued, but valuations catching up with reality. I would personally steer clear.\n\nNetherlands: Interesting to see that Netherlands is overvalued next to its European peers. I do not know the reason for it. Needs more researching\n\nSingapore: Another very good bet for the future IMO. Yes, R2 is low, but it is a developed economy and they have traditionally been very business savvy. I would definitely look more into investing into Singaporean Markets\n\nUK: Have to say, quite surprised by this one. FTSE 100 hasn't returned much at all since the year 2000. I thought it would mean they're undervalued. but doesn't seem so. Interesting to note that while FTSE 100 (big-cap) stagnated, FTSE 250 (mid-cap) brought in stellar results, tripling since 2000. Definitely warrants further investing. I've also seen some evidence online that only FTSE 100 specifically is undervalued, so maybe a big cap play in the UK?\n\nUSA: Well, I think the amazing bull run is dead. For stellar growth in the coming years, we will have to go down much lower in the near future. Some people say it will happen, others think we're close to the bottom. If it's the latter, I personally wouldn't expect the returns of the last decade and a half going forward. In 2008/9 MSCI CAPE bottomed at 13. We're more than double that now. American markets can't grow exponentially to the corporate profit growth rate anymore without detaching from reality, so something has to give. Either we see a crash and another bull cycle, or a slow upwards growth.\n\nInterestingly enough, USA has the highest R2. I wonder if it's due to highest pricing efficiency due to the largest investor participation.\n\nCriticisms:\n\nThe obvious criticism of Shiller CAPE is Excess Cape. We are in an era of record low interest rates even with the recent hikes. A lot of people will rightfully point out that comparing current values to historical values is at least not painting the full picture i.e. more expensive stocks now make more sense than they did in the 90s. However Shiller CAPE is still one of the most powerful tools at our disposal for predicting future growth\n\nThe other criticism is the limitation of data. I couldn't get any meaningful information about emerging markets. Even for the developed markets, looking 1982-2012 might be too limited.",

That being said, any investor should be careful to due high interference of the CCP. As for myself, I would consider buying a small leveraged position, something like Yinn 3x leveraged China ETF. However I will need to research more&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;India: India went through a massive bull run in the 2010s, along with USA. It is only the cyclical nature of the markets that the best performers of the previous decade tend to be lackluster in the next one. I&amp;#39;m not very bullish on India, especially with the sky high valuations&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Japan: Japan is just a mess. Their CAPE systematically reached 50s 60s 70s and even peaked at 80s in the 2000s, they were overvalued for a long time even after the asset bubble burst. They seem like they&amp;#39;re undervalued now, but honestly I don&amp;#39;t think I know enough to say anything meaningful about Japan. If I were to speak out of my ass, I would say they were insanely overvalued from the 1980s all the way to 2010s so CAPE at 20 is not undervalued, but valuations catching up with reality. I would personally steer clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Netherlands: Interesting to see that Netherlands is overvalued next to its European peers. I do not know the reason for it. Needs more researching&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Singapore: Another very good bet for the future IMO. Yes, R2 is low, but it is a developed economy and they have traditionally been very business savvy. I would definitely look more into investing into Singaporean Markets&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UK: Have to say, quite surprised by this one. FTSE 100 hasn&amp;#39;t returned much at all since the year 2000. I thought it would mean they&amp;#39;re undervalued. but doesn&amp;#39;t seem so. Interesting to note that while FTSE 100 (big-cap) stagnated, FTSE 250 (mid-cap) brought in stellar results, tripling since 2000. Definitely warrants further investing. I&amp;#39;ve also seen some evidence online that only FTSE 100 specifically is undervalued, so maybe a big cap play in the UK?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USA: Well, I think the amazing bull run is dead. For stellar growth in the coming years, we will have to go down much lower in the near future. Some people say it will happen, others think we&amp;#39;re close to the bottom. If it&amp;#39;s the latter, I personally wouldn&amp;#39;t expect the returns of the last decade and a half going forward. In 2008/9 MSCI CAPE bottomed at 13. We&amp;#39;re more than double that now. American markets can&amp;#39;t grow exponentially to the corporate profit growth rate anymore without detaching from reality, so something has to give. Either we see a crash and another bull cycle, or a slow upwards growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, USA has the highest R2. I wonder if it&amp;#39;s due to highest pricing efficiency due to the largest investor participation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Criticisms:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The obvious criticism of Shiller CAPE is Excess Cape. We are in an era of record low interest rates even with the recent hikes. A lot of people will rightfully point out that comparing current values to historical values is at least not painting the full picture i.e. more expensive stocks now make more sense than they did in the 90s. However Shiller CAPE is still one of the most powerful tools at our disposal for predicting future growth&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other criticism is the limitation of data. I couldn&amp;#39;t get any meaningful information about emerging markets. Even for the developed markets, looking 1982-2012 might be too limited.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
