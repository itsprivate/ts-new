  "selftext": "Dividend Irrelevance theory is the belief that dividends do not impact total returns. Basically, for every dollar a company pays out in dividends, that is a dollar they do not have on their balance sheet, so a share of a company is effectively worth that much less, making the whole transaction irrelivant. It's for this reason that many smart investors suggest that chasing dividends is a bad strategy.\n\nWhile dividends themselves are irrelivant, why is it that companies that pay dividends have provided higher historical returns than companies that do not?\n\nMuch of this can be explained by exposure to [Factors](https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/fama-french-5-factor-model/)- most notably, the value factor, profitability factor, and aggressiveness of investment factor.\n\nOn average, companies with a low price to book ratio(value) historically have higher returns than ones with a high price to book ratio, Profitable companies have higher returns than unprofitable ones, and Companies with conservative asset growth have higher returns than companies with aggressive asset growth.\n\nDividend payers in general tend to lean towards these factors. A company that pays a dividend generally has conservative asset growth, as it must limit the rate it expands to be able to pay out the dividend. A company that pays a dividend generally targets profitability, as a steady stream of profits is required to maintain a dividend long term(and unlike buybacks, dividends are usually seen as more of a commitment)\n\nAnd a company that pays a high dividend usually has a low price to book value.\n\nMany professional investors target Factors to enhance their returns. Unfortunately, there really aren't any good ETFs or mutual funds that target all of these factors at once while maintaining low fees. This is especially true of the profitability factor.\n\nHowever, by buying a dividend-based fund such as VYM, you get some level of indirect(but not perfect) exposure to these factors. It's not going to be perfect, as it will miss out on some value & profitable companies like BRK that don't pay dividends, and include some currently unprofitable companies that pay high dividends(ie, in 2020 it would continue to hold XOM even though it is unprofitable). It may also occasionally sell profitable or value companies that cut their dividends.\n\nBut as a retail investor, this is the closest you can get to indexing with a factor tilt other than buying individual factor funds like VTV/VBR. The problem with many of these \"value funds\" is as follows:\n\n1. Many of these value companies are not profitable, and are only considered value because of inflated valuations of assets on balance sheets. For example, Carnival Corp is included in many value funds despite being far from profitability. Profitability is a very significant factor in returns, and Value funds fail to screen for this.\n\n2. These index funds only reconstitute annually. So Unprofitable companies like AMC and GME will continue to be held even after reaching highly inflated valuations. \n\nIn addition to the factor benefits of dividend funds, there is also the liquidity. If you may need to withdraw from your portfolio, the advantage of dividends is they generally decline much slower than market price during downturns. This means that you will need to sell less shares of a high dividend fund to fund your expenses than a general market fund, because more of your withdrawal is coming from dividends than share prices.",
