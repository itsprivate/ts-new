I bought this stock earlier in the week and I plan to hold it for a long time. It’s a young company so could be a bit volatile, but very impressed at what they’re doing in such a short time, and they have a genius CEO who founded workhorse too. </p>\n\n<p>If you look at the analysts covering the stock, there is a median price target of $33 with a high price target of $50. </p>\n\n<p>Nikola is valued at $9 billion+ and Lordstown is only valued at $4.5 billion. Oh yeah... and Lordstown has a REAL product, a REAL manufacturing plant (a massive one they bought from GM in Ohio), and a partnership with Camping World to make electric RV’s.</p>\n\n<p>They are beginning production this year and there’s no reason they should be valued under $5 billion currently with 100,000 pre-orders for their $50,000 truck ($5 billion alone) and the potential for military fleet contracts.
