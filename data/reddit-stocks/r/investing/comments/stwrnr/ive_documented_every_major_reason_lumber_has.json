Keep this in mind.\n\n* Now it's pretty obvious lumber shortages were due to [Wildfires on the west coast](https://www.capitalpress.com/ag_sectors/timber/why-is-there-a-lumber-shortage-in-the-u-s/article_70382602-54fc-11eb-a16b-934c0ae1c18f.html) (No ad [version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210202010056/https://www.capitalpress.com/ag_sectors/timber/why-is-there-a-lumber-shortage-in-the-u-s/article_70382602-54fc-11eb-a16b-934c0ae1c18f.html)), wiping out wood supply at the source.\n\n* Or is it? Lumber shortages were actually because of [COVID-19 restrictions](https://fortune.com/2021/03/20/lumber-prices-2021-chart-when-will-wood-shortage-end-price-of-lumber-go-down-home-sales-cost-update-march/) at the sawmills, without a doubt. Sawmills are working at reduced capacity - we should see declining profits for these folks.\n\n* Actually, it's due to the [mountain pine beetle](https://web.archive.org/web/20210702170646/https://qz.com/), which infested BC forests, causing massive effects of damage and causing forests to need to regrow.\n\n* No, really. It's actually not a supply-side issue at all - lumber prices got here through [massive demand coming from people creating at-home workspaces](https://www.probuilder.com/blog/look-lumber-prices-supply-side) and moving out to rural areas.\n\n* That's nonsense, obviously. The real contributor is [US tariffs on wood import from Canada](https://web.archive.org/web/20210519002332/https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-home-prices-soaring-11617834557), which has been plaguing us for years.\n\n* But these reasons are all wrong, of course. The *real* reason there's a shortage is because of [chemical shortages](https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/news/woodworking-industry-news/chemical-shortages-limited-freight-capacities-reduce-wood-adhesive) from Texas winter storms leading to a [shortage of resin](https://wjactv.com/news/local/lumber-prices-skyrocket-as-shortage-continues), which is integral for plywood.\n\n* Ha - fooled ya. It's nothing to do with lumber production, it's actually all [transportation related](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2021/05/lumber-shortage/).\n\n### Why should I care?\n\nEven if you're not personally invested in lumber, there is a really concerning reason to care about it.\n\nThe vibe you should get above isn't \"gee, that must have been a perfect storm.\" It's that no one actually knows what the hell is going on, and why we're basically back to ATH's a year after the \"shortage\" has been resolved.\n\nArticles will look for a plausible reason, latch onto it, and feed it to you as if it's obvious. The above should make it abundantly clear that there was **no** consensus or transparency into why lumber evaporated for months on end.\n\nWhile sawmills were working at \"reduced capacity\", the combined net profits of the five largest publicly traded North American lumber producers (Canfor in British Columbia; Interfor in British Columbia; Resolute Forest Products in Montreal; West Fraser Timber in British Columbia; and Seattle-based Weyerhaeuser) somehow... [jumped a staggering 2,218%](https://fortune.com/2021/11/18/sawmill-profits-soared-bursting-lumber-bubble-bringing-them-back-down/#:~:text=For%20the%20third%20quarter%20of,down%2069%25%20to%20%241.1%20billion.).
