  "selftext": "So a stock I invested in got delisted last year. They went private on purpose. It is an Irish based (but actually mostly US) company called Mainstay Medical. If all goes well they'll most likely go public again at some point in the future, most likely with a US listing.\n\nNow my EU based broker (DeGiro) kept the stock listed in my account for the shares I own (worth a couple of thousand euro's when i bought them), but the worth was set to zero and it was marked non-tradeable. I was told by customer service the line was still in my account because \"our custodian still keeps the record of stockholders\".\n\nNow fast forward 15 months and they removed the line from my account today. So basically I now feel pretty vulnerable and like I need to make sure my ownership of the shares can still be proven and remains intact. Of course I sent my broker an e-mail already and waiting for a response, but I would appreciate some more input. I'm pretty sure my broker can basically tell me to figure it out myself now, because they have nothing to do with this company anymore. \n\nSo my question is, does anybody have experience in this field and know the proper course of action for me? There is lots of info on Google about stock delistings, but I find nothing about how to assert your rights when you're all of a sudden a private shareholder. Who even keeps the record or knows who owns which shares at this point? I guess I can simply contact the company myself, but I would like to know what I need from them and what to expect from them before I do that.\n\nEDIT: To be clear. This company delisted but left all the shareholders intact. The shares were not bought back to then go private and the company didn't go bust.\n\n**EDIT2: Here is the press release from when the delisting was finalized**\n\n*In accordance with the terms of the Scheme, ordinary shareholders of Mainstay Medical International plc ('Mainstay') at 6.00 p.m. on Thursday, 4 June 2020 will be issued with one Mainstay Holdings Share for every Mainstay plc Share held at such time. Shareholders who held their Mainstay plc Shares in uncertificated form will have their CREST accounts credited with their entitlement to Mainstay Holdings Shares on Monday, 8 June 2020.*\n\n*Shareholders who held their Mainstay plc Shares in certificated form will be issued with share\ncertificates in respect of their Mainstay Holdings Shares in June 2020.*\n\n*Shareholders are advised that all instructions, mandates, elections, communication preferences and group requirements relating to notices and other communications in respect of ordinary shares in effect on 5 June 2020 will, unless and until varied or revoked, be deemed to be valid and effective mandates or instructions to Mainstay Holdings in relation to the corresponding holding of Mainstay Holdings Shares.*\n\n*Cancellation of listing of Mainstay plc Shares*\n\n*The Mainstay plc Shares will be delisted from trading on Euronext Paris and the Euronext Growth market of Euronext Dublin with effect from 7.00 a.m. on 8 June 2020. Mainstay plc Shares in uncertificated form have been disabled in CREST.*\n\n**EDIT3:** I guess I'm getting some clues from the press release myself as I posted it. I just found that \"CREST is the central securities depository and settlement system for the UK and Ireland.\" I'm assuming I had uncertified shares, held at CREST on behalf of me (in nominee) in the name of my broker DeGiro. So I guess I need to start there and ask for these shares to be put in my name somehow.",
