At the start she was watching videos on Youtube from guys like the Rich Dad Poor Dad fellow, and whenever I&#39;d ask questions about why she trusted these people the answer was something along the lines of &quot;I just do.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Now, the way she talks about it, and the tone she takes when I question how good it is as an investment vehicle is genuinely a bit concerning to me. It feels almost like a conversation with a cultist or one of those MLM pushers, where they seem so certain they&#39;re going to make money and push back on or dismiss basically any suggestion that it&#39;s risky at all, which as far as I&#39;m aware, it is.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that so many crypto-enthusiasts behave like this too, and while I am a bit on the fence about whether or not I want to buy some crypto, this cultist behavior is unsettling to me and pushes me further into the camp of not buying.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never seen this kind of attitude from anyone other than cultists and MLM pushers yet it seems so prevalent in crypto and because of that I feel really uncomfortable buying into it even though I don&#39;t see that many other downsides. Can someone with more knowledge on this market explain this to me a little? The amount of hype a lot of these crypto guys seem to have just screams &quot;too good to be true&quot; to me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
