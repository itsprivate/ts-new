So, at the current quote of slightly above $350, their market cap is $44 Billion</li>\n<li><p>2020 revenue was $1.778 Billion, up 57.5 % over 2019  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Player (hardware) revenue was $510 M, up 31.6 % YoY (good number)</li>\n<li>Platform revenue was $1.27 B, up 71.1 % YoY (excellent number)</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Gross margins were 45.45% up 158 basis points YoY  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Player (HW) margins were 8.55% up 414 bps YoY</li>\n<li>Platform (SW) margins were 60.3% down 413 bps YoY</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Number of shares were up 7.6 % YoY</p></li>\n<li><p>Op-ex was up 47.9 % (S&amp;M 67 %, G&amp;A 48.8 %, R&amp;D 34.25 %), all YoY</p></li>\n<li><p>They do not use much leverage, current portion of LTD is below $100M</p></li>\n<li><p>Cash position of a little over a billion dollars</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So,  &quot;player&quot; is their foot in the door, but &quot;platform&quot; is where they make  money. Most of ROKU&#39;s platforms are not in the premium segment, but  found in the value Smart TV segment</p>\n\n<p>ROKU&#39;s  current market share is a tad shy of 10% of the ~300M Smart TVs sold in  2020, and ROKU claims a 33% market share in the USA</p>\n\n<p><em>I got into this wanting to trash ROKU. Instead, I &quot;see&quot; what they are accomplishing,</em> <strong><em>with the exception of earning money (net income)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Valuation Method: Look at HW and SW separately</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A $510M HW company with a 32 % growth rate, and 8.5% gross margins. Hard to value at over 2x sales. So, let&#39;s call it $1 Billion</li>\n<li>A  $1.27 Billion SW company with 60% gross margins, and a 71% growth rate.  This is harder to put a firm number on, but anywhere from 10x to 20x  sales. So, $12.7 B to $25 B</li>\n<li>Add them up, and I get a range of $14 B to $26 B, or a stock price between $113 to $209</li>\n<li>For reference, Morningstar&#39;s FVE estimate is $150 with a high degree of uncertainty</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion: ROKU is seriously overvalued at the current &quot;depressed&quot; quote of $350+/share.</strong> <em>My valuation metrics are &quot;more than generous&quot;.</em> <strong><em>This is not financial advice</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000156459021009021/roku-10k_20201231.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000156459021009021/roku-10k_20201231.htm</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
