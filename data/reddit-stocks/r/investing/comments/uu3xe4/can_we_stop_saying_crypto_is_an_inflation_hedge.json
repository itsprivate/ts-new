Since its last high in November, BTC’s dropped nearly 60%. Even the folks at Bank of America are saying this:\n\n“Instead, Bitcoin trades as a risk asset, and has since July 2021, said BofA analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss in the report, pointing to data showing that the cryptocurrency often moves with the stock market.\n\nOn Jan. 31, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 hit an all-time high based on their movement over the previous 180 days. Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 was also near all-time highs.“\n\nWhen BTC’s been hit harder in recent weeks than the S&amp;P 500, is it really a hedge for anything? I think the crypto bros are going to have to face reality at some point.\n\nWe’re headed into a period of stagflation now and gold/gold stocks are looking like potential winners in this environment. Junior mining exploration stocks have been overlooked for the past couple of years, especially in Canada, with investors swarming into cannabis and when that failed, crypto and ETFs.\n\n# Stagflation is back\n\nFinancial media has been harping on stagflation for the past couple of weeks. We have a consensus among experts that we are in a period of low growth, high inflation that’s here to stay.\n\nFrom Forbes:\n\n“Now, stagflation is again on the cards. After the double shock of COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation rates have exceeded expectations, surging to the highest levels in decades in many countries, while economic growth forecasts are rapidly deteriorating.\n\nThe prospect of stagflation’s return strikes fear into policymakers because there are few monetary tools to address it. Raising interest rates may help reduce inflation, but increased borrowing costs would further depress growth. Keeping monetary policies loose, meanwhile, risks pushing prices higher.”\n\nGold did really well back in the 70s era of stagflation, helping to give the asset its reputation.\n\n# Gold stocks are the way to go:\n\nAs I said earlier, I’m looking at gold and in particular, junior gold exploration stocks. This sector has been overlooked for years and with growing long term demand for gold, I think it will see increasing activity as miners scramble to take advantage of said demand.\n\nThe charts seem to support this, with ZJG finally breaking out of a bear pattern that started last August.\n\nI’m looking at a few stocks at the moment, from producing gold miners to exploration mining companies:\n\n# Barrick Gold (TSX:ABX)(NYSE:GOLD)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the world’s largest gold producers, I like that their strategy has been to focus on large mines with lots of existing resources, meaning that they will be able produce gold at a stable rate. I read that they’ll be producing at least 5.5 million ounces of gold per year up to the end of the decade. Good stable dividend producing stock that will be able to take advantage of the macro-environment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE: AEM) (TSX: AEM)\n\n# \n\nAnother producer, Agnico Eagle has a number of operating mines as well as a host of exploration properties around the world. The company advertises itself as providing investors with a mix of growth and value, its Q1 results last month reported quarterly production of approximately 660,600 ounces of gold. They are forecasting that its production will grow 30% by 2030.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Dynasty Gold Corp DYG:TSX-V DGDCF:US\n\nA pure exploration stock, I ran into DYG after reviewing Agnico Eagle. DYG is exploring and developing 2 projects, the Thundercloud Project in Ontario and the Golden Repeat project in Nevada.\n\nThe Thundercloud Project is interesting because it is near Agnico’s Hammond Reef project and it already has 182,000 ounces of inferred gold in its recent resource report from historical data. Another 15 drill holes of historical data was just announced earlier this month and DYG’s 2022 exploration plans will be focused on building up the resource on the project. They just bought the project from Teck for approximately $100k, which is like they acquired 182,000 ounces of gold for $0.50 per ounce.\n\nFor folks new to exploration mining stocks, these stocks typically have 2 paths for growing shareholder value: increase tonnage of the existing resource, and test drill a new mineralized zone. DYG appears to be doing both.\n\nAnother interesting thing about DYG, they’ve got a lawsuit pending for the appropriation of their old asset in China. The loss of the asset is already priced into the stock but shareholders can benefit from the potential payout of the lawsuit.\n\nTrading at around 15-17 cents recently, DYG is worth a second look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice or recommendations to purchase any stocks.",
