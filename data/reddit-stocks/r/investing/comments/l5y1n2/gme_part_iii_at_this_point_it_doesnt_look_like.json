You guessed it. </p>\n\n<p>On the flipside, this thing can either go up to $1,000 or down to $100 by Friday, as options expire on Friday. Do hedge funds have a trick up their sleeves? </p>\n\n<p>IMO, after this fiasco, federal regulators will need a scapegoat to blame, and do something to regulate this. People in power hate looking foolish. This will be interesting in the next couple of weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Like GameStop Says, &quot;Power to the People&quot;. How ironic.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
