In the very beginning I used to heavily invest in stocks that were Dividend Aristocrats. But I started asking questions such as, how are these stocks performing compared to their peers. Are there stocks with better performing ROEs? What level of risk (sharpe ratio) was taken to achieve those earnings? What is the forecasted earnings growth over the next 5 years? How many consecutive years have they increased dividends? What's their payout ratio? What are analysts thinking? Are there sectors/industries I'm overinvested or underinvested in?\n\nSo I decided to write some programs to pull free financial data from multiple sources, such as Yahoo Finance!, YCharts, Finviz, Vanguard, Wikipedia, and other sources. I consolidate all of these different data sources, cleanse and standardize the data, and came up with my own scoring metric on how to rank each stock. The metrics I use for calculating my score include metrics such as Current Dividend Yield, 5-yr Forecasted Earnings Growth, ROE, Payout Ratio, Sharpe Ratio, Dividend List Membership (Aristocrats, Champions, Kings, etc.) and heavily favors stocks with strong histories of paying quality dividends. I try not to give any one metric too much weight.\n\nPasted below is a link to a screenshot that ranks the top 5 stocks for each sector.\n\n[Stock Investment Assessment](https://i.redd.it/1q2ykuir2r091.png)\n\nTo get the full stock list. Please see my other post: [Full Stock List](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/uued7d/my_complete_list_of_stocks_and_their_rankings_by/)\n\nWhat are your thoughts on my top rankings? Any surprises? Any questions on any particular metric? Hopefully it has provided you with extra investment insight.\n\nData Disclaimer: Data from free, publicly available sources are known to have data inaccuracy issues and financial metrics/forecasts are constantly changing everyday, so please independently verify any metric you use when making investment decisions.
