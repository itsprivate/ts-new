Situated in southeastern Ecuador, in the same belt as the Fruta del Norte and Mirador mines, adjacent to the +1Bt San Carlos-Panantza copper deposits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-</strong> Tamarugo is an undrilled, grassroots copper porphyry exploration target in the Chilean copper belt that hosts the largest deposits in the world. The project represents the first test of David Lowell’s vision of the future of copper porphyry exploration: blind targets. Solaris can earn up to 75% from Freeport-McMoRan with US$5M / 5 years of spending.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-</strong> Ricardo is a brownfields copper porphyry exploration project immediately contiguous and on the same structure as Chuquicamata, one of the largest copper mines in Chile. Freeport-McMoRan is earning up to an 80% interest in the project via US$130M / 5 years of exploration spending.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Stock information:(As at 31.12.2020)</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Common Shares Outstanding         105.0M</p>\n\n<p>Stock Options              8.0M</p>\n\n<p>EQX-linked Warrants1                               4.4M / $25M</p>\n\n<p>Solaris Warrants             41.1M / $90M<br/>\nRestricted Share Units                0.5M</p>\n\n<p>Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding     159.2M  </p>\n\n<p>Cash                $93M</p>\n\n<p>1Solaris issues 0.25 Solaris common share for each full share of Equinox Gold Corp. upon exercise of Equinox Warrants, and receives 1/10th of the cash proceeds payable to Equinox Gold Corp. when such warrants are exercised. See EQX Financial Statements for full warrant pricing details.<br/>\n<strong>Who are Equinox Gold Shareholders?</strong><br/>\nSolaris was formed in August 2018 as a spin-out of Equinox Gold Corp.’s copper assets (formerly known as Solaris Copper Inc.). Sixty percent of the shares were distributed to Equinox Gold shareholders, who received 1/10th of a Solaris share for every EQX share held, with the remaining shares held by Equinox Gold as a long-term supportive shareholder. Equinox warrants, options and restricted share units were also adjusted pursuant to the arrangement. If your Equinox Gold shares were deposited electronically in an online account before August 2, 2018, you won’t need to do anything to receive your Solaris shares. The conversion would have happened automatically and the shares will appear in your account. Solaris is publicly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “TSX: SLS” and on the OTCQB Venture Market under the symbol “SLSSF”.  </p>\n\n<p>Read full  company presentation here: <a href=\"https://www.solarisresources.com/\">https://www.solarisresources.com/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
