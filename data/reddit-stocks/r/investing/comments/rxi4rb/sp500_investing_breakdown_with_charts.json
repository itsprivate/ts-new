You are pretty (\\*\\*extremely\\*\\*) sure it’s going down. Here is some information you might want to know before you take that bet.\n\nIn each 10-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher one day ten is 62%.\n\n**But… the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 88.82%. Let’s dig deeper. (**Data source: [Tradewell](https://tradewell.app))\n\nChart: [https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO](https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO) (Source: Tradewell)\n\nThe chart above shows every single 10-day return period for the S&amp;P500 ETF, the $SPY, since its inception.\n\nThe blue lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY closed higher at least once.\n\nThe red lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY did \\*not\\* close higher at least once, ie. T\\[0\\] was the highest price the $SPY traded over the next 10 days.\n\nIf it’s not already obvious there are **a lot** bluer lines than there are red lines. In each of the charts shown below the red lines will depict price paths that did not close higher at least once.\n\nThe same applies on a 15 and 20 day-timeframes:\n\n* \\- In each 15-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 15 is 64% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 91.53%.\n* \\- In each 20-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 20 is 65% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 93%.\n\nChart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT](https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT) (Source: Tradewell)\n\nAnd how about in a 60-day period. Historically, 97% of the time the SPY has closed higher at least once over the next 60 trading days. \\*\\*Incredible\\*\\*.\n\nChart: [https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY](https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY) (Source: Tradewell)\n\nSo, what are the obvious and not-so obvious takeaways from this:\n\n1. The S&amp;P500 has a natural upside drift on virtually every time frame the SPY has well over a 50% chance of closing higher than where it started.\n2. The price path the SPY takes to its destination has a lot of new highs from the starting point. In each of the 10, 15, 20 and 60 day timeframes the $SPY has historically had a probability of closing higher at least once 89%, 92%, 93%, and 97% of the time respectively.\n\nSee [https://imgur.com/a/GviG5El](https://imgur.com/a/GviG5El)",
