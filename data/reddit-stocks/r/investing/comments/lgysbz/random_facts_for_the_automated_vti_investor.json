Using Yahoo Finance historical data for VTI over the past 5 years, I ended up answering this question plus diving deeper to make a few other random observations. Here is what I found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What day of the week is best to buy VTI?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thursday</strong>, hands down</li>\n<li>Data for average delta of opening vs previous trading day close:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mon: +0.056016</li>\n<li>Tues: +0.228716</li>\n<li>Wed: +0.114864</li>\n<li>Thurs: -0.05267</li>\n<li>Fri: +0.071502</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Does the day of the week matter over a long period of time?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Basically <strong>no</strong> -- but if you&#39;re going to pick a day for auto-investing, you might as well pick Thurs</li>\n<li>I setup my spreadsheet to show the total gains of auto-investing $100/week on a given day. I did not factor in closed trading days + that M1 Finance auto-invest on the next open trading day.  So certain days (Mondays particularly) had significantly less buys than Tues/Wed.</li>\n<li>Data for average portfolio size of auto-investing in VTI:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mon: 236 buys, cost-basis $23.6k, current value $35.7k, gain 51.22%</li>\n<li>Tues: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $38.9k, gain 51.33%</li>\n<li>Wed: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $39.0k, gain 51.96%</li>\n<li>Thurs: 255 buys, cost-basis $25.5k, current value $38.7k, gain 51.93%</li>\n<li>Fri: 253 buys, cost-basis $25.3k, current value $38.4k, gain +51.83%</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>What day of the week saw best overall gains?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Still <strong>Tuesdays</strong></li>\n<li>Data for average delta of closing vs previous trading day close:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mon: +0.076398</li>\n<li>Tues: +0.160039</li>\n<li>Wed: +0.13786</li>\n<li>Thurs: +0.00851</li>\n<li>Fri: +0.061344</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If you compare this data vs the data from bullet #1, we see a few interesting facts:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mon, Wed, and Thurs will close higher than opening</li>\n<li>Tues and Fri we see some profit taking and close slightly lower than opening</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>What would happen if you just invested the $25.7k from bullet #2 in lump sum at the beginning of the 5 year period?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Value of your VTI portfolio would be about <strong>$60.5k</strong> right now (or about 55% more)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Lastly... What would happen if you invested in yearly lump sums at the &#39;worst possible day of the year&#39; (simulating the most unlucky investor ever)?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I divided the $25.7k into 5 parts and invested $5140 on the worst day of 2016, 17, 18, 19 and 20. The choices of &#39;worst day&#39; was completely subjective based on eye balling charts when VTI would dip over subsequent days/weeks.</li>\n<li>Dates chosen:\n\n<ul>\n<li>2016 - June 8</li>\n<li>2017 - March 1</li>\n<li>2018 - Sept 20</li>\n<li>2019 - May 3</li>\n<li>2020 - Feb 10</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Final account value was <strong>$38.6k</strong>, or roughly the same as weekly auto-investing $100.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT: Typo on the lump sum bullet. Previously said today&#39;s portfolio value would be $56.2k. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
