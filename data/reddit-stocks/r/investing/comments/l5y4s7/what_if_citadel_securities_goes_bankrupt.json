And they are absolutely obliterating them.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why they bailed out Melvin, because it’s their problem anyways. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, I believe we have uncovered is that the Citadel fund and Citadel Securities - both of which are owned by the same Griffin guy - only have (had) about $35-$40B of assets to their name collectively.</p>\n\n<p>They’ve already had to bailout Melvin to the tune of $2B. And that was at GME $150.  </p>\n\n<p>That’s pretty wild considering CS’ total “record” revenue in 2020 was 6B.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also learned that short interest in GME is INCREASING, and this may not let up.</p>\n\n<p>So what if GME actually goes above $500? That might sound crazy, but that’s a move from like  $15B market cap to $35B market cap? We all know that’s actually possible in this market.</p>\n\n<p>What if the short squeeze mania spills out into the other heavily shorted stocks?</p>\n\n<p>Pretty concerning for CS because, I’ve also learned that Citadel Securities is responsible for processing about 25%-40% of ALL stock market transactions.</p>\n\n<p>So uh. What if they go bankrupt?</p>\n\n<p>I don’t mean to be speaking in extremes, but is this potentially a 2008 mortgage backed securities crisis type of situation?</p>\n\n<p>Serious educated answers would be sincerely appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
