Why? Because it&#39;s the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of *potential* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why This is Important for Currency Markets &amp; The RMB</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you watch this, you&#39;ll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.</p>\n\n<p>In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the &quot;there is no alternative&quot; effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
