Ecommerce group Alibaba dropped as much as 5.4 per cent and internet group Tencent lost as much as 3.3 per cent.\n\nDidi launched its $4.4bn New York initial public offering in June, making it the biggest listing by a Chinese company in the US since Alibaba in 2014. Days later, Chinese regulators ordered Didi’s app to be taken off domestic app stores. The company was also banned from signing up new users and subjected to a wide-ranging government investigation into its cyber security practices.\n\nThe group’s shares have tumbled from the June IPO price of $14 to $7.80 at the New York close on Thursday. They initially rose in pre-market trading on Friday, but later gave up those gains.\n\nWhile big Chinese state-owned enterprises listed in the US have been targeted by the Biden and Trump administrations with investment bans, New York remained an attractive destination for China’s private-sector tech champions.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Didi’s IPO, Chinese regulators signalled that other companies hoping to follow in its wake would be subject to more stringent approval procedures, especially if they managed data deemed sensitive by Beijing.",
