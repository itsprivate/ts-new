Why are so many people proponents of giving up the extra compund growth from reinvested dividends? </p>\n\n<p>I understand the appeal of having &quot;passive income&quot; but to me it seems like stealing money from your future self. Unless I have a gross concept error on what living off dividends really entails, I can&#39;t help but think people are too enamored with &quot;free money&quot; to consider the gains they are giving up as a consequence.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: My question stemmed from a concern that dividends were being portrayed as a form of passive income before retirement, I understand that once you are no longer working you have to have a way to continue to support yourself and your family. Nowadays there is so much hype about trying to find more ways to make money outside of your a job, and personally I think that while you&#39;re still working dividends should be considered passive investing (kind of like 401k matching) rather than passive &quot;income&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>So a better and slightly different question is, why do so many people like the idea of having 100% of living expenses covered by dividends? It almost seems like it contradicts the idea of having a diversified portfolio. Would it not be better to withdraw a set amount from a diversified portfolio rather than relying solely on dividends?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
