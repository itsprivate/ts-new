Verticalnet, for example, IPOd with $3.6 Million in quarterly revenue, rising rapidly to $25 Million in quarterly revenue by 2000. This sent the stock price soaring, reaching a market cap of over $10 Billion. They even received \nan investment from Microsoft.\n\nWhat was the fate of this company that was delivering consistent revenue growth, in an industry that was projected to grow immensely? \n\nIf you invested right after the IPO when the valuation was $1.6 Billion, you would've seen your investment go up by 500%, or 6x, in roughly a year. Amazing, right? Well, suppose you continued to hold.\n\n&gt;In 2008, Bravo Solutions acquired Verticalnet for $15.2 million.\n\nEven after all those gains, you would've lost 99% of your initial investment over 9 years.\n\nLook throughout the list, lots of companies are the same story. Companies reaches obscene valuation, later gets bought out for pennies on the dollar of what people paid. Lots of fast growing companies trading at many times revenues that provided terrible ROI.\n\nBut what about quality blue chip companies like Nvidia? They are profitable, and aren't going anywhere and will grow with AI and Metaverse, right?\n\nCisco was THE blue chip of the time to be invested in. Just as Nvidia is Powering the supposed AI and Metaverse boom, Cisco's networking equipment was powering the internet boom.\n\nLike Nvidia, Cisco was a profitable company with good margins, so they seemed like a safe investment. \n\nHowever, if you invested in Cisco at the peak of $80/share, you would've lost more than 80% of your investment in the ensuing crash. If you held until today(2021), you'd still be down 30%, before dividends.\n\nThe takeaway here is that just because a company has grown consistently over the past few years does NOT mean they will continue to grow at that rate. Once a company gets big, competitors arise. Eventually the company captures the size of the market for their product, and growth slows considerably if they fail to continue to innovate in new areas.\n\nRoblox, for example, is already played by over half of US kids. Where is the growth from here? The stock is trading at 35x revenues and is unprofitable. We also know consumer trends change quickly. What happens if the next generation of kids play something other than Roblox? This is a risk that isn't even priced in.\n\nBut what's the bull case? How do they possibly expand such that they produce a ROI to shareholders at current prices?\n\nWhile things still aren't quite as extreme as the tech bubble was, the same principles still apply.\n\nIf you invest in any stock, you need to ask yourself \"Am I comfortable holding those for 30 years if the price tanks, only collecting dividends?\". If the answer is no, you shouldn't buy it. If you're depending on the next guy to also pay 35x revenue to buy your growth stock, you're speculating.",
