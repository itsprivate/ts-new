The contract was for a base year and three option years, and Palantir was awarded $110 million at the time for the base year.</p>\n\n<p>In the last year, Army Vantage has helped leaders make data-driven decisions in the fight against Covid-19.</p>\n\n<p>The second contract is a two-year deal worth up to $31.5 million with the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) to provide a software platform for secure, reliable and timely processing of data to enable NHS decision-makers to best plan the use of resources and improve patient care.</p>\n\n<p>NHS personnel will use Palantir&#39;s software to understand how Covid-19 is spreading, identify risks to particularly vulnerable populations, proactively increase health and care resources in emerging hot spots, ensure critical equipment is supplied to the facilities with the greatest need and divert patients and service users to the facilities that are best able to care for them.</p>\n\n<p>The NHS will also use Palantir as part of its planning and operational roll-out of the U.K.’s vaccine program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
