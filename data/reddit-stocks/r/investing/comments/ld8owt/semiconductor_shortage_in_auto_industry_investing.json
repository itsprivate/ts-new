I work in corporate for a major automaker and it has been big news during our global town halls. </p>\n\n<p>It seems like the semiconductor companies are focused more on other industries, like gaming, phones, etc. rather than the auto companies, which is why there&#39;s a shortage in this area. I&#39;ve been trying to find which semiconductor companies are leading for the automotive sector. Are there any that you guys might have your eye on, which could ramp up production in the auto sector or sell for a higher price point to automakers due to the shortage? </p>\n\n<p>Seems like a good buying opportunity in this space. I&#39;m already looking into buying AMD and MU.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
