On a monthly basis, the index increased 1.5% between November and December.\n\nMeanwhile, the Case-Shiller national home price index demonstrated 18.8% growth between 2020 and 2021 in December, in line with November’s reading.\n\n“This is the highest calendar year increase in 34 years of data, and\nsubstantially ahead of 2020’s 10.4% gain,” Craig J. Lazzara, managing director at S&amp;P DJI, said in the Case-Shiller report.\n\n\nWhat happened: Phoenix recorded the highest rate of home-price growth in the country in December, according to the Case-Shiller report, with a 32.5% year-over-year increase. As with the month prior, two Florida cities closely followed: Tampa with a 29.4% gain and Miami with a 27.3% rise.\n\nThe FHFA report showed that home-price growth during the fourth quarter of 2021 was strongest in Arizona, Utah and Idaho, and weakest in the District of Columbia, Louisiana and North Dakota. That report recorded the highest pace of home-price appreciation in Cape Coral-Ft. Myers, Fla., where prices rose 34.6% on an annual basis.\n\nLooking ahead: “Home prices continued to surpass expectations in December, but a marked change may be ahead for growth as rising mortgage rates eat into homebuyer purchasing power,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.\n\n“While typical asking prices continue to accelerate, the pace of median sales price growth has slowed, signaling a potential gap between what buyers are willing and able to pay and what sellers are hoping to net,” she added.\n\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-s-p-case-shiller-and-fhfa-home-price-indexes-11645537850",
