  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>AIM ImmunoTech, Inc. operates as a biopharmaceutical company, which  engages in the clinical development of new drug therapies based on  natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of viral  and immune based disorders. Its products include Alferon N Injection and  Ampligen. The Alferon N Injection is a purified, natural source,  glycosylated, multispecies alpha interferon product, composed of eight  forms of high-purified alpha interferon. The Ampligen is used in the  treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and as a vaccine enhancer for  therapeutic and/or preventative development related to influenza and  cancer treatments.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why I&#39;m bullish on this company NOW is because they have extremely recently released news that makes their immediate future look extremely optimistic. For one, they announced last Friday (Feb. 5th) that they had been able to secure funding for their new nasal-applied COVID therapy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/aim-immunotech-completes-closes-atm-115000689.html\">https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/aim-immunotech-completes-closes-atm-115000689.html</a></p>\n\n<p>With that news alone the requirements are made for both TD Securities and Maxim Group&#39;s price target of 5.5 - 6.5$ are met and the immediate future of the company would look bright given the company&#39;s robust financial past and ability to have drugs successfully pass the human clinical stage.</p>\n\n<p>However, that&#39;s not all. As of this morning the European Union has granted the Orphan Drug Designation for Rintatolimod which is a drug used in treatment for pancreatic cancer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/committee-report/comp-meeting-report-review-applications-orphan-designation-january-2021_en.pdf\">https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/committee-report/comp-meeting-report-review-applications-orphan-designation-january-2021_en.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Once the company PR&#39;s this news I expect that the price will gain significantly and my own personally Price Target for the company might be as high as 10$.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial professional and this is not financial advice. I just like this stock and see good growth potential in an undervalued company.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Position: 72821 shares @ 2.63$.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: Typos</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Added my position.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
