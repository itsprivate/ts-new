Yes and no.\n\nFirst, let's look at a fund that focuses primarily on buying companies that have had an announcement regarding their acquisition. \n\n IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA)\n\nThis ETF has returned 2.68% annualized over the last ten years and 2.49% since inception. If you exclude fees and assume you do this yourself, over the last ten years it has done 3.56% annualized.\n\nIs this free money? If you consider anything with a positive return to be free money, then yes. However I should remind you the S&amp;P 500 has done around 14% annualized over the same time period.\n\nThe strategy fails for the same reason the martingale roulette strategy fails. You make very little money with each 'success' and your failures eat many 'successes' given how large the drawdowns are when mergers get cancelled. When mergers get cancelled they almost always immediately lose whatever premium they received from the merger announcement. From personal experience, these companies rarely perform well after a failed merger as well.\n\nHope that helps.",
