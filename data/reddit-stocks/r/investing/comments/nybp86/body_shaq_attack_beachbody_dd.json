Shaq, Lebron, and Arnold are all shareholders. Sounds meme-y, I know. The financials are solid here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick Financial Overview:</strong> 1.1B (est) revenue for 2021, 68% gross margins on that rev (which is better than NFLX, DIS, PTON, etc). Digital subscriptions have 89% margins. 43% YoY revenue increase for Q1. Added literally a million subscribers YoY. 400M free cash on the books upon merger w/ no debt. Also expanding to 10+ countries in the future. Growth company imo. Connected at home fitness will disrupt the gym industry, again imo.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PTON Comparison</strong></p>\n\n<p>A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer. I&#39;m thinking about this like a caveman in that I believe people who want to be involved in this type of fitness will first look for the cheapest option. I mean who gets more foot traffic, Walmart or Whole Foods? I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I&#39;ve seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. I will say PTON has a cult following, and the affluent type will probably not settle for less. Here are some price comparisons of starting prices among connected fitness bikes.</p>\n\n<p>NordicTrak - $2k</p>\n\n<p>Proform - $1.5k</p>\n\n<p>SoulCycle - $2.5k</p>\n\n<p>Peloton - $1.8k</p>\n\n<p>MYX - $1.3k</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future of At-Home Connected Fitness</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005351/en/The-Future-of-Fitness-Americans-Embrace-a-Hybrid-of-Home-Exercise-and-Gym-Workouts\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/home-workouts-future-of-fitness\">here</a>. A survey of 3500 American by <em>The New Consumer</em> and Coefficient Capital found that 76% of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic—and crucially, 66% prefer it. Among millennials, the number is even higher: 82% made the switch and 81% like it more. Link to article <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90587575/gyms-arent-coming-back-heres-how-youll-work-out-in-the-future\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tech in Fitness</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2021 Q1 Financials</strong></p>\n\n<p>Total Revenue: $243M - 43% increase YoY</p>\n\n<p>Total Subscriptions: 3.2M - 39% increase (record high)</p>\n\n<p>(Not an actual earnings report, assumed to be released after merger)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future Plans &amp; News</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here’s where they’re really making moves. Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they’ll have what they referred to as a “war chest” of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&amp;A, marketing, and expansion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>International Expansion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The team has recently stated plans of expanding to 10 countries in the near future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BeachBody on Demand Interactive (BODi)</strong></p>\n\n<p>BeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD’s and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article <a href=\"https://tbc-cms-prod-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tbc-cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19060123/BODi-Press-Release.pdf\">here. </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>OpenFit PartnerShips</strong></p>\n\n<p>OpenFit (backed by Lebron &amp; Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005208/en/Openfit-and-Concierge-Health-Announce-At-Home-Exercise-Incentives\">here. </a></p>\n\n<p>OpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness, giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html\">here.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Meme Potential</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hate me or love me for this aspect</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$BODY ticker (hard to ignore) <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html\">This</a> article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without. Or something like that.</li>\n<li>Comparison to PTON</li>\n<li>Arnold, Lebron, and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/561655635\">Here </a>is a message from Shaq to shareholders, hilariously scripted but hey it’s Shaq</li>\n<li>Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both former Disney execs, will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth, post-merge. Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney+, also former TikTok CEO</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I assume that once the merger is complete, these three will be able to participate in PR and marketing for the company. The team has stated that there are certain SEC rules against this until the transaction is complete.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bear Case - MLM</strong></p>\n\n<p>BeachBody has been accused of being a Multi-Level Marketing Scheme. While it is true that BB coaches are incentivized to bring on other coaches and sell Shakeology, it is not mandatory. In fact, employees and coaches are not allowed to have products on hand (shakeology) which is typical of a true MLM. Because of this, it’s a non-issue to me. I don’t find this company to be unethical, as they have truly helped people to change their lives in a positive way. Plus, I’m a believer in personal responsibility. As stated previously, coaches CANNOT have product on hand, and become coaches on their own free will. You can become a coach and never sell a single product or bring on another coach. No gun-to-the-head style sales tactics. If anything, it’s more closely related to affiliate marketing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\n\n<p>All in all, this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion (in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33% by 2027, $59B) which happens to have a few meme-like qualities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> Cheapest bike, home workouts here to stay, tech good, Shaq, meme</p>\n\n<p>Not a financial advisor, not financial advice</p>\n\n<p>Positions: 259 $20C Feb, 33 $17.5C Feb</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
