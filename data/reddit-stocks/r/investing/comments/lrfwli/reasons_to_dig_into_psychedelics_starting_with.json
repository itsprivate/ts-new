Make sure to always do your own Due Diligence when it comes to investing, but stay watching because shrooms are trending everywhere right now.</p>\n\n<p>Field Trip will be one of the dominant players in the sector. They have all the boxes checked off for me, and for that, I am in this for the long run! Looking forward to growing with the company in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TDLR: Shrooms are taking over the world, invest in shrooms.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ticker Info...</p>\n\n<p><strong>US OTC =</strong> $FTRPF</p>\n\n<p><strong>CAD =</strong> $FTRP</p>\n\n<p><strong>WARRANTS =</strong> $FTRP.wt</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
