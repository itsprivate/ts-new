We sold half an acre way in very back, in 1998, to some random company that is still around today for $120k. That’s it. Half is currently leased for 18 months for $8,000/month to a random freighter company. No other sales, we’ve certainly had lots of offers...lowball however. We actually got an offer yesterday for $1.7 million, no thanks! \n-\nAnyways, We just received an offer for 1.5 acre for the “best spot” on the land (road frontage, major intersection, 25,000+ traffic) for $412,500 for 1.5 acre—This is a very popular restaurant that will generate tons of traffic into our land. Thing is, they bought .89 acre 2 years ago for $500k in nearby city, and another for $485k in another location. Smaller land, more $$. \n-\nThey tell us once the deal is finalized they are bringing onboard another companion restaurant to go in beside them. We know who it is-I’ve contacted them and they said they are very interested in an acre too. They are actually side-by-side at the other locations, so we know it isn’t all bullsh*t. And his ‘companion’ always pays more for land than what he did. \n-\nOur thoughts are, we know they can afford a little more, but being more “accommodating” to him, he can pull in several other businesses to come join, where we could then make up for the money left on the table. And we’ve had ZERO movement on our land and we simply feel it’s just time to get something going. What do you all think?",
