You heard me right, savings bonds, [specifically Series I savings bonds which pay interest linked directly to the current inflation rate](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm). The interest rate on I-Bonds [right now is 7.12](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm)%! That’s a US government security that pays a multitude higher interest than any bank and more than most blue chip corporate bonds are yielding right now. The interest rate on I Bonds is adjusted to reflect the inflation rate every 6 months. At certain points, the Treasury department will also sell I-bonds that have a second additional fixed interest portion to the I-Bond’s yield, however as of right now this fixed interest portion is set at 0% so any I-bonds bought right now are tied directly to the inflation rate only. [Unlike TIPS securities sold by the Treasury department, the principal of an I-Bond stays fixed (TIPS lose value when deflation occurs). The interest rate on an I-bond will never go below 0% in the event of deflation](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tipsvsibonds.htm). I-Bonds can be purchased directly from the US Government via its [TreasuryDirect website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/tdhome.htm).\n\nSo, as with anything on here, the question becomes, what’s the catch? There is in fact a limit on the amount of I-Bonds you can purchase, $10,000 in electronic I-bonds per year can be bought through the government’s treasury direct website. [You can also separately buy up to $5,000 in paper I Bonds by electing on your tax return to receive your tax refund in I-Bonds.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/faq/faq_irstaxfeature.htm) Finally, and most importantly, you must hold I-bonds for at least 1 year prior to being able to cash them in and any I-Bond redeemed prior to 5 years from the date of issue loses the three months of interest preceding the redemption. Unlike some other treasuries, the bonds also cannot be resold to other investors. I do not currently hold any series I Bonds.",
