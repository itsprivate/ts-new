That makes it a great target for a (probably small) short squeeze, even if temporarily.</p>\n\n<p>Before you get too excited and start treating this like a Meme stock, read on about why this is a fantastic investment even without considering Short Interest.</p>\n\n<p>Rocket’s Q4 results COMPLETELY knocked it out of the park with $4.8 billion Adjusted Revenue (up 162% YOY) and $2.3 billion Adjusted Income (up 350% YOY). \n<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-experiences-explosive-growth-210500749.html\">See Yahoo article here</a></p>\n\n<p>Last month, Rocket also announced their new online National Mortgage Broker Directory that allows/assists people to find an in-person mortgage agent to help them purchase their home. It’s an alternative to fill the need of the people who prefer in-person contact over filling out overwhelming checkboxes and blanks online.</p>\n\n<p>They’re also now adding a Special dividend of $1.11/share, announced today with their earnings.</p>\n\n<p>RKT has been trading way under an average PT of $24.68 ($18-$35) by 14 analysts on Yahoo! Finance way before these new earnings results, so it was already trading at a discount.</p>\n\n<p>For the better part of the last 6 months it has traded consistently between $19-$24. It’s primed for a jump even without any of this news.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR- buy RKT. It’s cheap, is massively shorted and has GREAT financials. And a Special dividend. Plus, their name is Rocket</p>\n\n<p>*Edited for formatting</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
