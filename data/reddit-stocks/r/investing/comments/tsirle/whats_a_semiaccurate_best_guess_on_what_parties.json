I can only imagine the complexity of the SPY options chain and won't pretend to understand even a fraction of it. The only question I have is... is it responsible for 90m shares trading a day alone? Probably a not.\n\nI don't think a lot of 401ks or pensions or any other retirement accounts where average Americans dollar-cost-average a portion of their paycheck income/savings end up in SPY. That takes out \"institutional investing\" into SPY, right? If not... what institutions are buying SPY? What product are they offering on top of it, and to who? How large are they? Why wouldn't their customers just buy SPY themselves?\n\nI don't think retail traders/retail day traders/retail swing traders/anything retail are a huge % of the market when speaking about a daily volume perspective. I don't know how big the retail trading market is (on a daily or weekly or monthly scale) but I'd love to learn more. I'm going to guess it's 5-20% of daily volume, being extremely generous. I agree that it's asinine to even think retail is responsible for 20% of daily volume but... I literally can't even estimate/guess/come up with a hypothesis on where the other 95% of the daily volume from SPY comes from. \n\nDo other asset management companies (who aren't big enough to have their own S&amp;P ETF offerings) charge their clients a fee to put their money in SPY for them behind the scenes, and they are daily rebalancing?

But... they can't just trade in between each other all day, can they? Like... there are only so many Robinhood buyers, and all of their volume isn't going to SPY... If \"market makers\" are behind the majority of volume because they are providing liquidity, who are the buyers and sellers on each side? We already determined the majority is not retail, not institutions since they would be targeting mutual funds instead of the ETF.\n\nThe market is open from 9:30am -&gt; 4:00pm (6.5 hours, 23.4k seconds). If you ignore pre-market and after-hours (not sure what % of daily volume these two trading windows are responsible for, I'm going to guess less than 10%), you're talking about roughly 2b shares traded in a 21 day window, roughly 95.2m shares per day, just over 4,070 shares a second. What parties are buying and selling 4k shares a second every second of every trading day on average for the entire year on average?\n\n&gt; According to a 2017 JPMorgan analysis, passive investors like ETFs and quantitative investment accounts, which utilize high-frequency algorithmic trading, were responsible for about 60 percent of overall trading volumes while \"fundamental discretionary traders\" (or traders who evaluate the fundamental factors affecting a stock before making an investment) comprised only 10 percent of the overall figures.
