During the 1999 cycle, companies with no profit, no revenue, and sometimes even no product were receiving massive valuations from going public in the stock market. All you had to do is have an idea and put dot com at the end of your name. \n\nToday, the growth companies look much different. Yes, there's similar froth in the crypto and NFT space, but by growth, I am referring to stocks such as Zoom, Docusign, Teladoc, Paypal etc. All of these companies have massive amounts of revenue with clear paths to profitability in the next 5 years. Some of them are already profitable today and are expanding heavily.\n\nBut beyond this, if you simply look at the state of the market and the numbers, it becomes clear that this is not the same. In the height of the technology bubble, the S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio was 29 with the 10 year yield bonds yielding close to 6-7%. The growth yield on the S&amp;P 500 stocks was close to 3%. Today, the S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio is at 21 with the 10 year yield bond at 1.8%. The growth yield on S&amp;P is closer to 5% today. \n\nIn an environment where bonds are yielding one-third of what they were doing that period, it is not unusual for people to be moving over to equities in order to look for returns. This is especially true in a period when equity growth is already expecting to yield more. \n\nNow, this is not to say that we are not in a bubble.
