We can calculate an intrinsic value for the ETH token using traditional finance valuation models. \n\nYou can find these in the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_r4DVzqWgoP7k0y-YXVdyKfEtpTaY-F6f5s9lc7sBNE/edit?usp=sharing). This spreadsheet is read-only and won't be edited to meet the rules of /r/investing, is provided as is.\n\nHope you enjoy the analysis and motivates an interesting discussion.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe cryptocurrency asset space is largely misunderstood by the market resulting in significant inefficiencies in its valuation. From wild speculative valuations in tokens with no specific purpose, to some very significant undervaluations in others. I think the best way to help the market find the fair value of each asset is by building valuation models that root the value of the token in its fundamentals. The expectation is that armed with better models, market inefficiencies will diminish with time.\n\n**Intended Readership**\n\nThis post can be beneficial to those well-versed in traditional finance and fundamental valuation models that do not understand what cryptocurrencies are and see them as shiny magical tokens with no intrinsic value.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum it can be beneficial to those well-versed in cryptocurrencies; what they are, their use and purpose and understand their utility. But are not necessarily familiar with financial valuation models.\n\nThe large decoupling between these groups of people is probably cause of the severe mispricings occurring in the space. Hopefully this post and the valuation models provided can help bridge the gap between the two.\n\n**Understanding Ethereum**\n\nEthereum is a settlement layer capable of executing smart contracts (small programs), in this regard you could consider it as not too dissimilar in functionality to a payment processor (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, Square...) that is also able to host and execute applications, like a Decentralized App Store. This settlement layer is highly decentralized and secure because it relies on thousands of independent nodes validating all the transactions executed on the network; there is no downtime, the network is censorship resistant, and is not owned by any individual or organization. This is the value proposition of the network, not every use case benefits from these properties but for those that do Ethereum is the leading platform.\n\n**Ethereum Monetary Policy**\n\nTo pay for the security and decentralization the network pays its validators, remunerating them for their work. Additionally, this remuneration serves as an incentive for anyone to join the validation effort, increasing the security and decentralization of the network. This remuneration has 2 sources; newly minted tokens and transaction fees paid by the users of the network. I´m going to provide analogies rooted in traditional finance to help illustrate the parallelisms.\n\n- Newly minted tokens are not too dissimilar to the issuance of new stock. When a company emits new stock existing shareholders dilute themselves (they have a smaller share of the company) and the newly created shares are given as remuneration to a subset of them, for example to employees as part of a stock based compensation program. It´s important to understand that creation of new tokens does not create value out of thin air, as it´s self-diluting. Instead, there is a transfer of value from all token-holders to the validators that receive those newly minted tokens.\n\n- Transaction fees paid by the users of the network can be compared in this analogy to the revenues. When a user wants to settle a transaction on the network it pays for its use. The more transactions and the more valuable the fees of those transactions the more revenue collected by the network. A traditional finance person should immediately understand that if there are cash flows entering the system you can use those to create a valuation model. The throughput of the network is an scarce resource so the price paid for transactions is subject to demand and supply dynamics.\n\nThe revenue of the network (i.e. the transactions fees) is used in one part (around 20%) to remunerate the validators and the rest (around 80%) to reduce the token supply. These percentages are not fixed by the protocol but are instead a result of demand for the available transaction throughput, the values here quoted are the currently observed proportion. The token supply reduction operates in a way not too dissimilar to a stock buyback program, where income of a company is used to reduce the circulating supply of shares. This token supply reduction is commonly  nicknamed \"burning\".\n\n**Monetary Model**\n\nThe network generates revenues. These revenues are used to pay validators for their work and reduce token supply. At the same time the network issues new tokens, that are used as another source of remuneration for the validators. The interplay between the token supply reduction through burning and the token issuance determines if the token supply is deflationary (net token destruction), inflationary (net token creation) or flat (no net change). Thus Ethereum's monetary policy is defined programmatically but is also adaptative to the market, if the price of Ether falls too low for its given revenues it will enter a strong deflationary regime to self-correct the situation. This gives Ethereum a very strong monetary policy (arguably stronger than Bitcoin) and consolidates the token as a store of value as it can be used to calculate a long-term lower bound price of the token. You can see this in detail in the Monetary Model tab.\n\n**Yield Model**\n\nWith the introduction of a burn mechanism Ether became a yielding asset, the burn mechanism results in an effective yield for all token-holders in much the same way a buyback results in shareholder yield for shareholders. Ether becoming a yielding asset will be cemented even further with the transition to Proof of Stake (a.k.a. \"the merge\"). With it, token-holders can become validators of the network and receive also the fee revenue (the other 20% of the network revenues). \n\nYield opens up an entirely new price discovery mechanism. Without yield, the price of a token is purely based in supply and demand (this is the current situation for most cryptocurrencies). We may know the supply ahead of time, as it's defined algorithmically, but demand is fickle and changes on a whim. This results in a lot of volatility, particularly with low market capitalizations and small circulating supplies.\n\nBut yield gives us a comparable across asset classes. All else being equal, money tends to flow to higher yielding assets to extract that yield, in doing so the price of the underlying asset increases reducing the yield. This causes assets to converge relatively quickly to a yield comparable to the rest of asset-classes given certain measure of risk (e.g., volatility, total loss of capital, etc...) and expected growth. If the price of Ether becomes too low for a given value of the network fees, it will result in a very large yield and investors will flock to it to obtain the yield. This allows us to build a yield based valuation model. You can find said model in the Yield Model tab.\n\n**DCF Model**\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow models are the gold standard of valuation. In a Discounted Cash Flow model the intrinsic value of an asset is computed taking into account the future cash flows it will generate and to which the stakeholder is entitled.\n\nThe idea is very simple, if an asset generates cash flows the value of the asset should be that of all the future cash flows it will generate. At the same time, receiving a large lump-sum very far in the future should be worth less than receiving it today as there is a time value of money. Money today can be invested and receive with it certain rate of return, so we should discount the future cash flows to take into account the time value of money.\n\nWe can do this with Ethereum and calculate its intrinsic value. DCF models are particularly sensitive to our assumption of the expected future cash flows and the discount rate so they will be more accurate the better you can forecast them. You can find this model and some base assumptions in the DCF Model tab.\n\n**Why 3 models?**\n\nIn truth, there should only be one model, the one that correctly predicts the intrinsic value of the network. And this model is, in fact, the DCF model. The problem is that correctly forecasting the future cash flows and having a proper estimation of the discount rate is very difficult which makes DCF models quite prone to the garbage in/garbage out phenomenon, where poor assumptions lead to poor predictions of the model. Because of this we can benefit from 2 models that are very simple in comparison:\n\n- The Monetary Model gives us a very good long-term lower bound of the token value. As the network will execute its monetary policy in a way that leads to this price acting as a lower bound long-term. Since the price set by the Monetary Model must hold true in the long-term we can use this price as the terminal value of the DCF.\n- The Yield Model gives us a very good short-term view of the token value. As this yield can be obtained today, giving the market a powerful mechanism to quickly reflect the price that results in a yield comparable to the rest of asset classes (given certain measure of risk). If you set the discount rate to your expected yield you can view the Yield Model as the first-order expansion of the DCF model.\n\nSo the two models are simplified version of the DCF for two different regimes: long-term (Monetary Model) and short-term (Yield Model).",
