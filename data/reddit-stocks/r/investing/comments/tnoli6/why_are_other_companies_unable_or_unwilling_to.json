I have a Fidelity account that I opened early in 2021 with the intention of transferring my portfolio to, but after putting \\~20% of my funds in to test it out, I couldn't convince myself to make the switch. Their mobile app and website are clunky and off putting to use and their desktop app, Active Trader Pro, while extremely powerful is archaic, unintuitive, and looks like it was built for windows 95 and hasn't been updated since.\n\nA big part of investing/trading for me is the ability to quickly ascertain information and then execute on it. In Robinhood that is astoundingly easy. Information about your portfolio is immediately present as soon as you open the app, you can check the status of all of your holdings on the same homepage at a glance, watchlists are presented alongside this information in a way that makes sense, and it all just flows. If at any point I want to buy stock, I can tap the ticker and execute an order within 20 seconds.\n\nFidelity on the other hand (using their \\*new and improved\\* UI), the homepage also shows you a portfolio line graph, however you can only view performance over the last month or year, no 1 day, 1 week, or 1 quarter options, and for some bizarre reason it measures total change in your account rather than ROC/ROI so any deposit or withdrawal makes this information useless. The price charts for stocks are harder to read and update less frequently (5min rather than every few seconds). Buying stock requires twice as many steps/clicks at a minimum. And viewing options chains and trading options in general is a nightmare.\n\nI am not a web/app developer so I cannot speak to the difficulty of improving these systems, but I can't imagine that with the budget these major financial institutions have they wouldn't be able to create a similar user experience that is offered by Robinhood but with a much better company backing it. And I used Fidelity as my comparison just because that is the only other brokerage account I have actively used, but I have seen the UI of TD Ameritrade and Vanguard and was not impressed with them either.",
