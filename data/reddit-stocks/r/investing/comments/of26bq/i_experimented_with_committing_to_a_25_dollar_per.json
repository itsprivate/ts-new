I figured it would be a good way to build up my investment in the company while taking a manageable risk and potentially getting some market gains. Since my brokerage offered partial share investments I figured it would be a fun way to see where my money was in a year.\n\nAfter 1 year here are my results:\n\nStart Date: July 6, 2020\n\nInitial investment: $30 (.023017 shares at 1,300.38)\n\nJuly 6 2021 Investment Value: $2,546.70\n\nTotal Invested with Auto-Transfer: $1,300\n\nTotal Return: $697 (+37.64%)\n\nExtra periodic market buys: ~$550\n\nAverage Cost of entire stake: $447.40\n\nCurrent price of Stock: 657.54 (about 150% gain since initial investment date)\n\nConclusion: Although it would have been great to be able to increase my investment on each dip, having the recurring transfer helped me take advantage of the partial share feature offered by my brokerage and keep my average cost low. During the same time period SPY has gained about 36% so my results are comparable to investing in SPY during the same time so, i potentially took on more risk than if I had just been investing in SPY the whole time. Although it would have been nice to be able put $1300 back in July 2020 and see it more than double, because I didn't have cash on hand, I only got about 1/3 of the potential gains of holding the stock the entire time. Although my returns aren't much better than SPY, I am happy with the results of my little experiment and plan to continue this process and add a few more dollars per week into other companies and ETF's that I feel strongly about.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I know this isn't groundbreaking stuff, but it's a small look into what you can do if you are literally storing the equivalent of 3 lunch meals a week in an investment account. Obviously one side note, the biggest downside to this way of investing is that my tax lots are all over the place and if I have to sell, I have an ongoing 1 year rolling date for \"long\" tax rates but, I don't plan on selling any time soon, so as time goes on, that will be less of an issue.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add a little more context: I currently have $150 a month going into a Traditional IRA, 9% of my income going into a 457 (~350 per check 2x a month) and a bunch that goes into my public servant pension. In addition to that, I regularly put ~200-300 into various stocks and ETF's that I hold each month. Although this investment represents a small amount of what I invest and save, it was probably the most exciting thing to watch all year.",
