The company's 5.9% May 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond , which was also suspended, fell more than 35% after trading resumed.  \n>  \n>The slump in bond prices comes after a ratings downgrade erased the bonds' value for use in pledged repo trading.  \n>  \n>Rules governing pledged repos require bonds issued after April 7, 2017 and pledged as collateral to be rated AAA, while issuers must have credit ratings of AA or higher.
