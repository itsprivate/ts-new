My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. \n\nEvery method of valuation has its pros and cons. For example, the price to earnings ratio can only be used on profitable companies and the price to book ratio is quite terrible with companies that are heavy on intangible assets. I’ve already done write ups on these two ratios for anyone new to these. \n\nSo, none of them are perfect, but one of them can come quite close – with a little bit of help. I’m going to explain what price to sales is, why it works, how to use it, and then I’m going to make a modification to increase its effectiveness.\n\n#**What is P/S?**\nThe price to sales ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s total market cap by it’s total revenue. Why it’s called price to sales and not price to revenue, who knows, but revenue is simply the number of sales times the number of units sold so the name isn’t too far off. \n\nWhat is this ratio actually saying? It’s a way of normalizing the relationship between the market cap and the revenue. Let’s say a company’s market cap is $100 and that their revenue was $25. Dividing 100 by 25 results in a price to sales of four. This means that this company earns 1/4th of its total value each year. This number on its own doesn’t really mean anything, but it’s a way to compare companies to each other. Let’s say we have a second business that has a market cap of $300 and a revenue of $100 which results in a price to sales of three. When market caps and revenues are in the billions it can be hard to tell which one makes proportionally more money. When you normalize them like this you can see that the second company makes 1/3rd of its value each year vs the 1/4th from the first example. \n\nKnowing this, it makes sense to buy companies with lower price to earnings ratios because a lower ratios means you’re making proportionally more money for your size.\n\n#**Real application**\nMost fundamental ratios are aimed at finding good value stocks that may be underpriced, however not everyone is looking for traditional value stocks. Price to sales is one of the few ways to value growth stocks as well as stocks that are not yet profitable. These types of companies often have low or negative earnings. This is likely because they are either just starting to grow, or because they are reinvesting everything back into the company to attempt to grow faster. If you were using price to earnings these would appear to have incredibly high or non-existent ratios and would be quickly ignored by most people. Price to sales still very much applies to value stocks, I simply wanted to show that it’s not exclusive to them like many other ratios are.\n\nSo now you know how to calculate it and that it can be used on almost anything, but how do you actually use it. If you’ve read my other write ups or watched any of my videos you’ll become very familiar with this answer – you use it to compare similar companies in similar industries. The reason for this is because you want to minimize external factors that could shift the results one way or another. Price to sales is often considered to be a judge of popularity because some sectors will have higher ratios simply because they are more popular industries. Innovative new companies working on artificial intelligence or green energy will likely have higher ratios than tobacco or oil companies even if their financial statistics and growth expectations were the same. This is simply because people *like* those companies more.\n\n#**The good and the bad of using sales**\nLet’s dive into the positives of using sales or revenue as a metric. The revenue a company earns is a pretty straightforward number. There are fewer precursory steps to reach it than something like earnings or book value, both of which can be manipulated by different business and accounting practices. This means that it’s generally more reliable than anything that is derived later down the line. As I mentioned before, it can be applied to a wider array of companies because basically every company has a revenue. It also does not get influenced by the ratio of tangible or intangible assets like book value can. This makes it sound far superior to both anything that uses earnings or book value, but it does have some pitfalls. \n\nI had two example companies above, one company worth $100 and earning $25 and one company worth $300 and earning $100. We determined that the second one, which has a P/S of three, was better. What if the first company only had $10 in expenditures while the second company had $75? The $100 company would take home $15 in profit and the $300 company would only take home $25 despite being three times larger. When you multiply P/S by the profit margin you arrive back at P/E. The lesson here is that revenue doesn’t mean as much when you don’t know the profit margins. If you don’t want to be tricked by this, either compare companies that have similar profit margins, or make sure both P/S and P/E agree on which company is better. \n\nThe next pitfall on our list is the issue of cash and debt. A company with more debt has more leverage. They can spend additional money which allows them to generate additional returns. A company with no debt might have $10 to spend which might yield $20 in revenue. A company with x2 leverage has $20 to spend which might yield $40 in revenue. This boosts their revenue but it’s because they were taking on more risk, not because they actually performed better. Thankfully this also has a pretty nice fix. Let’s make up yet another hypothetical company. Company C has a market cap of $500, a revenue of $100, this would give it a P/S of 5. It also has $25 in cash, and $125 in debt. This company has a good chunk of debt which gives them some additional leverage. To make this more normalized we can convert their market cap, the P in our P/S equation, to EV which stands for enterprise value. EV is calculated by taking the market cap and adding the debt and then subtracting the cash. So, for Company C that comes out to be 500 + 125 – 25 = 600. You can now use this to get their EV/S, which is six. This is higher than the five they had before because we took away their leverage. Now all companies can be compared on a more even footing. \n\n#**Conclusion**\nPrice to sales, or as we will now call it, EV/S, is generally considered to be the most effective fundamental ratio out there. Now, just because it is the best doesn’t mean you should use it alone. You should always use fundamental ratios as only one of many available tools. \nNow that the disclaimer is out of the way, let’s see how it does stack up even on its own so that we can give it a fair comparison to other ratios and ideas. Buying stocks with a low P/S ratio outperformed broad market indices 95% of the time during any 10 year period from 1953-2003. During this same period the lowest P/S stocks outperformed the highest P/S stocks by a factor of over 1,000. The stocks with the lowest P/S ratios had an average return of 17.46% and the stocks with the highest had an average return of 3.12%. Whether this will continue to work in the future is, as always, not guaranteed.\nIf you want to make use of this tool for yourself, use EV/S and make sure you look at profit margins. Between these two points you’ll have accounted for the two pitfalls discussed. Use it on similar industries and use it as part of a set. Thank you for reading. \n\n#**TLDR**\nPrice to sales can be misleading on its own, but you can mostly fix this by accounting for differing levels of cash and debt as well as by checking profit margins. This new ratio, after the adjustment, is called EV/S and it is the most effective fundamental ratio, at least on its own. It can be used on value stocks, growth stocks, and even unprofitable companies. Use it, along with other tools, to compare similar companies to find which one is most likely underpriced.\n\n###**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**\nIf you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where myself, and eventually others, will be doing this style of research. \n\n#**Papers on the subject**\n* Data on P/S and how to improve it with modifications\n    * https://www.clutejournals.com/index.php/JBER/article/view/2613\n* What works on Wall Street by James O’Shaughnessy\n    * http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/What-Works-on-Wall-Street-Third-Edition.pdf",
