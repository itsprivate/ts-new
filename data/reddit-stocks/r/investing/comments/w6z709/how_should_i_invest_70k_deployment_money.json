  "selftext": "Hello all, I am an Army Reservist currently deployed. Because everything is paid for over here, I’m sending my wife a check for half the mortgage and bills, and putting $6K a month into savings. I had $20K in savings pre-deployment. So far I have $50K saved up, and should have $80K by the time I return home in December. Coincidentally, I am also inheriting around $20K from my uncle who passed last year. And I’m teaching a college course at the Ed Center while I’m over here, which I will net me few extra thousand. All said and done I should have a little over $100K in the bank when I get home. I plan to leave $20K as an emergency fund, and to use $10K as a healthy down payment on a vehicle. (I sold my car when I left.) And I’ll use a few thousand for a nice trip with my wife. So I should have $70K left to invest.\n\nShould I play it safe and put it in an index fund. Should I wait and see if the stock market goes down more in the next year or so and buy low? Should I use it as a down payment on a rental property? What would you do with the money if you were in my shoes?\n\nFor context, I’m 44 and, I’m a little embarrassed to admit this, but up to now, I’ve done almost no saving for retirement. I used to joke that my retirement plan was to work until I died. But, it wasn’t much of a joke, because that’s precisely what my parents did, and I figured it’s what I would wind up doing too. But now that I’m finally at a point where I am making decent money, and due to this deployment, I will have some starter money to invest, a retirement is beginning to look feasible. Maybe not full retirement, not with the lifestyle I want to maintain, but hopefully at least leaving full time work, and maybe teaching part time at a community college or something chill like that. I have no bad debt, and with my current income, I should be able to put back around $10K a year. That amount, and hopefully more with promotions and pay raises down the line, for 20 years, plus my Army Reserve retirement (around $1500/month starting at 59). If I invest wisely, I should have decent nest egg by then. \n\nBut how should I get started? Where should this $70K go?",
