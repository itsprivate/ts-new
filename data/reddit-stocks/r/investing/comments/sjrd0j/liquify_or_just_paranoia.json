My husband thinks there’s an inevitable stock crash coming and also thinks digital currency will devalue my stock.  He saying I should just liquify all of it because it will not grow and I’d be better off having it In silver and cash.\n\nFwiw, I don’t completely trust his judgment in money. I run a successful business, retirement, and an emergency savings and my father is a banker.  My husband doesn’t save, only buys silver and only deals in cash. No retirement plan because he thinks we won’t be able to? He thinks collapse (in the US) is coming so he is focusing on that. (I don’t agree with this.) I do have some silver, but I’m not obsessed like he is. I understand that it will hold value- but we have an infant. I’d rather have the cash than the silver at this point.\n\n However, do you think there’s any truth to what he’s saying? Should I liquify any stock?  I don’t really want to. I’m more a fan of keeping things diversified.  Or do you think he’s just being overly paranoid?\n\nWould love your thoughts. Thanks!",
