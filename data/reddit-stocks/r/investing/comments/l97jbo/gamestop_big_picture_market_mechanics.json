This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I&#39;m using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Rather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that&#39;s probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.</p>\n\n<p>There was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.</p>\n\n<h1>Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price</h1>\n\n<p>Ok, so let&#39;s go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG\">Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram</a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.</p>\n\n<p>On the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.</p>\n\n<p>The lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it&#39;s not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.</p>\n\n<p>I find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn&#39;t even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!</p>\n\n<p>Since company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.</p>\n\n<p>So, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.</p>\n\n<p>So simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don&#39;t mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).</p>\n\n<h1>Market Games</h1>\n\n<p>So, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don&#39;t really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).</p>\n\n<p>Then you have what I&#39;ll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company&#39;s share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker&#39;s capital too, until they&#39;ve patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s not how you&#39;re supposed to look at it, but that&#39;s kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we&#39;re talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs\">4 minute speed runs</a> through games intended to take<a href=\"https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614\">~100 hrs</a> to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That&#39;s kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds&#39; short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.</p>\n\n<h1>Battleground - Strategy and Tactics</h1>\n\n<p>In a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it&#39;s been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.</p>\n\n<p>With a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each &#39;side&#39;, what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it&#39;s about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>My guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a &lt;$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday&#39;s close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Say what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it&#39;ll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.</p>\n\n<p>How about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you&#39;re buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>The above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you&#39;ve accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it&#39;s effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let&#39;s say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you&#39;ll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you&#39;ve extended to the $300 line, you&#39;re going to pay $3bn.  If you&#39;re an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you&#39;re already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you&#39;re close, then you&#39;re looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.</p>\n\n<p>That is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?</p>\n\n<p>That, at least, is a very high level view of what you&#39;re trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you&#39;re dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they&#39;re willing to reload the short float.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven&#39;t already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of final points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you&#39;re somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.</li>\n<li>Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don&#39;t have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.</li>\n<li>Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I&#39;d have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you&#39;d have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you&#39;re getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you&#39;re about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#8203;</p>\n\n<pre><code>input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;\ninput CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;\ninput GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;\n\ndef trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);\n\nplot trailingAverage = trlAvg;\n\nplot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);\nplot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);\n\nplot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);\nplot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;ll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I&#39;ve mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it&#39;s generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I&#39;ll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).</p>\n\n<p>Hope you all have a good rest of the weekend.  Good luck in the Market on Monday</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
