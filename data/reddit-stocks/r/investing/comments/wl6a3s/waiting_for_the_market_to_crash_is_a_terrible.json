They’re actually better!** Your investment made money over the course of the next year 88% of the time, and **your average total return was +14.6%**.\n\nWith crash calling and correction calling, you have to make two correct market timing calls in a row. When to sell and when to buy back in. I know I can't do that.\n\nThe other issue with waiting for a large correction is when it finally occurs, the people that were waiting will be fearful of the market dropping further and won't put capital to work when they said they would. It's more likely they'll wait until things improve which means the market has already recovered.",
