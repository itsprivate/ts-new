But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.</p>\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.</p>\n\n<p>There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501\">Bloomberg Green</a> / <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501\">Hyperdrive</a> have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
