I cannot get ahold of anyone to even ask a question about this.\n\nEDIT:  thank you u/theMMAal I am ok, it was my own confusion based on the limited information in the letter I received. \n\nSeems that they paid some dividends in worthless stock years ago, which was near the same amount of stock as my original purchase, so when I received the notice today that these shares were worth $300 I was confused (I assumed that was my original holding).\n\nDoesn't help that all this is tied up in a Norweigan broker, I can't get a hold of, or have an account with.\n\nThanks guys.",
