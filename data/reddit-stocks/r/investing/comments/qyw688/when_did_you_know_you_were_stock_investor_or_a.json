It's seems like you need to study alot of quasi science, be on social media constantly, do alot of cocaine, and it really just seems stressful. \n\nThe neat thing about reddit is I can look and see when people post their \"analysis\" of a stock. Which for 99% of reddit, is just a trader saying voodoo witch craft nonsense about enter and exit points, resistance this and that, cutting losses, and special orders. \n\nThen you ask for their portfolio and they have none or its top secret or something. It's not illegal to share your portfolio you great traders. \n\nI'm an average Joe, and I'm not that smart. so I feel really good when I read posts from people who buy a stock like MU, three years ago, at 40-43 a share, and sell it saying they see no future in it. It's trading at like $83 now. \n\nI love it when I read people saying they bought Uber near ipo at 40 and sold at 32 and say it's doomed to fail. But Uber is still around, in fact it hit a height of $60 last spring and now it's $44. You haven't even given it a chance to grow or become something yet. Like the company is a verb, give it a few years. \n\nI think traders are like fake friends in high school. They're only around you if you're cool. Once you're not cool anymore they abandon you. But traders are onlu a small portion of money for a company a company makes stuff to sell to people and that's what really draws in revenue to grow. \n\nI see alot of people talk about the \"opportunity cost\" or \"oppurtuniy lost, \" something like that when you're not trading. Like if I buy something that isn't moving fast, or something is in the red, it's better to \"cut my losses.\" \n\nBut that's like... Buying high and selling low. \n\nThat sounds like the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather sink with my ship if you're telling me to always sell the moment my stock goes red. \n\nif I was so foolish as to pick a bad company, I'd rather just take the full loss, rather then death by a thousand cuts. \n\nBut I pick companies that make more revenue every year, have increasing dividends, and are medium to large size growth companies. \n\nI'm boring. \n\nI just look at the best performing companies, read their 10k and just invest. My first two companies I bought were Apple and Starbucks, I then bought Nvidia and Realty Income. I bought Pennymac and Weyerhaeuser afterward. I just sorta sit on them. I just hold them and buy more. If I somehow become broke instantly from these decisions then damn. \n\nI'm investing in known companies with easy business models. I like safety and simplicity. \n\nI don't believe I'm gonna become a multi millionaire with several cars and boats. I just want to make enough money to be the first millionaire in my family, and have my children live of my dividends so they don't have to work so hard. \n\nIt just seems like people don't have patience on the internet. And when you take the time to read people who argue about a particular stock, and then for those same people to be proven wrong by time. It feels good.",
