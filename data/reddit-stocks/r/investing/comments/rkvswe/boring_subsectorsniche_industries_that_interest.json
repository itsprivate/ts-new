The pump said it was made by a company called Wayne (“a GE Energy Business”), and the nozzle said it was made by OPW (“a Dover Company”). \n\nDover now owns both Wayne and OPW, I found out. And it also owns Tokheim, another gas pump manufacturer.\n\nIn the US, Vontier and Dover seem to have something close to a duopoly in this subsector—although there’s another company called Bennett Pump, which is privately held.\n\nSo if I bought some Dover stock, I would own pretty much everything there is to own when it comes to gas pumps and gas nozzles. (I had the impulse to do that, but I stopped myself.)\n\nWhat are some boring subsectors that you like?",
