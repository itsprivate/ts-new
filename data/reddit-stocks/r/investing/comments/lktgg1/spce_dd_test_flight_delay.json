You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s talk most recent timeline:</p>\n\n<p><strong>December 12 2020</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:%7E:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned\">The test flight didn&#39;t go as planned</a>, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was &quot;what if it blows up?&quot;. This &quot;failed&quot; test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn&#39;t succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.</p>\n\n<p>Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. </p>\n\n<p><strong>February 13 2021:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html\">The test flight was delayed</a>, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It&#39;s hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. </p>\n\n<p><strong>February 2021:</strong> I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q1 2021:</strong> The <a href=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf\">Q3 Earnings Presentation</a> outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;V elements.</li>\n<li>The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. </li>\n<li>The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it&#39;s likely this flight doesn&#39;t take place until Q2)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. <a href=\"https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/\">Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.</a> The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Surviving to 2025:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. </p>\n\n<p>Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.</p>\n\n<p>There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. </p>\n\n<p>Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beyond 2025:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/\">Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market</a>. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let&#39;s play with this number for a little:</p>\n\n<p>Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M</p>\n\n<p>Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share</li>\n<li>SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share</li>\n<li>SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What&#39;s fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at Space Tourism, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html\">the predicted market cap is $3BN</a>, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. </p>\n\n<p>If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov&#39;t contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Beyond 2030:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sci-Fi isn&#39;t really Sci-Fi anymore...it&#39;s just Sci:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let&#39;s talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won&#39;t be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.</li>\n<li>Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic&#39;s space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.</li>\n<li>Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn&#39;t need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.</li>\n<li>Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.</li>\n<li>The list goes on and on and I don&#39;t want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:</strong></p>\n\n<p>While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let&#39;s Talk Technology:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve\">VMS Eve</a> is the name of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two\">WhiteKnightTwo</a> mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo\">SpaceShipTwo</a> is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. <a href=\"https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/\">The cabin</a> has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8T9mVkGh3s\">Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology.</a></p>\n\n<p>Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce <a href=\"https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/\">unveiled the Mach 3 design</a> which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. <a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost\">On a large private jet:</a> $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. </p>\n\n<p>The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Staff and Players:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)<br/>\nCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International<br/>\nCTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA<br/>\nCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Noteworthy Investors</strong>:<br/>\nVanguard<br/>\nBank of America<br/>\nMorgan Stanley<br/>\nARK<br/>\nBoeing<br/>\nChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)<br/>\nCathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Partners</strong>:<br/>\nBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )<br/>\nRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )<br/>\nNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )<br/>\nLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )<br/>\nUnder Armour (suits)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bear Case:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What if it explodes?\n\n<ol>\n<li>As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html\">Tesla decapitated someone</a>? Or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States\">the growing list of Airline incidents</a>? Or how about when <a href=\"https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/\">a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds</a>? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic <a href=\"https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html\">had a fatality in 2014</a> and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>SpaceX:\n\n<ol>\n<li>This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that&#39;s hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX&#39;s largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body\">hypersonic capabilities</a> for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>It is a hype driven stock:\n\n<ol>\n<li>This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren&#39;t here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thank you all for reading, <strong>if you don&#39;t want to actually read this check out the video DD:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V4VxAuQDFM\">Video DD</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn&#39;t some new technology, it&#39;s a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don&#39;t know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a <strong>buying opportunity</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>If this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn&#39;t Watch (TL;DW) video here: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/AKhDnS3Ipic\">TL;DW Video DD</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
