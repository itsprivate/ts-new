This is actually a great way of investing praised by some of the best investors. And one I recommend some of my friends an family.</p>\n\n<p>But my point is, if one has chosen to do this, why on Earth are they still reading <a href=\"/r/investing\">r/investing</a> every single day and commenting that quote every minute.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, the reason why I avoided passive investing was the fact that I love researching and reading about companies, and I don&#39;t see myself without doing it.</p>\n\n<p>So, why do lot passive investors keep reading &amp; commenting all individual stock analysis posts?</p>\n\n<p>PS I&#39;m not a hater, I&#39;m just curious why they do it. IMO they do it because they keep questioning if they really want to stick with passive investing, but I could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>PS2 sorry I&#39;m advance for my English, it&#39;s not my first language :/</p>\n\n<p>Have a great day!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
