I am 90% decided that I want to get out and just spend a few years just crossing off a few items on my bucket list (e.g. doing whatever the heck I want and NOT WORKING).\n\nI have zero debt.  I have retirement accounts going.  I have also saved a decent amount of \"F-you money\" which I currently keep in a popular stock index fund.  Between now and 2025 (when I get out), I plan to save a helluva lot more.\n\nSo my question is this: concerning my \"F-you\" money (for lack of a better term), I want to find that sweet spot between growth and preservation.  I'm looking for something more than a high yield savings account but I don't want the potential volatility of stocks.  I want that money to be there in 2025, but I can accept a little risk because I can always take another assignment and push back my retirement date.\n\nSo, what are my options?  Bonds?\n\nI look forward to reading your opinions.  Thanks!",
