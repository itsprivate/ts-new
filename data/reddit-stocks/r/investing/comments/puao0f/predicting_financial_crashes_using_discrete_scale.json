Here, “log-periodicity” refers to a sequence of oscillations with progressively shorter cycles of a period decaying according to a geometrical series.\n\nIn addition, extensive statistical tests have been performed \\[Johansen et al., 2000, Johansen, 1997\\] to show that the reported “log\u0002periodic” structures essentially never occurred in ≈ 105 years of synthetic trading following a “classical” time-series model, the GARCH(1,1) model with student-t statistics, often used as a benchmark in academic circles as well as by practitioners. Thus, the null hypothesis that log-periodicity could result simply from random fluctuations is strongly rejected\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have presented a synthesis of the available empirical evidence in the light of recent theoretical developments for the existence of characteristic log-periodic signatures of growing bubbles in a variety of stock markets as well as currencies.\n\nWe have here documented 8 unrelated crashes from 1929 to 1998, on stock markets as diverse as the US, Hong-Kong or the Russian market and on currencies.\n\nIn addition, we have discovered a significant bubble on Wall Street ending in 1962 \\[Johansen et al., 2000\\] as well as “anti-bubbles”on the Nikkei since 1990 and the Gold (after the 1980 bubble maximum) \\[Johansen and Sornette, 1999c\\].\n\nQuite unexpectedly, we have shown that the Russian bubble crashing 14 in Aug. 1997 had close to identical power law and log-periodic behaviour to the bubbles observed on Wall Street, the Hong-Kong stock market and on currencies.\n\nTo our knowledge, no major financial crash preceded by an extended bubble has occurred in the past 2 decades without exhibit a log\u0002periodic signature.\n\nIn this context, note that the novel analysis of the Russian index presented here was motivated by Ilinski’s claim of a crash without log-periodic signature, which we have shown to be incorrect.\n\nAll these results, taken together with the remarkable robustness and consistency of the estimation of the exponent β as well as the more important statistics the scaling ratio λ, make the case for power law acceleration and log-periodicity very strong.\n\nIn our opinion, one can no more ignore these very specific and strong signatures which is characteristic of developing bubbles and this calls for further investigations to unravel in more depths the underlying economical, financial and behavioural mechanisms.\n\nThese different cases, together with the 1962 “slow event” as well as the “anti-bubbles”, show that the log-periodic critical theory applies both to bubbles ending in a sudden crash as well as to bubbles landing smoothly.\n\nThis is in fact a strong prediction of our rational model of imitative behaviour. What we have attempted here is not to explain why crashes happens or bubbles exists, but to quantify the process taking place during extended bubbles that very often lead to the rapid regime switching a crash represent. We have offered evidence that bubbles and anti-bubbles have log-periodic and power law characteristics and hence provides for a quantification of extended “moods” on the markets.\n\nWe have furthermore, provided a model which contains the observed signatures. Whether, as proposed, discrete scale invariance or some other mechanisms \\[Sornette, 1998\\] are responsible for the prominent log-periodic signatures observed, only a more detailed microscopic model can answer.",
