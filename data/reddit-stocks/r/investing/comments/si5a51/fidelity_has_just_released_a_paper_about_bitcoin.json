Another common  consideration surrounding bitcoin is whether it offers the same  potential reward or upside as some of the newer and smaller digital  assets that have emerged.\n\nIn this paper we propose:\n\n* Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good, and one of the  primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in  an increasingly digital world.\n\n\n* Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset. No  other digital asset is likely to improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good  because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure,  decentralized, sound digital money and any \"improvement\" will  necessarily face tradeoffs.\n\n\n* There is not necessarily mutual exclusivity between the success of  the Bitcoin network and all other digital asset networks. Rather, the  rest of the digital asset ecosystem can fulfill different needs or solve  other problems that bitcoin simply does not.\n\n\n* Other non-bitcoin projects should be evaluated from a different perspective than bitcoin.\n\n\n* Bitcoin should be considered an entry point for traditional allocators looking to gain exposure to digital assets.\n\n\n* Investors should hold two distinctly separate frameworks for  considering investment in this digital asset ecosystem. The first  framework examines the inclusion of bitcoin as an emerging monetary  good, and the second considers the addition of other digital assets that exhibit venture capital-like properties.\n\n\n[Full Report](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/bitcoin-first.pdf)",
