Usually, I am not one to make posts in a sub like this, but I felt compelled to speak my mind on this topic and see if others feel the same.\n\nAs a preface, I work in accounting (CPA) and enjoy researching market and macroeconomic trends. The semiconductor industry has caught my eye since the beginning of the COVID-19 shutdown. Ever since, I have conducted a good deal of research on the industry. As part of this process I have identified some major players that I believe are worthy investment opportunities for the near/long-term. TSM may be at the top of that list. \n\nOver the course of my research, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) has stood out above the rest, in terms of its impact on the global economy. I have read several news articles, analyst reports, and company filings as part of the research process. I believe the best article that explains the immense power of the firm comes from the WSJ. I encourage everyone to read the article, whether you know about TSM or not. It is a great read for new and seasoned investors alike.

Are there other companies that you believe will be ultra-powerful in a post-COVID world? Please comment! I look forward to reading.",
