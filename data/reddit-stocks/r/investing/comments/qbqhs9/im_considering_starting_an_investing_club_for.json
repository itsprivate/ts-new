Part of what's in it for me and what motivates me to look into it is that teaching others and having others in real life to discuss things with makes me more motivated to care about investing, trading, and generally making money through the purchasing, holding, and selling, of assets (and I like hearing myself talk when I believe it's something that will benefit people :) ).",
