Given future prospects of globally increasing food &amp; oil prices as well as terrible monetary and fiscal policy on my governments part, I don't expect this to change substantially in the foreseeable future with double digit inflation and even more currency depreciation expected over the next couple of years. How would I protect my savings against such insane amounts of reduction in value? Obviously, I can, and do, hold dollars and US equities, but with the state of the US economy as well as the rate of depreciation of the TRY against the USD vs. the rate of inflation, my real return is still negative. Even though I have a long-term investment horizon (10+ yrs), I still want some more liquid assets that keep their, or appreciate in, value to finance trips abroad, my hobbies, etc. should I need the funds. What kind of portfolio would you suggest I hold, given these prospects? Thank you.\n\np.s I'm a senior college student graduating in a couple months (albeit with a full-time job lined up), so I do not currently have a lot of capital to invest into anything, i.e, I'm broke! :^)",
