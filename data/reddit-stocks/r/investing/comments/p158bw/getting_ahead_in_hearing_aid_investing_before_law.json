And hope to start implementing otc between March-July 2022. \n\nThe hearing aid market doesn’t seem to have a whole lot of investment activity compared to other health industry markets. There is an undeniable growth in the market share since this past year. In 2017 Congress passed a law that allows for over-the-counter hearing aids to be sold in the US because hearing aids are not covered in the ACA or Medicare. \nHearing aid corporations have been very much against this idea of OTC hearing aids because they feel that hearing loss is very complicated (and it is). Most hearing aid companies saying that they have no interest in developing an otc hearing aid. Similar to OTC glasses you can buy at the pharmacy. \n\nSonova Holdings is a behemoth in the hearing health industry and this past May 2021 they recently purchased a smart tech headphone/earbud company called Sennheiser. This purchase is in preparation for the OTC hearing aid rollout next year. \nSome other notable companies they own are: \nPhonak (pediatric hearing aids)\nUnitron (micro hearing aids) \nAdvanced Bionics (cochlear implants)\nAudioNova (Europe’s largest hearing aid retailer) \n\nThe acquisition of Sennheiser will definitely raise the bar for sound quality targeted toward hard of hearing individuals. The biggest dilemma in hearing loss is identifying which frequencies need to be amplified and which ones don’t. \n\nPro: OTC hearing aids will reduce the stigma with hearing technology and open the door to costly prescription hearing aids. OTC is only intended to mild to moderate hearing loss. Individuals with persistent hearing loss will eventually need prescription hearing aids. 25 [states](https://www.asha.org/advocacy/state/issues/ha_reimbursement/) have supplemented the ACA with hearing aid coverage mandates for children and 5 of those states also cover adults. Insurance coverage for hearing aids continue to expand. \n\nCon: otc hearing aids could potentially take a large portion of the market share. Larger tech markets like Apple might try their hand at OTC Hearing Aids. There’s still stigma with hearing loss. \n\nDisclaimer: I don’t work for any tech company. I have a 6 year old who wears cochlear implants (CI). He was born deaf and at 9months old had a surgical procedure that inserted electrodes in his cochlea to make him hear synthetically (he speaks and hears really well). The first thing a parent or CI patient is told to do is to choose 1 of 3 Cochlear implant brands to have for the next 30 years. So you get very familiar with all of the brands from all of the initial research.  I’ve been keeping my eye on the market for some time. \n\nSome other corporations on the market are:\nDemant A/S\nCochlear Limited",
