  "selftext": "So I'm 48 years old, and spent most of my life being financially irresponsible.  I will say over the last 10 years I've become a lot more frugal and I guess more \"mature\" with my money.  I still have not done much in the way of investing, mainly just putting money off to side to be idle, which as bad as that is, still not as bad as being in debt.\n\nCurrent situation, I only owe debt on one thing, and that's my house. I currently owe about $100k, and I could sell it tomorrow for $300k.  I don't carry any credit card debt.  I don't have car loans or anything else.  I also own a piece of property I could sell for about $250k.  We have nearly $100k in cash set aside as an emergency fund...which I know is way overkill for our situation, but it's just money we haven't done anything with.  Lastly, my wife and I own a pretty successful business and, part of the reason I keep so much cash off to the side that's accessible is in case we need equipment or during the pandemic it was our fall back to keep things going.  Luckily we didn't need it.   I'm starting to think of some potential ways we may be able to retire and that would include selling this business.\n\nSo I'm wondering if this sounds realistic, because I am completely uneducated in all this as of now, and I'm going to really start soaking up as much info as I can.  I'm thinking of selling our piece of property and using $100k of that to pay off our house.  That would reduce my total debt to $0.  I would then have $100k left over in the house, plus the $100k we have on hand.  I really want to always have $200k accessible to me if possible.\n\nIf we sell our business, then I am thinking we may be able to invest that money in a variety of ways and if we can set up a portfolio that distributes dividends monthly, or even yearly, maybe we can have continuous income without really touching our actual money?\n\nOur business does about $300-$350 every year.  It's over 100 years old, and pretty specialized.  It pays 4 people a good salary.  I don't put a lot of reliance into online business valuation calculators, but it's showing our business having a valuation of about $2.9 million.  That seems really high.  So lets just say realistically we sold it for $750k.\n\nLet's say after taxes, sales fees, etc. we have $600k.  If I took that $600k and invested in some funds (no idea what would be the best options), would it be seriously possible to earn around $30,000 to $40,000 a year just on dividends alone?  That seems crazy.  I've looked at a couple of dividend calculators and feel like I must be putting in the wrong numbers, because even at a 5% yield it was starting off at $30,000 per year and the first thing I asked myself is...why am I still working? haha  Note:  I also earn residual income of $3,000+ per month from a previous business sale a couple years ago.\n\n**TLDR: No investing experience or knowledge at all.  No debt, no mortgage with $200,000 in cash. May sell my existing business and clear $600,000.  Can I invest that $600k in a way to earn $30,000 to $40,000 annually on dividends to live off of plus my existing $36,000+ residual annual income from a previous business sale?**",
