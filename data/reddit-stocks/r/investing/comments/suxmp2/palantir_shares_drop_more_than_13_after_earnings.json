It continues to expect annual revenue growth of 30% or more through 2025.\n\n&gt;But its reported net loss was $156.19 million, wider than the $148.34 million of the fourth quarter in 2020.\n\n&gt;The software company, known for its work with government agencies, said that revenue increased 26% year over year and that it added 34 net new customers in the fourth quarter.\n\n&gt;It also said it closed 64 deals in the quarter of $1 million or more, including 27 of which were at least $5 million and 19 of which were at least $10 million.\n\n&gt;Palantir expanded its commercial business throughout 2021, with revenue up 34% year over year to $645 million. U.S. commercial revenue alone soared 102% with the customer count jumping 4.7 times to 80. In 2021, government revenue gained 47% to $897 million.\n\nPersonal take: Honestly I don't know what would turn investor sentiment on this company at this point. Revenue growth is no longer sufficient without improvement in profitability and cashflow. If the current momentum continues it won't be long for the stock to get below its original IPO price at $10.\n\n**Disclosure**: I long $PLTR, although [I fucking wish that's not the case.](https://wealth.ly/share/WKP49U)",
