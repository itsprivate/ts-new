Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  </p>\n\n<p>Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline\">earnings report</a> that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline\">quality</a>  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline\">Lingering concern</a> over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  </p>\n\n<p>The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX\">S&amp;P 500</a>  and  <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>, for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  </p>\n\n<p>The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR\">Twitter</a> (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    </p>\n\n<p>New Street Research analyst <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline\">Pierre Ferragu</a> tweeted out Thursday that  <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM\">STMicroelectronics</a> (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. </p>\n\n<p>It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  </p>\n\n<p>Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline\">Gary Black</a>, an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline\">recent 10-Q</a> quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>\n\n<p>In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        </p>\n\n<p>Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. </p>\n\n<p>Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
