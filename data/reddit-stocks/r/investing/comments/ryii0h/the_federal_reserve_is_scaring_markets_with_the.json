  "selftext": "Quoting original article [at CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/the-fed-is-scaring-markets-with-the-triple-threat-of-policy-tightening.html):\n\n&gt;Investors  have been preparing for the Federal Reserve to start hiking interest  rates. They also know the central bank is cutting the amount of bonds it  buys each month. On top of that, they figured, eventually, the tapering  would lead to a reduction in the nearly $9 trillion in assets the Fed  is holding.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What they didn't expect were all three things happening at the same time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But [minutes from the Fed's December meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html), released Wednesday, indicated that may well be the case.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The [meeting summary](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)  showed members ready to not only start raising interest rates and  tapering bond buying, but also being prepared to engage in a high-level  conversations about reducing holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed  securities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While the moves are designed to fight inflation and as the jobs market heals, the jolt of a Fed triple threat of tightening [sent the market into a tailspin](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)  Wednesday. The result saw stocks give back their Santa Claus rally  gains and then some as the prospect of a hawkish central bank cast a  haze of uncertainty over the investing landscape.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Markets [were mixed Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html) as investors tried to figure out the central bank's intentions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The  reason the market had a knee-jerk reaction yesterday was it sounds like  the Fed is going to come fast and furious and take liquidity out of the  market,\" said Lindsey Bell, chief market strategist at Ally Financial.  \"If they do it in a steady and gradual manner, the market can perform  well in that environment. If they come fast and furious, then it's going  to be a different story.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fed officials said during the meeting  that they remain data-dependent and will be sure to communicate their  intentions clearly to the public.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Still, the prospect of a much  more aggressive Fed was cause for worry after nearly two years of the  most accommodative monetary policy in U.S. history.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bell  said investors are likely worrying too much about policy from officials  who have been clear that they don't want to do anything to slow the  recovery or to tank financial markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The Fed sounds like  they're going to be a lot quicker in action,\" she said. \"But the reality  is we don't honestly know how they're going to move and when they're  going to move. That's going to be determined over the next several  months.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Clues coming soon  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Indeed, the market won't have to wait long to hear where the Fed is headed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Multiple  Fed speakers already have weighed in over the past couple days, with  Governor Christopher Waller and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  taking a more aggressive tone. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President  Mary Daly said Thursday she thinks the start of balance sheet reduction  isn't necessarily imminent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Chairman [Jerome Powell](https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/)  will speak next week during his confirmation hearing, and a second time  this month following the Fed meeting on Jan. 25-26, when he may strike a  more dovish tone, said Michael Yoshikami, founder and chairman of  Destination Wealth Management.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Stock picks and investing trends from CNBC Pro:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One big factor Yoshikami sees is that while the Fed is [determined to fight inflation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/wholesale-prices-measure-rises-9point6percent-in-november-from-a-year-ago-the-fastest-pace-on-record.html), it also will have to deal with the negative impact of the omicron variant.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"I  expect the Fed to come out and say everything is based on the pandemic  blowing over. But if omicron really does continue to be a problem for  the next 30 or 45 days, it is going to impact the economy and might  cause us to delay raising rates,\" he said. \"I expect that commentary to  come out in the next 30 days.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Beyond that, there are some certainties about policy: The market knows, for instance, that the Fed starting in January [will be buying just $60 billion of bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/fed-will-aggressively-dial-back-its-monthly-bond-buying-sees-three-rate-hikes-next-year.html) each month — half the level it had been purchasing just a few months ago.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fed  officials in December also had penciled in three  quarter-percentage-point rate hikes this year after previously  indicating just one, and markets are pricing in close to a 50-50 chance  of a fourth hike. Also, Powell had indicated that there was discussion  about balance sheet reduction at the meeting, though he seemed to play  down how deeply his colleagues delved into the topic.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So what the  market doesn't know right now is how aggressive the Fed will be reducing  its balance sheet. It's an important issue for investors as central  bank liquidity has helped underpin markets during the Covid tumult.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During the [last balance sheet unwind](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/fed-approves-october-reversal-of-historic-stimulus-leaves-rates-unchanged.html),  from 2017 until 2019, the Fed allowed a capped level of proceeds from  its bond portfolio to run off. The cap started at $10 billion each  month, then increased by $10 billion quarterly until they reached $50  billion. By the time the Fed had to retreat, it had run off just $600  billion from what had been a $4.5 trillion balance sheet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With the  balance sheet now approaching $9 trillion — $8.3 trillion of which is  comprised of the Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities the Fed has  been buying — the initial view from Wall Street is that the Fed could be  more aggressive this time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Uncharted waters'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Estimates  bandied about following Wednesday's news ranged from maximum caps of  $100 billion from JPMorgan Chase to $60 billion at Nomura. Fed officials  have not specified any numbers yet, with Kashkari earlier this week  only saying that he sees the end of the runoff still leaving the Fed  with a large balance sheet, probably bigger than before Covid.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One  other possibility is that the Fed could sell assets outright, said  Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There  would be multiple reasons for the central bank to do so, particularly  with long-dated interest rates so low, the Fed's bond profile being  relatively long in duration and the sheer size of the balance sheet —  almost twice what it was last time around.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"While longer term  yields have rebounded in recent days, if they were to remain stubbornly  low and the Fed is faced with a rapidly flattening yield curve, we think  there would be a good case that the Fed should supplement its balance  sheet runoff with outright sales of longer-dated Treasury securities and  MBS,\" Pearce said in a note to clients.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That leaves investors with a multitude of possibilities that could make navigating the 2022 landscape difficult.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In  that last tightening cycle, the Fed waited from the first hike before  it started cutting the balance sheet. This time, policymakers seem  determined to get things moving more quickly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Markets are  concerned that we've never seen the Federal Reserve both lift interest  rates off zero and reduce the size of its balance sheet at the same  time. There was a two-year gap between those two events in the last  cycle, so it is a valid concern. Our advice is to invest/trade very  carefully the next few days,\" DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas said in his  daily note Wednesday evening. \"We're not predicting a meltdown, but we  get why the market swooned \\[Wednesday\\]: these are truly uncharted  waters.\"",
