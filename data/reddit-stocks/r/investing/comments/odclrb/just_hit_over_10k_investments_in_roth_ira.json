Don’t let anything stand in your ways guys, if you put the hard work in and save nearly every penny and dicepline yourself you can achieve anything you want!!!! This year alone I’m up 36% so far! \nI’m really proud of where it stands right now and I am beyond ready for the next milestone!! It may not sound like a big total to anyone else but for only being 22 and have thAt much between 2 accounts is just crazy and in the last year alone I’ve buckled down and just kept storing money, picked up a side hustle (doordash) and just kept saving money!!!! Ive worked a lot lol! And it’s just real nice to see the goal become a reality!!! Beyond ready for the next goals and ready to keep putting in more work to reach them! \n\n\nFor anyone reading this looking to set financial goals, and is even younger than me or any age in fact, don’t let that stop you, find what works for you and just keep working towards it, step by step you’ll slowly reach it and it’ll eventually come and it’s a really good feeling when you meet it! Everyone keep workin hard at your goals! You’ll meet them! Just like I did!!!!",
