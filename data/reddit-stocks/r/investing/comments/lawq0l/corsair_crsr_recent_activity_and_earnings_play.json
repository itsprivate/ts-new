Corsair manufactures and sells parts for computers, especially gaming computers, as well as the peripherals used in streaming and gaming. Covid has understandably provided a large uptick in sales and we are coming up on Q4 earnings in 8 days, which will include holiday sales. The stock traded as high as $51.37, and has traded between $35 and $45 for some weeks.</p>\n\n<p>What you need to know:</p>\n\n<p>-Relatively small market cap (3.43 Billion)</p>\n\n<p>- Earning&#39;s release for Q4: Feb 9th.</p>\n\n<p>- Announced release of new product (solid state drives) on Jan 28th</p>\n\n<p>- Expected earnings were recently adjusted, with</p>\n\n<p>- Tied for first place in the &#39;computer hardware&#39; category, alongside Logitech</p>\n\n<p>- Last quarter Corsair reported a 100% earnings suprise (0.52 vs 0.26 earnings per share)</p>\n\n<p>Christmas sales will likely be focused around peripherals, like head phones and streaming gear.</p>\n\n<p>A number of Corsair execs announced they will be selling shares direct, ie. will not dilute common shares, direct to institutional investors at $35 per share. This will, hopefully, reduce volatility in the stock, as there is relatively little available for trade, most of it being locked up with execs and institutional owners. It should also set a floor on near term pricing.</p>\n\n<p>Analyst currently give the company a &#39;Buy&#39; and &#39;Strong Buy&#39; rating.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: buy CRSR.</p>\n\n<p>Earnings date: February 9th.</p>\n\n<p>All time high: $52.37</p>\n\n<p>Current: $38.13</p>\n\n<p>Q3 Report: <a href=\"https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial-results\">https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial-results</a></p>\n\n<p>Share sale article: <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/22/dont-worry-about-corsairs-public-offering/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;yptr=yahoo\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/22/dont-worry-about-corsairs-public-offering/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;yptr=yahoo</a></p>\n\n<p>Not financial advice.
