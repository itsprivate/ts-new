I spent the weekend researching it and I believe CRNT has positioned themselves very strategically for a small company and will be able to compete well with their network and 5G plans ahead for the long term. I believe this company do well in 2021. I have not picked up any shares yet. It&#39;s on my watchlist)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
