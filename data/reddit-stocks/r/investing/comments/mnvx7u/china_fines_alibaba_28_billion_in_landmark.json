On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.</p>\n\n<p>Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”</p>\n\n<p>Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.</p>\n\n<p>Source: New York Times: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/china-alibaba-monopoly-fine.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/china-alibaba-monopoly-fine.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Wallstreet Journal: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-hit-with-record-2-8-billion-antitrust-fine-by-chinas-market-regulator-11618018830\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-hit-with-record-2-8-billion-antitrust-fine-by-chinas-market-regulator-11618018830</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
