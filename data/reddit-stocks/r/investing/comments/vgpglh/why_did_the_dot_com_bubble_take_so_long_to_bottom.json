I believe there's a lot of companies that have value in there and I'm waiting to get a good deal on them. In the meanwhile, I'm looking to the past two significant downturns to better understand from a (% likelihood) when that might be. My first question is:\n\n\\- The Dot Com Bubble peaked around March 2000. It bottomed out in Sep 2002. Any ideas why it took so long? Was it due to Septmber 11 or the 2001 recession? Any other significant factors I'm missing here. Did the enron situation have a major impact?\n\n\\- Another signal is the average time since the start of the downturn/market turbulence.\n\nIn the last major recession the peak was around June 2007 and it bottomed out around March 2009, around 21 months.\n\n\\- I'm also looking at the situation with the speculative assets in each of these major downturns, as they have been significantly depreciated near the bottoms (speculative tech stocks were down 90%-99% near the bottom of the dot com bubble, the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index was down 20% two years after the 2007 peak)\n\n\\- Currently Bitcoin, GME, and NFTs have still not fully depreciated to 90%+. Housing is still expensive, while the price probably won't decline like it did in 2007, I'd still expect a correction with the interest rates and layoffs.\n\nAnyways thanks for listening to me ramble. I work as a data scientist, and I enjoy building quantitative models for hard to predict events. If you have any other data points you think might be relevant to perform a statistical analysis to find a market bottom, that would be greatly appreciated!\n\nOther Data Points I'm considering\n\n\\- P/E future 12 months ratios\n\n\\- Moving Averages\n\n\\- Unemployment figures\n\n\\- Inflation % (Whether it shows easing)\n\n\\- Companies Earnings Miss / Expectations\n\n\\- Historical News Cycle Archives",
