Whenever a bond matures, he will reinvest the proceeds in the same rolling maturity profile.  He's been buying bonds in the secondary market, and generally pays a premium above par.  Average yield-to-maturity is around 2.5% - 3.0%, and average coupon payment is roughly the same.\n\nFast forward to this year, with interest rates rising, the fixed income market got crush.  Because of his short duration, he did a little better than the overall bond market.  I was helping him tabulate his account, and saw that he has about $955,000 in par value that he will get back at maturity.  Combine that with about $40k in a Inflation Protected fund (-$5k loss), and about $33.5k in cash, he has a grand total of about $1,028,000.  Did he really grow his account by ~3% in 5 years?  I don't think this is possible.  What am I missing?",
