Below may be a bit of an eye opener for some and a good reminder to others who already know... \n\nALL of the market returns are clustered to just a few days of the ENTIRE time you hold them.  Yes, that is true.  Link below proves this point.   It shows in the 18 year period ending in 2018 if one missed just the best 20 day period your return would have been -0.33% vs. being fully invested INCUDING those best 20 days which would have been:  +5.6%.  How significant was that?  Well if you were in cash for that entire ENTIRE 18 year period you return would have been:  +1.79% (thanks portfoliovisualizer)!  That means if you missed just the best 20 trading days of that near 2 decade period of time you would have earned LESS in stocks by 2% annualized then just being in cash for the whole time period!\n\nIf one assumes 253 trading days for the year (thanks google).  That means missing the wrong **0.5%** of all trading days gets a return less then cash (=20/18 x 253).  \n\nSince NO ONE knows which 20 days are the best 20 days your only option is to hold stocks through the ENTIRE period of time.  Yes reinforcing the mantra, \"time in the market and not timing the market\".  Some may find it interesting as well as the BEST 20 days are nearly always clustered around the WORST 20 days.  So, when the worst days in the market happen when your mettle is being tested is the exact time to do nothing and stay invested so one doesn't miss the best days.\n\nHope this helps some folks understand stock returns are NEVER linear and is the reason returns are higher then that of fixed income holders (cash and bonds).\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/11/what-happens-when-you-miss-the-best-days-in-the-st.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/11/what-happens-when-you-miss-the-best-days-in-the-st.aspx)",
