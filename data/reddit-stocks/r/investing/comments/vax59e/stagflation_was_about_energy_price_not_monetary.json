Note that it is in today’s prices (e.g. adjusted for inflation). Before even looking at the 1970’s, look at the 50’s and 60’s. Each decade brought new incremental lows to the price of oil, and society was designed around the premise of cheap oil, from travel to manufacturing to home heating. Little effort was made on efficiency, because for almost 3 decades oil got progressively cheaper each year. Like a Thanksgiving turkey, the American economy loved the farmer that fed it from December to November.\n\nNow we come to stagflation. Oil went from $28 a barrel in December 1973 to  $63 in January of 1974 - just a month later. The historical high price of oil was $32 in 1948. To put this in modern terms, it would be like oil hitting $300 a barrel by mid-July from $120 now. This energy shock is what caused the twin pillagers of economic stagnation (they laid me off!) and inflation (it costs me how much to fill up my tank?). The problem was not bad monetary policy in 1973. I mean, it might have been bad, but  it didn’t matter much at all compared to the overnight explosion of prices in the necessary commodity that underpinned the global economy, from food to airplanes. I really must emphasize the food point, without tractors and gas we can’t feed 98% of the world with only 2% working the fields. Minus fossil fuels, that ratio flips - you need 98% of the population farming to feed the lucky 2% who can have a different job. That’s what made the medieval era different. \n\nWhy did oil skyrocket like that? [Because America’s support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war of 1973 led to the OPEC oil embargo](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/oil-shock-of-1973-74). As we are learning now, if an oil cartel decides to pick a side in a war, they can take a pound of flesh. Though Russia is only a fraction as dominant now as OPEC was then. \n\nI’ve seen folks debating whether Volker’s deflationary and merciless interest rate hikes helped lower demand enough. I’ve seen folks suggest Reagan’s inflationary and optimistic tax cuts somehow voodooed the economic back into shape. Both are efforts to paint the target on top of the bullet holes already in the wall. Oil peaked in May of 1980 and dropped off a cliff in January 1986*. The reason for that collapse? [Saudi Arabia wanted to take more market share and increased production](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1986/06/1986b_bpea_gately_adelman_griffin.pdf). The lesson of stagflation isn’t some cautionary tale about monetary policy. It’s about the price of energy, full stop. Preventing Volker or Reagan had anything to do with it more than on the margins is just an exercise in comfort - it’s nice to think that we can choose leaders who might fix something. In reality they are all riding the same elephant, and they aren’t the ones telling it what to do. Some, however, do a better job of convincing others that they are in charge. \n\nThe one thing we could (and did) meaningfully do that was in our control was reduce waste - double pane windows to keep heat inside in winter, smarter manufacturing processes, more fuel efficient cares, etc. The decline in price from 1980 to 1986 was the product of getting smarter about energy use. Saudi Arabia just saw the writing on the wall and decided to grab market share while it could. It was in their interest to encourage uncritical oil consumption long term. \n\nAny news article or comment you see that brings up the dreaded specter of stagflation had better provide a reason for why we change-point jump into a new energy pricing regime, because that’s what it takes. Be as pessimistic or optimistic as you’re intuition allows about what’s coming, but it’s important to know the history of stagflation given how much it’s coming up. And that history is basically: you are in less control than you think you are. \n\nNow, with all that in mind, scroll down to the [third graph on this page](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth). This (long term, not short term) is the most important thing happening right now, just like the OPEC embargo was the most important thing happening during stagflation. The cheaper energy is, the less we have to think about it, and the more we can think about computers, social networks, graphics cards, AI, EVs, etc. The fun economy starts after the “eat your vegetables” economy of energy price ends. \n\n*It’s not a coincidence that the Soviet Union collapsed a few years after the oil price collapse. Russia then, as today, had an economy dependent on fossil fuel exports. But they got used to a high price.",
