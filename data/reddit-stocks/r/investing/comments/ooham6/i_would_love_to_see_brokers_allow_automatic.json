Say you have 2 stocks and $1000 capital, you allocate 70% to stock 1 and 30% to stock 2. $700 of stock 1 is bought and $300 of stock 2. 30 minutes before market close, stock 1 is up $100 and stock 2 is still at $300. The portfolio manager sells $30 of stock one, so that at EOD you have around 70% in stock 1, 30% in stock 2.\n\nI feel like this would be great for holding long term stocks. You would automatically sell highs and buy lows on a miniscule scale, without needing to think about. This would of course be optional, and you could opt to just use the feature to adjust your portfolio when/if you want.\n\nThe real key feature would be grouping. Say you create 3 groups, one for tech, one for finance stocks, and one for pharmas. You allocate 50% to the tech stocks, 30% to the finance stocks, and 20% to the pharma stocks. Say you have 5 stocks in each group- the 5 in the tech stocks would each get 10% of your portfolio, with 6% in the finance stocks and 4% in the pharmas. You add a stock to the tech stocks group, and the portfolio automatically adjusts so that each tech stock now gets 8.3% of the capital.\n\nJust an idea I wanted to share. It wouldn't be difficult at all to implement a spreadsheet for this but going through and adjusting each stock manually just isn't worth it.",
