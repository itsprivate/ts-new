The bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) price fell below $20,000 on Saturday and is trading at $19,379 on Sunday morning, a loss of 29.36% over the past week. It briefly slipped below $18,000 on Saturday afternoon, but the price so far has rallied 1.18% over the past 24 hours. Ether ([ETH-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD?p=ETH-USD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), which is more intertwined with crypto’s DeFi segment that has lately wrecked havoc on the risk management strategies of significant industry players, is trading at $1,039 per coin, a loss of almost 29% in the last week. On Saturday, its price dipped below $900 before bouncing back. Crypto’s total market capitalization has dropped by almost $300 billion since last [Friday’s hot inflation data](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/may-inflation-data-june-10-2022-212834308.html), from $1.19 trillion to $891.4 billion as of Sunday morning, according to Coinmarketcap.",
