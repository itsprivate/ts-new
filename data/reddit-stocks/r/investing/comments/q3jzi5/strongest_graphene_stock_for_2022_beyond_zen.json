  "selftext": "I've been trying to spread relevant info surrounding ZEN/ZENYF since May of this year and I believe now is one of the lowest-risk/highest growth periods of this companies' lifetime:\n\n[ZEN Graphene Solutions - Intellectual Property Showcase - 3 Year Anniversary BOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/njg9jj/zen_graphene_solutions_intellectual_property/) May 23rd\n\n[ZEN Graphene Business Case](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/o6emex/zen_graphene_business_case/) June 23rd\n\n[Zen Graphene with 'Paradigm Changing Applications' in Healthcare, Green Energy, and Materials Science](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/pgm7at/zen_graphene_with_paradigm_changing_applications/) Sept. 2nd\n\n[Zen Graphene Business Execution Plans for 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/powuln/zen_graphene_business_execution_plans_for_2022/) Sept. 15th\n\nThese all contain very relevant info, but some may be outdated at this time.\n\nThere is virtually no institutional ownership, a **measly 0.03%**. The **insiders own \\~6%** with largest being CEO Greg Fenton for 2.5 mil shares. This is in all aspects, a retail supported stock. 99.3 million shares if fully diluted. That leaves 93 million shares being represented by people like you and me. Francis Dube, CEO from 2019-2020 was an activist shareholder that helped remove the terrible previous management in 2018 and pushed the R&D development and continues to be a face for the company. Greg Fenton, CEO, has been purchasing massively from the market over the past years. This year he bought $500k in shares, while his salary is only $137k.\n\nIt is currently classified as a Mining stock, with the Albany deposit being the primary focus. This is dead wrong, as they have been in R&D for Graphene applications for the past 3 years. Just 3 weeks ago, Sept. 22nd, they announced commercial success of their Healthcare direction as Health Canada approved their antipathogen compound coated mask, 99.99% efficacy against viruses, bacteria, and fungus. They are available for order, shipping TBD since production will primarily come online toward November with majority of product going to high priority areas like Hospitals, and nursing homes. [vitalhealthsupplies.ca](https://vitalhealthsupplies.ca/home/). Management has specified that they are pursuing the Healthcare sector primarily but have significant other opportunities.\n\nExpects to reach a production capacity toward 9-10 billion in coating equivalent for masks come November, which could go to use on HVAC filters, gloves, and high-touch surfaces as these applications seek approval in 2022. Currently, management estimates they will receive earnings of $0.03-$0.06/mask. Global mask usage is estimated to remain toward 930 billion masks per year or similarly elevated levels for the foreseeable future. If they were to capture just 1% of the current mask market,\n\n**they could see** ***$270-$540*** **mil** **in 2022**, as EPS, ***$3-$5, the current stock price.*** Giving me a ***PT for later 2022 of $40*** or more from P/E projectability alone and disregarding any other potentials for the new year. The upside is immense. Potential for vertical integration of supply re their fully owned Albany Graphite deposit from when they were a mining company. They have just secured IP rights to a graphene-exfoliation process from [University of Guelph](https://www.zengraphene.com/zen-graphene-solutions-announces-filing-of-patent-applications-under-the-patent-cooperation-treaty/).\n\nThey are an IP-development company and have many commercially viable products, such as fuel additives, antiviral,bacterial,fungal medicine (of which there is no other), rapid detection kit for bodily fluids & any pathogen + certain cancers, various other applications such as:\n\n>3D conductive filaments for a variety of applications, graphene quantum dot synthesis and applications, graphene synthesis, upscaling recycled plastics, magnetic filament fabrication\n\nfrom [Zen Graphene Business Execution Plans for 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/powuln/zen_graphene_business_execution_plans_for_2022/)\n\nThere are massive changes coming, and management is very transparent with their plans. It's hard not to be optimistic when everything is laid out in front of you, while management outwardly expresses that they are undervalued.. and I tend to agree. There is little investor exposure, due to it being listed as a mining stock. Tech/healthcare followers would be far more interested. Uplistings to NASDAQ/TSX are expected later this year/2022. It has been stated by management, that institutions in the U.S. simply cannot invest in ZEN due to it being on the pink sheets, Institutional ownership, again is at 0.03%. There is significant interest by these institutions, and I anticipate Uplistings to be a catalyst of their own due to the liquidity increase.\n\nWhat is it worth when they offer a extremely effective solution to air quality for personal protection and passive filtration?\n\nWhen they offer a potential medicine that kills bacteria, viruses, and fungus?\n\nWhen they offer rapid-aptamer fluid derived tests for virtually every pathogen?\n\n$1 billion?\n\n$5 billion?\n\n$10 billion?\n\nIt definitely isn't worth $500 million, with one of these opportunities alone.\n\nOn possible upcoming 1-2 month releases:\n\n* foreign agreements for approved product or other contracts,\n* TSX uplisting, with voluntary de-listing from TSXV\n* TSXV authorizing ZEN for change of business from mining to science, healthcare or industrial company, typically a change of business takes around 2 months\n* corrosion resistant coating\n* updates on antimicrobial,viral,fungal treatment, human trials TBA\n* FDA process for U.S. approvals over 2-5 months, probably faster with process in Canada completed\n* regulatory decision of Rapid aptamer saliva test for Covid and her variants, 6 months for full platform of most pathogens\n\nI am long for 36500 shares and intend to maintain long for 2-3 years based on current potential.",
