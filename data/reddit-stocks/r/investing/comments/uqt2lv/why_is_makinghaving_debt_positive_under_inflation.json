So maybe it helps if I tell you quickly my situation:\n\n- My wife and me make around 250k a year, being engineers\n- We bought a place for 700k two years ago and still have around 400k in debt to pay\n\nNow our goal was always to pay off the remaining 400k asap, so I have this ballast off my shoulder and we could be done in 6 years max. Then, being debt free I figured I could live more freely, investing the then higher savings (from not paying the mortgage anymore) into whatever. But mostly not being under the pressure of having debt.\n\nI have issues, while understanding the theory, to see the positive in practice. I „feel“ that my grocery bill is now 10% higher than months ago because of inflation . I feel that in my wallet that I have to pay more for the same. That’s negative.\n\nBut I don’t „feel“ the positive impact on inflation on having debt. I know(or maybe I don’t) that debt must be worth less under inflation. But I cant recognise this.\n\nI was advised to not pay off the debt asap because of inflation, I just don’t seem to get it. To be fair, as an engineer, economics was not part of my classes.\n\nI‘d appreciate your time to help me. What should I do? Keep the debt longer and make even more debt (in order to do what?\n\nThank you!",
