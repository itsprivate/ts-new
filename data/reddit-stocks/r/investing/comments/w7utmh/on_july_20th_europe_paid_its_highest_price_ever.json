Sometimes, it  results in sky-high prices where energy is in short supply when it is  needed. At other occasions, prices can tumble to zero, or go negative,  when producers cannot sell their power into a congested transmission  system. Increasingly, it puts the whole system at risk. Talk to most  industry executives and you quickly get the sense that we  are sleepwalking into more blackouts. Discuss the problems with the  engineers who manage the system day-in, day-out, and that danger appears  even closer.    \n\n\nThe £9,724.54 price, settled between noon and  1:00 p.m. on July 20 via the so-called NEMO interconnector that links  the UK with Belgium, was the highest Britain has ever paid to import  electricity, nearly five times higher than the previous record. The  absurdity of that level is apparent when comparing it with the  year-to-date average for UK spot electricity: £178 per megawatt hour.\" -[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-25/london-s-record-9-724-54-per-megawatt-hour-to-avoid-a-blackout?srnd=premium-uk](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-25/london-s-record-9-724-54-per-megawatt-hour-to-avoid-a-blackout?srnd=premium-uk)\n\nThere wasn't a huge amount of energy purchased. Only enough to power 8 houses for a year. But the purchase adds some clarity to the desperate situation unfolding in Europe. The electricity demand for households goes up during the Winter as people run heaters, light their homes during shorter days, and tend to stay inside more often. The heat wave in Europe is unprecedented. July 19th, 2022 was Europe's hottest day in history at 40.3C (104.5F,) so these are far from normal circumstances. But with Nord Stream 1 operating at 20% of it's capacity, and the recent news of further turbine hold-ups, the European gas outlook is dictated by someone who doesn't like them. Germany may need to start rationing gas to be able to build up storage for the Winter. When Freeport resumes partial plant operation in October, I believe nat gas will get a huge bump as US producers become able to take advantage of the price differences. \n\ntl;dr Bullish on US gas producers",
