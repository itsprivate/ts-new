Merger estimate in Feb/ early March.</p>\n\n<p>- They already have over 50% of market share on class 3-7 EV trucks.</p>\n\n<p>-  Production had already started in 2018, with already 100+ vehicles on  the road, compared to peers HYLN, XL, NKLA, they have ZERO vehicle on  the road, they haven&#39;t even started production yet.</p>\n\n<p>- FIXED contract for EV fleet orders with Amazon and IKEA, guaranteed revenue already for 2021</p>\n\n<p>-  FIXED contracts with Ford for shells and fleet electrification and  Romeo Power for batteries, with decreasing cost over the years.  guaranteed revenue already for 2021</p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/06/newsom-plan-includes-1point5-billion-to-boost-electric-hydrogen-vehicles.html\">California will include a $1.5 Billion stimulus package for EV and Hydrogen vehicles</a></p>\n\n<p>- Dems winning senate, EV will continue to go up.</p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ouv65gdbkq961.jpg\">Going on Cramer&#39;s Mad Money soon</a></p>\n\n<p>- 25% of outstanding shares will be for SPAC investors, this is huge - as most SPACs only leave ~10% to retail investors.</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>GIK has options</strong></p>\n\n<p>IMO, GIK is under the radar because the other Giga SPAC is merging with some garbage (G I X, avoid it). It was also overshadowed by some other catalysts on the market recently. At this price, you have minimum  downside. This will run like XL, but better.</p>\n\n<p>I expect this to run high in FEB when it gets  closer to merger. However, it is difficult to time EV SPACs. The next  major catalysts would be: Cramer show appearance, Merger Vote date announcement, Actual Merger.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR:</p>\n\n<p>Lightning eMotors merging with GigaCapital3  (Ticker: <strong>GIK</strong>) - PT $20+.</p>\n\n<p>Positions:</p>\n\n<p>GIK - 200 Commons, 300 Warrants</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
