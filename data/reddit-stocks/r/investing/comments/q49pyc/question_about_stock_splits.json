What's stopping a company from splitting their stock often versus rarely?\n\nIf I had a company and I was adamant at keeping the stock low, could I split the stock every time it got to $100, so that it was around $50? Then after that split it jetted up to $100 within a year, could I split it again or would I have to wait for X years or some predetermined length of time?\n\nThanks!",
