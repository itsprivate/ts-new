During prolonged downturns, you&#39;re rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn&#39;t trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?</p>\n\n<p>Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that&#39;s the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?</p>\n\n<p>If the drawdowns didn&#39;t affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?</p>\n\n<p>I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. &quot;no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance&quot; or &quot;(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds&quot;, but I&#39;m having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven&#39;t shown it here, but it&#39;s hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don&#39;t have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.</p>\n\n<p>I would post this on <a href=\"/r/changemyview\">/r/changemyview</a> if it weren&#39;t so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. </p>\n\n<p>I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. </p>\n\n<p>As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
