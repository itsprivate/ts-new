The bigger ones are much safer and secure but junior miners have the possibility to bring better rewards despite the risks behind it. Is it smart to buy when there’s a dip in the prices? There are some people telling me that it’s okay and is a good idea but I don’t know if I’m doing it right. There are also some coaxing me to go for physical gold.
