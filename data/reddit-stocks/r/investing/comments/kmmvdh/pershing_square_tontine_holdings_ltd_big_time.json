Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable names.</p>\n\n<p>Since then and since my last post, a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>\n\n<p>PSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. For context, Chamath&#39;s largest SPAC (IPOF) is worth $1.6B. PSTH is worth $5B with the option to increase to $7B. It is enormous. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a “mature unicorn”. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Two Key points in addition to the TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Two aspects of this stock that most people miss to begin with (I&#39;ve engaged with enough of them online to know):</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Tontine: detailed below but in essence, for every common share you buy now AND hold through the merger and ticker change, you get 2/9 a warrant exercisable at $23. That means for every 9 commons you own, you will receive another 2 commons later at a price of $23 (the stock trades at $26 today)</p>\n\n<p><strong>AKA if you own 99 commons through the merger, you get 22 more shares at $23 cost each simply for holding through the merger.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>THIS is what 2/9 Tontine means. It can grow to 3/9 or 4/9 if people choose not to hold through the merger, because the number of warrants is constant and will all be given out to someone.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>***Another note here: beware the manager&#39;s right to redeem warrants. This is in the S-1 but the manager&#39;s have the right to redeem warrants if the share price meets or exceeds $36 on 20/30 trading days. They have to give you 30 days notice, so just keep that in mind. The warrants are exercisable at the later of 1) 30 days post merger or 2) 1 year post listing which was in July 2020. So as long as you are keeping an eye on events, you will be okay. Don&#39;t fall asleep on the stipulation though.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For example, if the stock price was to jump to $50 on LOI and then the merger happens 2 months later, 30 days post that merger you warrants go live but so does the manager&#39;s right to issue a redemption notice. At that point you would likely consider redeeming the warrants since at the end of that window they could be taken by manager for pennies each. No upside cap based on my reading of the S1, but just be vigilant once the merger is announced.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> The bank set up. Typically the big banks gouge the eyes out of IPOs and traditional SPACS with fees, etc. We have seen big big misses on the order of $3-4B for both Snowflake and ABNB. With PSTH, Ackman has went a different route abandoning the large cap banks and instead giving underwriting privileges to a ton of small and minority owned banks and credit lenders. This is a legacy move. He&#39;s more interested in changing the landscape because he believes (and has explained) that quality public entry structures are the best improvements we can make for the economy, society, and the common retail investor. The structure also incentivizes him to make an exceptional deal, that&#39;s the only way he makes money through the warrant system, if the deal goes well. This is why HUGE names are on board, but only one big bank is. This SPAC is opposing the conventional bank-led IPO process. That in itself, is a game changer and once this pops and gets press you can bet your boots that future SPAC leaders (Chamath, etc.) will transition to this method.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background information and recent events</strong></p>\n\n<p>· In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH – the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackman’s hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.</p>\n\n<p>· In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:</p>\n\n<p>o He is hunting for a “mature unicorn” - unicorn is defined as $1B or more but &quot;mature&quot; here is the key, he&#39;s looking for a company worth tens of Billions.</p>\n\n<p>o He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth</p>\n\n<p>o This means a large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company according to Ackman. He has explicitly said he&#39;s also friendly to a FINTECH</p>\n\n<p>o He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $30-40B.</p>\n\n<p><strong>o Ackman has recruit an incredible board of directors at PSTH, leveraging raw talent from both media and fintech sectors:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lisa Gersh - Former management executive at NBC News</p>\n\n<p>Michael Ovitz - Former President at The Walt Disney Company</p>\n\n<p>Jackie Reses - Former executive at Square, mobile payment company</p>\n\n<p>Joseph Steinberg - Current Chairman of Jefferies Financial Group Inc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>**We don&#39;t want to jump to conclusions, but on review of the board, this is certainly a MEDIA and FINTECH heavy group of executives*\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<p>o He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far</p>\n\n<p>o <strong>Investors in the SPAC so far include:</strong></p>\n\n<p>§ Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, “the next Buffet” and noted value investor) = $450M position</p>\n\n<p>§ Guggenheim Capital = $560M position</p>\n\n<p>§ Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position</p>\n\n<p>§ Soroban Capital = $290M position</p>\n\n<p>§ Wells Fargo = $290M position</p>\n\n<p>§ Kevin “Sharktank” O’Leary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1</p>\n\n<p>§ <strong>Warren Buffet’s</strong> position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.</p>\n\n<p><strong>§ KEY Point: **No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH*\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<p>o The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).</p>\n\n<p><strong>PSTH SPAC Design</strong></p>\n\n<p>· PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:</p>\n\n<p>· PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique “tontine” structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the &quot;tontine&quot; name - look it up, pretty cool.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Targets</strong></p>\n\n<p>Much speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:</p>\n\n<p>· Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&amp;B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.</p>\n\n<p>· Since that interview, Air B&amp;B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO</p>\n\n<p><strong>· Stripe has generated intense interest online.</strong> Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that “no such deal” had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brother’s in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/YoloCapitalMgmt/\">u/YoloCapitalMgmt</a> on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).</p>\n\n<p><strong>· Bloomberg remains in play.</strong> There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.</p>\n\n<p>· Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Target summary based on my view</strong></p>\n\n<p>Targets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bloomberg</li>\n<li>Stripe</li>\n<li>Fidelity</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Bill Ackman</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few notes on the CEO of the SPAC, William A. Ackman:</p>\n\n<p>· A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you’re interested in looking into it.</p>\n\n<p>· He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.</p>\n\n<p>· In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%.</p>\n\n<p>· Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific</p>\n\n<p>· Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some other notes</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.</p>\n\n<p>While this isn’t objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into.</p>\n\n<p><em>Here&#39;s the PSTH S1</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520175042/d930055ds1.htm\"><strong>https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520175042/d930055ds1.htm</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wallpaperflare.com/white-rocket-space-launch-launching-spacex-falcon-heavy-wallpaper-pcyul\">https://www.wallpaperflare.com/white-rocket-space-launch-launching-spacex-falcon-heavy-wallpaper-pcyul</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
