  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>If you&#39;re in the US, A Roth IRA allows you to invest after tax money (that is money that is already sitting in your bank account, you&#39;ve already paid taxes on it through your employer), and then it grows tax free and can be taken out in retirement tax free. For most people, it&#39;s absolutely the best vehicle to use for growth. Max it out each year and don&#39;t take any out until retirement.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, let&#39;s say you&#39;re 30. You have 30+ years to retirement. If markets behave as they have on average, your portfolio should double more than 4 times over that time. If you were in a traditional IRA, that 1600%+ growth would be taxed at your tax rate in retirement when you take it out with distributions. If you invested in a Roth IRA, all that growth is yours to keep, tax free.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s an example using <a href=\"https://www.investingfees.com/calc/investment/\">this calculator</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Start with $10,000. Invest an additional $6,000 each year. Earn 10% each year (a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/\">reasonable</a> <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/average-stock-market-return\">estimate</a> for long term returns). Repeat for 30 years. At the end of 30 years, you&#39;ll have invested $190,000. You&#39;ll have accumulated $<strong>1,161,458.16</strong>. If you used a traditional IRA, you would have saved some taxes on that $190,000 you put in, however you&#39;ll be paying tax on all the gains when you take the money out. If you used a Roth, you would enjoy that $1,161,458 tax free in retirement. It&#39;s worth noting inflation will reduce the buying power of that sweet $1M+...all the more reason to be invested and keep all the growth you can get.</p>\n\n<p>Where to invest if you&#39;re just starting out? I&#39;d suggest Vanguard with a low-cost index ETF like &quot;VTI.&quot; Young and/or want to take on more risk in hopes of higher returns? Consider putting a portion in ETF&#39;s like VGT, ARKK, QCLN, or any other sectors you think will outperform the market.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps. Get your kids to start a Roth as soon as they have a job. Compound growth were the first words I tried to teach my kids. I was still happy with &quot;dada.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
