  "selftext": "    My daughter came to my wife an I a week ago asking how she could earn  $1,000 usd to convert to Robux. Naturally we asked her why and she was prepared to answer. \n\nApparently there was an item on the Roblox market place she had been tracking the value of. It is called “Super super happy face”. Trust me you can’t make this shit up. It was trading for 118,898 Robux. Don’t ask me for usd conversion rate but she had it figured out. Probably roughly $1,000. \n\nAnyhow she did a DD on it. And the person selling it posted on their profile it’s price was definitely going up in value. That’s some solid guidance but she didn’t stop there. My kid charted it out. She tracked the last few sales. Sure enough the line went almost straight up. It was even better than Jan 2021 meme stonks. No dips. None. Just up. By this time she had me on board. To my wife’s dismay I reached for my credit card. I couldn’t believe it. My own kid had found the fool proof plan. Our ticket to tendies. \n\nShe had an EOY target price of $1 million. I’m not sure if this was usd or Robux. It didn’t matter for her strategy. I asked her how we could convert it back to usd to cash it out. And she looked confused. “Why would we ever need to do that? After I sell it I have 5 other items I’m going to trade for that also will only go up in value”\n\nIt was at this moment I realized she might have a problem. To me this is no different than making a $1,000 deposit on Draft Kings and hitting a multi leg first basket parlay for $1 million and never intending to make a withdrawal. Her entire well thought out plan has zero intentions of EVER converting any of the profits back into $USD. Her generation believes they can purchase anything and everything they would ever need using Robux so why convert back to inflation prone usd?\n\nThankfully she hasn’t discovered futures or options yet but it’s only a matter of time.\n\nEdit I wrote this a few months back near the beginning of the year and have no clue what the current value of the “super super happy face” is. It would be interesting if someone could find out to see how the trade would be doing so far. Lol. If not I’ll ask her to look later on and report back.",
