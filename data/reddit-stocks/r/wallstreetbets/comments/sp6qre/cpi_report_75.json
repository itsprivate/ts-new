  "selftext": "&gt;CONSUMER PRICE INDEX – JANUARY 2022  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.6 percent  in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 7.5  percent before seasonal adjustment.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Increases in the indexes for food, electricity, and shelter were the largest  contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index rose  0.9 percent in January following a 0.5-percent increase in December. The energy  index also increased 0.9 percent over the month, with an increase in the  electricity index being partially offset by declines in the gasoline index  and the natural gas index.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in January, the  same increase as in December. This was the seventh time in the last 10 months  it has increased at least 0.5 percent. Along with the index for shelter, the  indexes for household furnishings and operations, used cars and trucks, medical  care, and apparel were among many indexes that increased over the month.      \n&gt;  \n&gt;The all items index rose 7.5 percent for the 12 months ending January, the  largest 12-month increase since the period ending February 1982. The all items  less food and energy index rose 6.0 percent, the largest 12-month change since  the period ending August 1982. The energy index rose 27.0 percent over the last  year, and the food index increased 7.0 percent\n\nJPOW: Fuck your calls \n\n[Full Report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)",
