Revolvers are all loaded and pointed at each other, but no one wants to shoot because the first person that does, not only gets all the blame from their peers, but also crashes the market.\n\nIt's just like why BIG money Cramer says everything is fine, the worst is behind us. It's not. The housing market, the equities market, the derivatives market, the \"Decentralized\" market, the commodities market; they're all either already in a correction phase or need a massive adjustment. \n\nThings have been overpriced and over-levered for years. There is a reason that when big-time execs come onto Air to talk or give their input, it's usually \"It's not that bad\", \"The worst is behind us\", \"Big potential upside\". It's because everyone in High Finance knows that if anyone speaks out, gives rise to panic, or plainly tells the truth - then the market will crash. It's literally the exact same shit that happened in 07, but this time it's not just subprime shit masked by a box scented with lavender, it's everything. Heck, the stonk market is almost twice as levered now as it was back then. Below is a graph on Margin Debt outstanding on accounts against the Wilshire 5000. Pink lines are recessions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5azp57eb3gb91.png?width=714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dbb159d60648d7188fb24026cc39e15862a472b\n\nIt's especially retarded because the Fed is raising rates on 30.4 TRILLION of outstanding debt. For reference, 07 was 8-10 Trillion. Good thing we've only accumulated 20 trillion over 15 years. \n\n[Money Printer go BRRRRRRRRRRRRR](https://preview.redd.it/lio71wvx6gb91.png?width=1253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd241e30397e23a3521fe2e60cc087b9cf0e99c9)\n\nI work in IB and part of my job is adjust our pricing model based on fed CMTs, and every week, when my MD and I discuss, he consistently says \"Man, things are bad, but they are gonna get worse. It has to, 'cause if it doesn't, it'll get even worse. Watch.\"\n\nMy prediction: The end of July/early august will present two important factors. One, the CPI report for July (9.5%-10.2%). Two, the actual GDP report for Q2 (Negative, triggering recession). This causes housing and equities market to drop 40-50% over the next year.\n\nI'm not trying to fear monger, or incite anything.
