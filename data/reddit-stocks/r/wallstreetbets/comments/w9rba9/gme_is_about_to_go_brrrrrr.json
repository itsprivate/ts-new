I did a full YOLO direct rollover with my $250k and bought in at $300+ which took me like 3 months to get over because I could have had 3 times the amount of shares had I waited or dollar cost averaged. (I know….. a true ape) \n\nFast forward 14 months and somehow I have managed to survive without any income. I sold my truck that was paid off. I sold my RZR for a small profit. I got some money back from my tax return but I’m afraid I have nothing more to sell and it’s time for me to return to the workforce. After everything we’ve been through I can honestly say I have no regrets. I have enjoyed the time spent with my family. I’ve picked up a few new skills. I’ve lost 30lbs from diet and exercise. I’ve read 10 new books. I’ve learned to live more within my means and most of all RC gave me a stock split that makes me feel better about my $300 buy in. \n\nThis leads me to my main point. I have a job interview tomorrow morning which I feel pretty confident about. My mentality has shifted to the realization that I have to go back to work next month. I have nothing of valuable to sell. My son starts Kindergarten next week. And GME isn’t going to take off until we are fully DRS’d.\n\nOr is it……..?\n\nI don’t know.
