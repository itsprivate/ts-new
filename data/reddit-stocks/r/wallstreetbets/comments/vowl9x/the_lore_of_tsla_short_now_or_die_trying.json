With you sitting alone at home priced in, we can focus on something you did not do for a long time now: **Make some fucking money.**\n\nBefore I share the trade of a century with you, we need to squeeze in a little history lesson. As your frontal lobes probably only fully developed in the last 12 months, you would not know what the fuck I am talking about otherwise. A word of caution tho: **this post is longer than the night you had to spend in daycare because your parents forget to pick you up.**\n\nSo get comfy, grab your favorite pacifier and let’s go.\n\n# Part 1: The lore of the electric Käfer\n\nSpool back to the start of 2018. A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the “(not so) secret master plan” of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot **harder and more complex than initially thought**. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c\n\nYou know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to “fuck off” more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‘ll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting\n\n&gt;“Humans are underrated”.\n\n**Heartwarming**.\n\nMind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it.\n\nTesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vaporware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f258dbbe09bcef58c6f58d154ccb7533b21007a5\n\nWhen things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, **this bombshell hit the wire:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/naua05dsax891.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b3f816b65fa17d6679f8689f76dd6ee767feb5b\n\n**If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it.**\n\nOur good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up TSLA bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1423b742449a10251d3ae1477b6df34cf8b5d7d3\n\nThe deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD.\n\n# Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts\n\nWe have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the “funding secured” tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, **we are now going to war.**\n\nAs you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful “luxury” car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver assist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. **They combine everything MBA’s are afraid of.**\n\n* Insanely capital intensive\n* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008)\n* Humongous unionized workforce\n* Stiff competition\n* Razor thin margins\n* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation)\n* Supply chains longer than the river Nile\n\nYou get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years.\n\n**No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are near damn impossible.**\n\nAs you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need.\n\nFamously, Railroads are really “Transportation” companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers.\n\n**That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don’t need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA’s darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP.**\n\nWhat comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who **loves** this kind of business?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nddze2sfyx891.png?width=1451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec09835151e77b3dd587617e7ba39c76a8fecdaf\n\nDamn right. **Warren Buffet.** The beloved godfather of predictable cash flows. So why don’t we take these attractive business models\n\n[Are you getting it?](https://preview.redd.it/67vg4z62bx891.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4cff05cd6cb87bf04a503781935fba4b2323df5)\n\nAnd cosplay as the messiah of capitalism. Enron pulled it off, why can’t we? **We just need to spin it into something so impossibly ambitious that people will actually believe it.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2nmy697bx891.png?width=1187&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7719be8585e97c1997cdd36879aa93c6c730997c\n\nIf you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. Full Self Driving was going to work next year and don’t bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins.\n\n**Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1g24y5zyx891.png?width=2373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aba28abe9b87c212b0db605dfef3cd33258caa7b\n\nAdd a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that. Just make sure that you have a **99.999% stock based compensation** plan with impossible hurdles that makes the board chuckle because you cannot possibly reach them. **EVER**.\n\n[Head of Tesla cheerleading team with her girls.](https://preview.redd.it/pk7jor6pbx891.png?width=1023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccad3cb3110df998b7d8fc0bb9e0f90b68c6f082)\n\nEnter 2020. After a short rally into February, **a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down**. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of Normandy, **this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.**\n\nEvery person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime. After some cautious easing attempts the Fed felt the need again to do something **BIG**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yklhnmzsbx891.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89d0338c512f32c687044abc1d9303ccacf9a7aa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part 3: Liftoff\n\nNow with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard.\n\n**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs, is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee.\n\n**So how do we fix the valuation?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1c622bf951276c25ac19a9a9d945d94e896b2c3\n\nAfter we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic ingredients for any  good bull story.  **Hype, momentum and FOMO.** Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?\n\n**You bet!** Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centerpiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. **Bubbles burst at these G-Forces.**\n\nThis market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a **baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kybobaavbx891.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae58e006a733b8ec9aab967aae15a42d50c74c50\n\n**Everyone, EVERYONE** was buying calls, **WSB** was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls.\n\nEven **Softbank** bought calls. The biggest and most Vapid unicorn VC. The poster child of dumb money. Usually the last stop before wonky unicorns raise the final round before going public or broke. Even they decided to decided to chip in. **And in a big way.**\n\n[A Billion Dollar VC fund suddenly gambling their portfolio money on call options is a bit unusual. ](https://preview.redd.it/ll1hhzzwbx891.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51f8a77613ac4d0463cbe5deaad7322127a9fd5d)\n\nThank you for your service! **Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was.**\n\nAll brought Tesla's valuation to the insane valuation of **1 Trillion USD.** We gave back some of these gains but **the valuation can still be described as “somewhat” lofty.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddg5aq6ybx891.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb4f2b91dfec490e7e282ad18bd05976240038cd\n\n# 4. The short the short shorts short\n\nI am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning.\n\n**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: “Never short Tesla”, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.**\n\nAs you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project.\n\n**And as we have learned, the market really can’t stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick.**\n\nFor reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change.\n\n[Lets look at the growth rate again. ](https://preview.redd.it/ltesnjnjsx891.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f49f1ebb746f2cd305807ce55821c15d9fc4a5f)\n\nI am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Tesla's remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market.\n\nSo, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market.\n\n**This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market.**\n\nThey know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e26zxgjayx891.png?width=1509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fc399243c95a7f9cb32988a2b27aa2c37c6e8bb\n\n**Let’s try to read a bit into the recent clues.**\n\n1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are “Giant Money Money furnaces” we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs.\n2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.\n3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated.\n4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious.\n5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars.\n6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months.\n7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending.\n8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4.\n9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let’s see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit.\n10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550.\n11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ⅓ stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now?\n12. The market is closed on Monday. If tomorrows numbers are bad, people might freak out as they can't get out anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to the $200-$400 range within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking?**\n\n* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow\n* Earnings are next month\n* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading.\n* Market is closed on Monday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Due to how shit the market is and the potential of bad news tomorrow and next month, shorting TESLA might get a haircut just like SHOP, AMZN and NFLX. It migth be a good way to make a quick buck now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I am in. How are we playing this?**\n\nIf you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, **you buy puts.** Depending on your personal risk tolerance **300 strike puts with 1 month DTE** look about right. If you want to play it safe, L**EAP puts for January ‘23 should get you going**. This is where I am at.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* **5x Jan 20 '23 140 Put**\n* **3x Jan 20 '23 300 Put**\n* **2x Jan 20 '23 400 Put**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:  Thank you for positions or ban, fucktards**\n\n[.](https://preview.redd.it/hdg8sl8h4z891.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86354b94ec672420b72bdff91042c2f22661f719)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, thank you for your time and stay safe out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Since this is a controversial topic, I have attached the following FAQ so that you don’t have to waste even more of your precious time in the comments.**\n\n**F:** Are you one of the princesses that panic sold your position in 2020 and never quite got over it?\n\n**A:** Yes\n\n**F:** Are you long term bullish on TSLA?\n\n**A:** 100%\n\n**F:** Will you go long shares?\n\n**A:** You bet!

With you sitting alone at home priced in, we can focus on something you did not do for a long time now: &lt;strong&gt;Make some fucking money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I share the trade of a century with you, we need to squeeze in a little history lesson. As your frontal lobes probably only fully developed in the last 12 months, you would not know what the fuck I am talking about otherwise. A word of caution tho: &lt;strong&gt;this post is longer than the night you had to spend in daycare because your parents forget to pick you up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So get comfy, grab your favorite pacifier and let’s go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Part 1: The lore of the electric Käfer&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spool back to the start of 2018. A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the “(not so) secret master plan” of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot &lt;strong&gt;harder and more complex than initially thought&lt;/strong&gt;. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to “fuck off” more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‘ll never know but it&amp;#39;s damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Humans are underrated”.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heartwarming&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vaporware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f258dbbe09bcef58c6f58d154ccb7533b21007a5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f258dbbe09bcef58c6f58d154ccb7533b21007a5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, &lt;strong&gt;this bombshell hit the wire:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/naua05dsax891.png?width=1184&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3b3f816b65fa17d6679f8689f76dd6ee767feb5b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/naua05dsax891.png?width=1184&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3b3f816b65fa17d6679f8689f76dd6ee767feb5b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up TSLA bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1423b742449a10251d3ae1477b6df34cf8b5d7d3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1423b742449a10251d3ae1477b6df34cf8b5d7d3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the “funding secured” tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, &lt;strong&gt;we are now going to war.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful “luxury” car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver assist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. &lt;strong&gt;They combine everything MBA’s are afraid of.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Insanely capital intensive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Humongous unionized workforce&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stiff competition&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Razor thin margins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supply chains longer than the river Nile&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are near damn impossible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Famously, Railroads are really “Transportation” companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don’t need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA’s darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who &lt;strong&gt;loves&lt;/strong&gt; this kind of business?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nddze2sfyx891.png?width=1451&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ec09835151e77b3dd587617e7ba39c76a8fecdaf\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/nddze2sfyx891.png?width=1451&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ec09835151e77b3dd587617e7ba39c76a8fecdaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Damn right. &lt;strong&gt;Warren Buffet.&lt;/strong&gt; The beloved godfather of predictable cash flows. So why don’t we take these attractive business models&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/67vg4z62bx891.png?width=1197&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b4cff05cd6cb87bf04a503781935fba4b2323df5\"&gt;Are you getting it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And cosplay as the messiah of capitalism. Enron pulled it off, why can’t we? &lt;strong&gt;We just need to spin it into something so impossibly ambitious that people will actually believe it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i2nmy697bx891.png?width=1187&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7719be8585e97c1997cdd36879aa93c6c730997c\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/i2nmy697bx891.png?width=1187&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7719be8585e97c1997cdd36879aa93c6c730997c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. Full Self Driving was going to work next year and don’t bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m1g24y5zyx891.png?width=2373&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aba28abe9b87c212b0db605dfef3cd33258caa7b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/m1g24y5zyx891.png?width=2373&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aba28abe9b87c212b0db605dfef3cd33258caa7b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that. Just make sure that you have a &lt;strong&gt;99.999% stock based compensation&lt;/strong&gt; plan with impossible hurdles that makes the board chuckle because you cannot possibly reach them. &lt;strong&gt;EVER&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pk7jor6pbx891.png?width=1023&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ccad3cb3110df998b7d8fc0bb9e0f90b68c6f082\"&gt;Head of Tesla cheerleading team with her girls.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enter 2020. After a short rally into February, &lt;strong&gt;a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down&lt;/strong&gt;. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of Normandy, &lt;strong&gt;this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime. After some cautious easing attempts the Fed felt the need again to do something &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yklhnmzsbx891.png?width=1172&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=89d0338c512f32c687044abc1d9303ccacf9a7aa\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/yklhnmzsbx891.png?width=1172&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=89d0338c512f32c687044abc1d9303ccacf9a7aa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Part 3: Liftoff&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember Kids&lt;/strong&gt;: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs, is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how do we fix the valuation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d1c622bf951276c25ac19a9a9d945d94e896b2c3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d1c622bf951276c25ac19a9a9d945d94e896b2c3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic ingredients for any  good bull story.  &lt;strong&gt;Hype, momentum and FOMO.&lt;/strong&gt; Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You bet!&lt;/strong&gt; Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centerpiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. &lt;strong&gt;Bubbles burst at these G-Forces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a &lt;strong&gt;baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kybobaavbx891.png?width=1172&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ae58e006a733b8ec9aab967aae15a42d50c74c50\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/kybobaavbx891.png?width=1172&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ae58e006a733b8ec9aab967aae15a42d50c74c50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone, EVERYONE&lt;/strong&gt; was buying calls, &lt;strong&gt;WSB&lt;/strong&gt; was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;strong&gt;Softbank&lt;/strong&gt; bought calls. The biggest and most Vapid unicorn VC. The poster child of dumb money. Usually the last stop before wonky unicorns raise the final round before going public or broke. Even they decided to decided to chip in. &lt;strong&gt;And in a big way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ll1hhzzwbx891.png?width=1211&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51f8a77613ac4d0463cbe5deaad7322127a9fd5d\"&gt;A Billion Dollar VC fund suddenly gambling their portfolio money on call options is a bit unusual. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your service! &lt;strong&gt;Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All brought Tesla&amp;#39;s valuation to the insane valuation of &lt;strong&gt;1 Trillion USD.&lt;/strong&gt; We gave back some of these gains but &lt;strong&gt;the valuation can still be described as “somewhat” lofty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ddg5aq6ybx891.png?width=1211&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eb4f2b91dfec490e7e282ad18bd05976240038cd\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ddg5aq6ybx891.png?width=1211&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eb4f2b91dfec490e7e282ad18bd05976240038cd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. The short the short shorts short&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it&amp;#39;s your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: “Never short Tesla”, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla&amp;#39;s bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And as we have learned, the market really can’t stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ltesnjnjsx891.png?width=1242&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4f49f1ebb746f2cd305807ce55821c15d9fc4a5f\"&gt;Lets look at the growth rate again. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Tesla&amp;#39;s remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e26zxgjayx891.png?width=1509&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3fc399243c95a7f9cb32988a2b27aa2c37c6e8bb\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/e26zxgjayx891.png?width=1509&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3fc399243c95a7f9cb32988a2b27aa2c37c6e8bb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s try to read a bit into the recent clues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are “Giant Money Money furnaces” we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let’s see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ⅓ stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The market is closed on Monday. If tomorrows numbers are bad, people might freak out as they can&amp;#39;t get out anymore.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to the $200-$400 range within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Delivery numbers are released tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Earnings are next month&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Market is closed on Monday.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to how shit the market is and the potential of bad news tomorrow and next month, shorting TESLA might get a haircut just like SHOP, AMZN and NFLX. It migth be a good way to make a quick buck now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am in. How are we playing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, &lt;strong&gt;you buy puts.&lt;/strong&gt; Depending on your personal risk tolerance &lt;strong&gt;300 strike puts with 1 month DTE&lt;/strong&gt; look about right. If you want to play it safe, L&lt;strong&gt;EAP puts for January ‘23 should get you going&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where I am at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5x Jan 20 &amp;#39;23 140 Put&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3x Jan 20 &amp;#39;23 300 Put&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2x Jan 20 &amp;#39;23 400 Put&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:  Thank you for positions or ban, fucktards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hdg8sl8h4z891.png?width=878&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=86354b94ec672420b72bdff91042c2f22661f719\"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, thank you for your time and stay safe out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: Since this is a controversial topic, I have attached the following FAQ so that you don’t have to waste even more of your precious time in the comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you one of the princesses that panic sold your position in 2020 and never quite got over it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you long term bullish on TSLA?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; 100%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F:&lt;/strong&gt; Will you go long shares?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; You bet!
