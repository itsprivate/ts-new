Could be worth your time in case you didn't know your history and also when everyone's bullish you gotta be careful. )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer :** Sasuke isn't here for at least 2 weeks because he is busy writing his last newsletter 11. Yes you heard it right the last coz we are ending this season. So this is me his friend the \"Illuminati Guy\" from whom he takes opinions regarding Stock Market. Tbh, Sasuke doesn't understand markets like i do. He is just better in T.A. stuffs. He is also not that confident while speaking as you might have observed in his recent talk over here on Wsb. \\*\\*Cough lot of 3.4%. Lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tl;dr :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[September = Trouble](https://preview.redd.it/20v52il1tvg91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8375b503cd85ad21796ce7335ad61b910226be1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So moving on :**\n\nI'm sure that title must have made you felt like a clickbait but i can assure it's not. We don't do these kind of stuff here. We leave that kind of stuff for Youtube guru's. What we do here is present you the data and what you should be prepared of in the upcoming months. So yes the stock market is about to collapse on the head of Democrats and the worst Fed chairman in history called \"Jerome Powell\". Powell if you're reading no hard feelings but you should resign. Seriously. \n\nGuys the government will soon blame this on wallstreetbets. I am not sure but they could come guns blazing out towards reddit to stop this community temporarily or forever if the stock market crashes pretty bad in upcoming \"Bearish September\". They pressure companies like Meta, Google, Amazon Microsoft and Apple so what's stopping them to go after Reddit. Just so you know guys i love every single one of you. Whether you hate me or resent me wont change my feelings towards each and every one of you. Personally i believe Reddit should go public by 2029 :) It is such a wonderful platform.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo guys enough chit chart lets dive in this what i call the \"Illuminati data\" on stock market crash that will make your mind blown part. Are you ready ? If yes then lets beginnnnnnn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Stock Market Collapse Analysis \n\n**( When Everyone's bullish that's when you have to be extra Careful )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/597345flavg91.png?width=1598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06b0d37b6e835027c2e7f4cb024cb8bb847a9524\n\n\"Dude what is even this ? \" \"I'm not joining your cult\" \"Get back to your meds\" Guys guys guys have a bit of patience. Please. It's not what you think. Allow me to explain this very important concept called \"Shmita\" before we actually dive in the data. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So what exactly is Shmita ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Don't get confused with your sabbatical year after school. Lol](https://preview.redd.it/wui6d5lcavg91.png?width=1806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cda75d81d57399063e8618e2404f53862a2b1cf7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring Shmita there are the rise of empires, the fall of empires, the beginning of wars, the ending of wars and the financial collapse. Almost all of the financial collapse occur during Shmita year. So let's look at past 100 yr where all Shmita year have been impacted financially. \n\nHere we will be discussing political, economic and financial collapse all the way back to the signing of declaration of independence and the beginning of revolutionary war. So guys i'm sure the teacher of your school must have taught you history so well. So i will try to keep it concise and just give you few flashbacks from your history class. You can read about them in depth later on and please fact check them.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here's the data** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. 1777 : Declaration of Independence signed. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n2. 1783 : Revolutionary began after Independence and ended in 1783. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n3. 1846 : Mexican american war began. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n4. 1861 : Civil war began. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n5. 1873 : Black Friday on 9th May at Vienna Stock Exchange. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n6. 1896 : Panic of 1896 in depth of Economic Depression. (Heart of Shmita yr)\n7. 1903 : Panic of 1903. (End of Shmita yr)\n8. 1917 : World War 1 &amp; Russian Romanov family Empire collapsed. (Last month of Shmita yr) \n9. 1931 : Dow collapsed 88% ushering Great Depression. (End of Shmita yr)\n10. 1938 : Still in Great depression stock market collapsed another 50% after it had risen ushering in a Severe Recession. (End of Shmita yr)\n11. 1945 : WW2 ended. Austria Germany Japan Poland were in ruins. (End of Shmita yr)\n12. 1966 : Stock market collapse of 1966. (End of Shmita yr)\n13. 1973 : Stock market crash of 1973. (End of Shmita yr)\n14. 1979 : Collapse begin and went until 1982. Oil prices peaked and there were gasoline shortages.\n15. 1987 : Stock market crashed 33% on Black Monday. (End of Shmita yr)\n16. 1994 : Bond market collapsed. (End of Shmita yr)\n17. 2001 : Attack on World Trade Center. (End of Shmita yr) Stock market closed and reopened on September 17 and dropped -7% on last day of Shmita yr.\n18. 2008 : Largest stock market loss in history i.e. 777 points. (Occurred on last day Sept 29th. End of Shmita yr)\n19. 2015 : Shanghai stock market crashed 30% in three weeks. (During the heart of Shmita yr)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink for top 10 crash :  \n\n[https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/12/the-top-10-biggest-market-crashes/](https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/12/the-top-10-biggest-market-crashes/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Note :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The difference is usually b/w 6 to 7. \n* \"Crashes\" were called \"Panic\" in history.\n* At the beginning of history we collapsed at the beginning of Shmita year but later on it was usually at the end of the \"Shmita\" year and mostly around September. Hence September is the worst month in history.  \n\n\n[Calculate September returns. xD](https://preview.redd.it/h4qwk5nvqvg91.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1096791888e69d2e8f4e93fbcbc7c61939be4eb1)\n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result :**\n\nIn 2022 exactly seven years after, the stock market of United States or could be United Kingdom ( As these two have high inflation. Hey could be China as well ) will get obliterated before the end of Shmita year. Currently we are approaching the end of Shmita year. \n\nThis Shmita year began in \"September 2021\" and will end on \"September 25th 2022\". So prepare yourself for a collapse and please don't say afterwards you weren't warned before. As for people working in institutions and hedge funds you probably must have had a nice talk about this at lunch didn't you.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Additional Context :**\n\nToday is what 9th august 1947 we are 47 days away from end of Shmita year. Btw guys this is not only a Shmita year ( The seventh year in a cycle ) but this year is also known as \"Super Shmita\" year                 (Everything bubble collapse xD) which is the seventh year of seven \"7 year\" cycle. \n\nSo its the 49th year and of course this occurs every 49 yrs. Hence it has heightened importance on Jewish calendar. You maybe thinking this is all weird. I ain't believing this hocus pocus and thinking \"What has letting land rest and forgiving debts have to do with all of this\". \n\nGuys just see the chronicles of events. The beginning of wars, Ending of wars, Financial stock market, bond market going back couple of hundred years. They seems to correlate and i don't know why. They just do. It's not like i'm BS'ing you. I just read you the data which you could find on your own. Even Peter lynch and Warren buffet talk about all of this. \n\nWatch one of Peter Lynch seminar in 1991 where he talked about the most important thing that everyone should especially GenZ need to know about stock market in last 100 year. Stock Market go up in value and they go down in value. And when they go down they can go down a lot. He further adds in last 100 years stock market had 51 corrections of 10% and more. That means every 2 year there is a correction. And out of these 51 corrections 15 had crashes of 20% or more. That means roughly 7 year out of 100 year you get a severe crash. So guys all i wanna say is you don't have to time it but you gotta position yourself just in case. Coz that's the most important job of every traders and investors.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions :**\n\nSo guys i cannot give you my positions but hey i will send you the Uchiha positions. He might have talked about this in his guest appearance here on Wsb. Lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Emerging market short coz he cannot do puts on USA.](https://preview.redd.it/crdumae4svg91.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73122c3c771285de2c25d5037a6b8b0e0b6c8a6b)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhqk6fe4svg91.jpg?width=1069&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8c345610b2679026927d9e3f296ffcb49f3a6ed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lpqrfae4svg91.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1583beb0d0c07c17d0251615605da90299dba6e\n\nSo\n\nInvestors : You buy massively at vix 40+ or hedge a lil bit portion of your portfolio.  \nTraders : You buy 2m puts till oct 29 in case to be safe. If you wanna go aggressive go buy it for sept 29. But please dont blow your whole money. Just a small portion of it.  \n\n\nWe have already given you dates in WS-10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nJust remember it isn't precise. It doesn't happen exactly in the last month or last week or last day exactly. But it usually happens in \"Shmita\" year and more often than not it does occur in last month toward the end of \"Shmita\" year.\n\nI'm not here to scare you or be negative. I'm just here coz Uchiha has gone somewhere and he basically told me to write something interesting. I'm your guy who inform and prepare you for what has happened historically. ( I just tell him and he tells you )  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Invalidation :**\n\nThis Sept 2021- Sept 2022 if you look back from the future let's say 2029 ( End of Shmita yr. xD ) that this year was indeed Shmita year and maybe the collapse occurred in first 6 months of this yr and maybe the fact that stocks and bonds collapsed during 6m period would make it unusual and stand out as reset or collapse. This is what will be then called as collapse in the \"Heart of Shmita yr\" ( We exceeded more than 20% crash )  \n\n\nOr Perhaps i could be right and  \n\n\nIn the next 47 days we are looking to a period of time where we will have a greater collapse in front of us.\n\n  \n\n\n**Advise For :**\n\nThis advise perhaps is best for financial advisor managing an active portfolio and for people who hire a IA. So if your guy hasn't told you about all of this. Fire him immediately.  \n\n\nPersonally i love history and believe in historical cycles. Hence that June 15 bottom was such a fabulous entry but this Sasuke man. He wasn't convinced enough and flip flopped. Feel Sorry for him duh.  \n\n\nIt breaks my heart that these kind of information will never be covered by Bloomberg, Cnbc or some other popular websites because it has certain religious component to it. But its important to take a note of this since the correlation is just incredible.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-x-x-x-x-x-x-x--x-x-x-xx-x--x-xx--x-xx-x-x--xx--x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all i have to say guys. I know i know you must be thinking Cpi is coming down and the report is so good. Therefore i'm posting this bearish post in a market where everyone suddenly thinks its A-okay and we are going for a new bull market. But i still have to believe we could be shaping up for a collapse by Sept 25. Hey, at least a double bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith lots of love guys. I bid my farewell. I also made a short video for you guys. Keep an eye on it when it releases :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you\n\nRegards\n\nItachi",

Yes you heard it right the last coz we are ending this season. So this is me his friend the &amp;quot;Illuminati Guy&amp;quot; from whom he takes opinions regarding Stock Market. Tbh, Sasuke doesn&amp;#39;t understand markets like i do. He is just better in T.A. stuffs. He is also not that confident while speaking as you might have observed in his recent talk over here on Wsb. **Cough lot of 3.4%. Lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;dr :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/20v52il1tvg91.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b8375b503cd85ad21796ce7335ad61b910226be1\"&gt;September = Trouble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So moving on :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure that title must have made you felt like a clickbait but i can assure it&amp;#39;s not. We don&amp;#39;t do these kind of stuff here. We leave that kind of stuff for Youtube guru&amp;#39;s. What we do here is present you the data and what you should be prepared of in the upcoming months. So yes the stock market is about to collapse on the head of Democrats and the worst Fed chairman in history called &amp;quot;Jerome Powell&amp;quot;. Powell if you&amp;#39;re reading no hard feelings but you should resign. Seriously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guys the government will soon blame this on wallstreetbets. I am not sure but they could come guns blazing out towards reddit to stop this community temporarily or forever if the stock market crashes pretty bad in upcoming &amp;quot;Bearish September&amp;quot;. They pressure companies like Meta, Google, Amazon Microsoft and Apple so what&amp;#39;s stopping them to go after Reddit. Just so you know guys i love every single one of you. Whether you hate me or resent me wont change my feelings towards each and every one of you. Personally i believe Reddit should go public by 2029 :) It is such a wonderful platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So guys enough chit chart lets dive in this what i call the &amp;quot;Illuminati data&amp;quot; on stock market crash that will make your mind blown part. Are you ready ? If yes then lets beginnnnnnn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Stock Market Collapse Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;( When Everyone&amp;#39;s bullish that&amp;#39;s when you have to be extra Careful )&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/597345flavg91.png?width=1598&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=06b0d37b6e835027c2e7f4cb024cb8bb847a9524\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/597345flavg91.png?width=1598&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=06b0d37b6e835027c2e7f4cb024cb8bb847a9524&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dude what is even this ? &amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not joining your cult&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Get back to your meds&amp;quot; Guys guys guys have a bit of patience. Please. It&amp;#39;s not what you think. Allow me to explain this very important concept called &amp;quot;Shmita&amp;quot; before we actually dive in the data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what exactly is Shmita ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wui6d5lcavg91.png?width=1806&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cda75d81d57399063e8618e2404f53862a2b1cf7\"&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get confused with your sabbatical year after school.

(During the heart of Shmita yr)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Link for top 10 crash :  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/12/the-top-10-biggest-market-crashes/\"&gt;https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/12/the-top-10-biggest-market-crashes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The difference is usually b/w 6 to 7. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Crashes&amp;quot; were called &amp;quot;Panic&amp;quot; in history.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At the beginning of history we collapsed at the beginning of Shmita year but later on it was usually at the end of the &amp;quot;Shmita&amp;quot; year and mostly around September. Hence September is the worst month in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h4qwk5nvqvg91.png?width=787&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1096791888e69d2e8f4e93fbcbc7c61939be4eb1\"&gt;Calculate September returns. xD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2022 exactly seven years after, the stock market of United States or could be United Kingdom ( As these two have high inflation. Hey could be China as well ) will get obliterated before the end of Shmita year. Currently we are approaching the end of Shmita year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Shmita year began in &amp;quot;September 2021&amp;quot; and will end on &amp;quot;September 25th 2022&amp;quot;. So prepare yourself for a collapse and please don&amp;#39;t say afterwards you weren&amp;#39;t warned before. As for people working in institutions and hedge funds you probably must have had a nice talk about this at lunch didn&amp;#39;t you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Context :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today is what 9th august 1947 we are 47 days away from end of Shmita year. Btw guys this is not only a Shmita year ( The seventh year in a cycle ) but this year is also known as &amp;quot;Super Shmita&amp;quot; year                 (Everything bubble collapse xD) which is the seventh year of seven &amp;quot;7 year&amp;quot; cycle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So its the 49th year and of course this occurs every 49 yrs. Hence it has heightened importance on Jewish calendar. You maybe thinking this is all weird. I ain&amp;#39;t believing this hocus pocus and thinking &amp;quot;What has letting land rest and forgiving debts have to do with all of this&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guys just see the chronicles of events. The beginning of wars, Ending of wars, Financial stock market, bond market going back couple of hundred years. They seems to correlate and i don&amp;#39;t know why. They just do. It&amp;#39;s not like i&amp;#39;m BS&amp;#39;ing you. I just read you the data which you could find on your own. Even Peter lynch and Warren buffet talk about all of this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch one of Peter Lynch seminar in 1991 where he talked about the most important thing that everyone should especially GenZ need to know about stock market in last 100 year. Stock Market go up in value and they go down in value. And when they go down they can go down a lot. He further adds in last 100 years stock market had 51 corrections of 10% and more. That means every 2 year there is a correction. And out of these 51 corrections 15 had crashes of 20% or more. That means roughly 7 year out of 100 year you get a severe crash. So guys all i wanna say is you don&amp;#39;t have to time it but you gotta position yourself just in case. Coz that&amp;#39;s the most important job of every traders and investors.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So guys i cannot give you my positions but hey i will send you the Uchiha positions. He might have talked about this in his guest appearance here on Wsb. Lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/crdumae4svg91.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=73122c3c771285de2c25d5037a6b8b0e0b6c8a6b\"&gt;Emerging market short coz he cannot do puts on USA.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fhqk6fe4svg91.jpg?width=1069&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a8c345610b2679026927d9e3f296ffcb49f3a6ed\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/fhqk6fe4svg91.jpg?width=1069&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a8c345610b2679026927d9e3f296ffcb49f3a6ed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lpqrfae4svg91.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e1583beb0d0c07c17d0251615605da90299dba6e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/lpqrfae4svg91.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e1583beb0d0c07c17d0251615605da90299dba6e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investors : You buy massively at vix 40+ or hedge a lil bit portion of your portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;\nTraders : You buy 2m puts till oct 29 in case to be safe. If you wanna go aggressive go buy it for sept 29. But please dont blow your whole money. Just a small portion of it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have already given you dates in WS-10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember it isn&amp;#39;t precise. It doesn&amp;#39;t happen exactly in the last month or last week or last day exactly. But it usually happens in &amp;quot;Shmita&amp;quot; year and more often than not it does occur in last month toward the end of &amp;quot;Shmita&amp;quot; year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not here to scare you or be negative. I&amp;#39;m just here coz Uchiha has gone somewhere and he basically told me to write something interesting. I&amp;#39;m your guy who inform and prepare you for what has happened historically. ( I just tell him and he tells you )  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invalidation :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Sept 2021- Sept 2022 if you look back from the future let&amp;#39;s say 2029 ( End of Shmita yr. xD ) that this year was indeed Shmita year and maybe the collapse occurred in first 6 months of this yr and maybe the fact that stocks and bonds collapsed during 6m period would make it unusual and stand out as reset or collapse. This is what will be then called as collapse in the &amp;quot;Heart of Shmita yr&amp;quot; ( We exceeded more than 20% crash )  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Perhaps i could be right and  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the next 47 days we are looking to a period of time where we will have a greater collapse in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advise For :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This advise perhaps is best for financial advisor managing an active portfolio and for people who hire a IA. So if your guy hasn&amp;#39;t told you about all of this. Fire him immediately.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally i love history and believe in historical cycles. Hence that June 15 bottom was such a fabulous entry but this Sasuke man. He wasn&amp;#39;t convinced enough and flip flopped. Feel Sorry for him duh.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It breaks my heart that these kind of information will never be covered by Bloomberg, Cnbc or some other popular websites because it has certain religious component to it. But its important to take a note of this since the correlation is just incredible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-x-x-x-x-x-x-x--x-x-x-xx-x--x-xx--x-xx-x-x--xx--x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all i have to say guys. I know i know you must be thinking Cpi is coming down and the report is so good. Therefore i&amp;#39;m posting this bearish post in a market where everyone suddenly thinks its A-okay and we are going for a new bull market. But i still have to believe we could be shaping up for a collapse by Sept 25. Hey, at least a double bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With lots of love guys. I bid my farewell. I also made a short video for you guys. Keep an eye on it when it releases :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Itachi&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
