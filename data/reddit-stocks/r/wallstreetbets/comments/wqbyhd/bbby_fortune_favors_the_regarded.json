I'm sure there's a Melvin Capital 2.0 who's looking to blow up his fund and career. You've been warned. Apes are coming for you, and your stupid little fund is going through a tsunami of redemptions. Then you'll get to deal with a divorce, fire sale of your Aspen home, and eventually end up as a fry cook next to yours truly. End of day, [there's only 100K shares left to short](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/BBBY), and if you can manage to send an electrical signal between the lone crease in your brain, you'll deduce that Melvin 2.0 took up 200K shares today.\n\nWhat else happened? Some whale decided to use his giant fuckin dong as a wrecking ball and dumped his entire holding of $BBBY dropping the price from \\~$27 down to \\~$20. That's right, [Freeman Capital Holdings dumped a position worth \\~6% of $BBBY](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16351/html). And to top it off, I might have caught a glimpse of the fuck nugget with the $27K loan suffer a heart attack. You didn't know whether to clutch your heart or phone and you ended up dropping the 2 day old tornado and 64oz soda at the kum n go service station.\n\nDespite the fuckery and bullshit, the stock finished green 30%. Let me repeat that slowly enough for your smooth brain one more time.  The stock still finished GREEN 30%. Keep your chin up regard. I'm telling you there's a reason to smile and be optimistic, even though you don't have the slightest fuckin clue what is going on. Tomorrow is a new day. Fortune favors the regarded.",
