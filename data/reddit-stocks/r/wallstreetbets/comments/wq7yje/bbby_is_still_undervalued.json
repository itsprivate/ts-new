I know how you people get after a long day of staring at 2 colors for 6:30 hours straight instead of doing your fucking job so I'm going to start off nice and easy with this DD to lightly wrinky those smooth brains of yours, before moving to actual technical analysis to put more folds in your brain than Bezos has in his wallet.\n\nThe one question I keep seeing people ask when it comes to BBBY is \"Can it go any higher?\" Everyone seems so fucking confused on this simple point when the answer is a very VERY obvious: **No shit it can go higher.**\n\n# Can BBBY Go Higher?\n\nThe simple answer is no duh, any stock can go higher or lower. The only limit to how high a stock can go is literally how much money JPOW can print at a given point. The future is unknown and anyone fuckstick on the internet that tells you they know the future is either lying to you, Jim Cramer, or possibly both.\n\nThe future is unknown, but when it comes to pricing we have plenty of data from the past that says **Yes, BBBY can go much, much higher.**\n\nLook! I even have proof:\n\n[As of right now BBBY isn't anywhere close to it's all time high of $79.98](https://preview.redd.it/o33prhdzz4i91.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65c4e456ad1cfe680a79ba229ee67e87e8930a02)\n\n[It's nowhere close to its five year high of $35.20](https://preview.redd.it/mdmmtidzz4i91.png?width=1688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef8be25a295981ec12138c8e0b63136b6729254f)\n\n[It didn't even touch it's one year high of 29.10](https://preview.redd.it/nm525gdzz4i91.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2918d02bc494b0609a503f1f971cb1d99747ac)\n\n[It hasn't even beaten it's high price of the last 6 fucking months](https://preview.redd.it/0xmb6fdzz4i91.png?width=1688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f261d28b1c6b89b0b2bf4ca6a070cc33b4d1c8a5)\n\n[And \\(most importantly\\) ITS NOT EVEN AT THE HIGH PRICE OF TODAY](https://preview.redd.it/xwgfzqwc05i91.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d6c958daf2d0d8269f5629fd104c551b9201987)\n\nSo i'm hoping i didn't lose any of you there on that advanced piece of analysis that it was literally 30% higher today so no shit it can go higher. **In fact, compared to some of the gains the company has made over the years, this week's gains aren't even that big of an anomaly. We're still in the normal realm of BBBY - the common beyond if you will.** So please go back to munching your Denny's placemat and stop asking this question over and over. It's not the important question.\n\nWhat we want to know is how high can we expect a short squeeze to take BBBY and how likely is one to occur?\n\n# How High Can A Squeeze Take Us?\n\nAgain we're going to keep this pretty fucking easy right now with an argument that is barely even mathematically sound but follow along if you will, my highly regarded apes, as we compare what we're seeing now with the GME short squeeze of 2021. First off, how much did GME grow during it's amazing run?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A table of historical data for Jan 2021 - showing the largest increase over the 2 week period being 1500&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/v227o60475i91.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef934f6a722eeb9463aa14aea3e0a57fd63bee8)\n\nSo over the 2 week peak squeezer that GME received in 2021 stocks went up 15x. If you want to go not far back from there to when prices were $2.53 a share and compare it to the absolute peak of $483 a share you're looking at 190x increase.\n\nWhat's important to note though is that most publications don't even consider the squeeze to have started until it hit the $19 price point - but like we just said just months earlier it was $2.50 a share meaning that it was already up almost 8x. **To the average investor engaged in the squeeze, an 8x increase could have been good enough. Some nay sayers could have said \"The squeeze has already squozen\" and squelched off with their gains - leaving the full 190x gains they could have had on the table.** But like we said already - no one knows the future do they?\n\nNow lets take a look at what has already happened with BBBY:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Taking a look at the last month's worth of data you can see it's jumped from around $5.81 to $16 - slightly less than 3x gains](https://preview.redd.it/eswsuqly95i91.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d318d657d9e3f90fda2f60e24f801bf525ea6838)\n\nNow look at our current situation and compare it to the GME situation. BBBY all time low for the last 3 months is about $4.51 a share compared to today's all time high of about $28 – **about an 8x increase over the course of a couple months.** Are you seeing what i'm getting at here?\n\nOver the last few months including the gains we saw today we have witnessed what amounts to almost exactly the same gains as GME pre-squeeze. I repeat: we're witnessing historically **PRE-SQUEEZE** levels of gains. And that's not even including the fact that we're currently down 30% from today's all time high meaning we're actually at about 4.5x gains meaning we're due almost twice the gains before the squeeze even starts.\n\nStill don't believe me? Here they are overlayed:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[See that orange one? Thats the one we want.](https://preview.redd.it/esiwe8and5i91.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672e893317188aa511648b2d3fef5006083c75cf)\n\nNow am i saying that BBBY will end up anywhere near what GME had? Most likely not - when GME was short squeezed, 140% of the float was squeezed. BBBY is sitting on around 50%. I will say this though, if you're still chasing GME and Popcorn and other symbols trying to make them squeeze still **BBBY's is the highest well hyped stock on the market right now** with GME at a mere %22.39 of the float while popcorn is at %18.40\n\nThis accounts for what we might see when it comes to a short squeeze with BBBY but it doesn't answer if it's likely that it will squeeze. For that we turn to the most important index when determining short squeeze likelihood - the LREN index\n\n# The Most Important Predictor A Short Squeeze Is About To Happen\n\nThat's right folks now it's time for the meat and potatoes of the this DD - the LREN index. Many economists are skeptical about LREN's ability to confirm that billions of dollars are about to be made let me assure you it's been a leading indicator in every trade i've made since getting serious about trading.\n\nI'm talking of course about the LaughRiot Erect Nipple index and i'm please to inform the readers that have made it this far that my nips have not been this aroused about a stock since the GME 2021.\n\nSure some may say that my erect nipples are a poor way to track retail excitement for a stock. Other Wall Street \"insiders\" might say that my supple male milk nobs are a poor analog for other more reliable indices like **Total Trade Volume which has been 21.5x higher than it's daily average** or **Total Call Volume outstripping Total Put Volume by over 2x.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Unusual options trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/3o296prbk5i91.png?width=3218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bc5aca72d6a44b25b61edac8affcf5189c5f22c)\n\nAll of these things pale in comparison to just how erect my nipples are at the moment being on this sub with all of you tendie tasters. And really that does matter because what truly made the last short squeeze go was the Apes in this sub hyping each other up until they put their entire life savings into a company that will buy your physical video games for 1/5th what you paid for them. It was retail's hype that made that squeeze happen and i haven't seen this sub this hyped in years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My nips at the present time](https://preview.redd.it/bwvpxgr6l5i91.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c73023a5285d9a063bd9133108124dcda6406d27)\n\nThank you all for reading. None of this qualifies as financial advice, BBBY to $80 by EoW, and i just like the stock (evidenced above).",

  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright my highly regarded crayon munchers, markets are closed and school is in session. I know how you people get after a long day of staring at 2 colors for 6:30 hours straight instead of doing your fucking job so I&amp;#39;m going to start off nice and easy with this DD to lightly wrinky those smooth brains of yours, before moving to actual technical analysis to put more folds in your brain than Bezos has in his wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one question I keep seeing people ask when it comes to BBBY is &amp;quot;Can it go any higher?&amp;quot; Everyone seems so fucking confused on this simple point when the answer is a very VERY obvious: &lt;strong&gt;No shit it can go higher.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Can BBBY Go Higher?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is no duh, any stock can go higher or lower. The only limit to how high a stock can go is literally how much money JPOW can print at a given point. The future is unknown and anyone fuckstick on the internet that tells you they know the future is either lying to you, Jim Cramer, or possibly both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The future is unknown, but when it comes to pricing we have plenty of data from the past that says &lt;strong&gt;Yes, BBBY can go much, much higher.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look! I even have proof:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o33prhdzz4i91.png?width=1692&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=65c4e456ad1cfe680a79ba229ee67e87e8930a02\"&gt;As of right now BBBY isn&amp;#39;t anywhere close to it&amp;#39;s all time high of $79.98&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mdmmtidzz4i91.png?width=1688&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ef8be25a295981ec12138c8e0b63136b6729254f\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s nowhere close to its five year high of $35.20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nm525gdzz4i91.png?width=1692&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0b2918d02bc494b0609a503f1f971cb1d99747ac\"&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t even touch it&amp;#39;s one year high of 29.10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0xmb6fdzz4i91.png?width=1688&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f261d28b1c6b89b0b2bf4ca6a070cc33b4d1c8a5\"&gt;It hasn&amp;#39;t even beaten it&amp;#39;s high price of the last 6 fucking months&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xwgfzqwc05i91.png?width=1692&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9d6c958daf2d0d8269f5629fd104c551b9201987\"&gt;And (most importantly) ITS NOT EVEN AT THE HIGH PRICE OF TODAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So i&amp;#39;m hoping i didn&amp;#39;t lose any of you there on that advanced piece of analysis that it was literally 30% higher today so no shit it can go higher. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, compared to some of the gains the company has made over the years, this week&amp;#39;s gains aren&amp;#39;t even that big of an anomaly. We&amp;#39;re still in the normal realm of BBBY - the common beyond if you will.&lt;/strong&gt; So please go back to munching your Denny&amp;#39;s placemat and stop asking this question over and over. It&amp;#39;s not the important question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we want to know is how high can we expect a short squeeze to take BBBY and how likely is one to occur?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How High Can A Squeeze Take Us?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again we&amp;#39;re going to keep this pretty fucking easy right now with an argument that is barely even mathematically sound but follow along if you will, my highly regarded apes, as we compare what we&amp;#39;re seeing now with the GME short squeeze of 2021. First off, how much did GME grow during it&amp;#39;s amazing run?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v227o60475i91.png?width=850&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8ef934f6a722eeb9463aa14aea3e0a57fd63bee8\"&gt;A table of historical data for Jan 2021 - showing the largest increase over the 2 week period being 1500&amp;#37;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So over the 2 week peak squeezer that GME received in 2021 stocks went up 15x. If you want to go not far back from there to when prices were $2.53 a share and compare it to the absolute peak of $483 a share you&amp;#39;re looking at 190x increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s important to note though is that most publications don&amp;#39;t even consider the squeeze to have started until it hit the $19 price point - but like we just said just months earlier it was $2.50 a share meaning that it was already up almost 8x. &lt;strong&gt;To the average investor engaged in the squeeze, an 8x increase could have been good enough. Some nay sayers could have said &amp;quot;The squeeze has already squozen&amp;quot; and squelched off with their gains - leaving the full 190x gains they could have had on the table.&lt;/strong&gt; But like we said already - no one knows the future do they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now lets take a look at what has already happened with BBBY:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eswsuqly95i91.png?width=1436&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d318d657d9e3f90fda2f60e24f801bf525ea6838\"&gt;Taking a look at the last month&amp;#39;s worth of data you can see it&amp;#39;s jumped from around $5.81 to $16 - slightly less than 3x gains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now look at our current situation and compare it to the GME situation. BBBY all time low for the last 3 months is about $4.51 a share compared to today&amp;#39;s all time high of about $28 – &lt;strong&gt;about an 8x increase over the course of a couple months.&lt;/strong&gt; Are you seeing what i&amp;#39;m getting at here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months including the gains we saw today we have witnessed what amounts to almost exactly the same gains as GME pre-squeeze. I repeat: we&amp;#39;re witnessing historically &lt;strong&gt;PRE-SQUEEZE&lt;/strong&gt; levels of gains. And that&amp;#39;s not even including the fact that we&amp;#39;re currently down 30% from today&amp;#39;s all time high meaning we&amp;#39;re actually at about 4.5x gains meaning we&amp;#39;re due almost twice the gains before the squeeze even starts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still don&amp;#39;t believe me? Here they are overlayed:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/esiwe8and5i91.png?width=1366&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=672e893317188aa511648b2d3fef5006083c75cf\"&gt;See that orange one? Thats the one we want.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now am i saying that BBBY will end up anywhere near what GME had? Most likely not - when GME was short squeezed, 140% of the float was squeezed. BBBY is sitting on around 50%. I will say this though, if you&amp;#39;re still chasing GME and Popcorn and other symbols trying to make them squeeze still &lt;strong&gt;BBBY&amp;#39;s is the highest well hyped stock on the market right now&lt;/strong&gt; with GME at a mere %22.39 of the float while popcorn is at %18.40&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This accounts for what we might see when it comes to a short squeeze with BBBY but it doesn&amp;#39;t answer if it&amp;#39;s likely that it will squeeze. For that we turn to the most important index when determining short squeeze likelihood - the LREN index&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Most Important Predictor A Short Squeeze Is About To Happen&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s right folks now it&amp;#39;s time for the meat and potatoes of the this DD - the LREN index. Many economists are skeptical about LREN&amp;#39;s ability to confirm that billions of dollars are about to be made let me assure you it&amp;#39;s been a leading indicator in every trade i&amp;#39;ve made since getting serious about trading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m talking of course about the LaughRiot Erect Nipple index and i&amp;#39;m please to inform the readers that have made it this far that my nips have not been this aroused about a stock since the GME 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure some may say that my erect nipples are a poor way to track retail excitement for a stock. Other Wall Street &amp;quot;insiders&amp;quot; might say that my supple male milk nobs are a poor analog for other more reliable indices like &lt;strong&gt;Total Trade Volume which has been 21.5x higher than it&amp;#39;s daily average&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Total Call Volume outstripping Total Put Volume by over 2x.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3o296prbk5i91.png?width=3218&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6bc5aca72d6a44b25b61edac8affcf5189c5f22c\"&gt;Unusual options trading volume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these things pale in comparison to just how erect my nipples are at the moment being on this sub with all of you tendie tasters. And really that does matter because what truly made the last short squeeze go was the Apes in this sub hyping each other up until they put their entire life savings into a company that will buy your physical video games for 1/5th what you paid for them. It was retail&amp;#39;s hype that made that squeeze happen and i haven&amp;#39;t seen this sub this hyped in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bwvpxgr6l5i91.png?width=478&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c73023a5285d9a063bd9133108124dcda6406d27\"&gt;My nips at the present time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for reading. None of this qualifies as financial advice, BBBY to $80 by EoW, and i just like the stock (evidenced above).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
