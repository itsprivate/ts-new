  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi Fam, its me, Fam. </p>\n\n<p>There is something going on with GME and it may be  <strong>imminent</strong>\nThis is my interpretation of GME thru wave counting/elliotwave. </p>\n\n<p>Refer to this image first : <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/CR0OiQJ.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/CR0OiQJ.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>From a yearly point of view, we have accomplished wave 1(A) and wave 2(B) colored blue for those colored blind (idk how that works). We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a <em>test</em> to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the <strong>BIGGEST</strong> wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several <em>mini</em> resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can <em>predict where Wave 3 may end</em> and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) </p>\n\n<p>Refer to image: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/cw86Lhx.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/cw86Lhx.jpg</a>\nThis image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). </p>\n\n<p>On the daily,\n* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start\n* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves\n* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. </p>\n\n<p>If this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Wave 3&#39;s forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels. </p>\n\n<p>Im not a financially literate to be a financial advisor, but just shooting blanks, i think. My mom told me I lost a chromosome when she was dividing me during meiosis (not mitosis per SFWsosa93)  phase.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: LOOK AT IT GO! ITS literally erection time.  (40 mins past close)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
