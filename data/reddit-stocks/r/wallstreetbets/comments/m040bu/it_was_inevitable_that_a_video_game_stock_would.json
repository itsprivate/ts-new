I may have eaten too many yellow crayons I thought were bananas this week (Or was I trying to eat yellow crayons but ate bananas? Idr) but I think I stumbled onto something.</p>\n\n<p>Most people on this sub are Millenials (speculation). Most Millenials grew up playing video games. We have a passion for them. But we never really picked up a lot of practical skills from playing video games. <em>Until now</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As we all know, Robinhood and similar apps <strong>game-ified</strong> investing. They made cool colors to show us how we did. It&#39;s not enough to show green and red on the app so the entire fucking screen has to be colored so we know what the fuck is going on. So we could say &quot;Ohhhh green good red bad.&quot; It&#39;s like the slot machine except, unlike slots, investing odds can be changed by doing work. Nobody used to do the work, but now that all the work is on the phone--the same device we have been using to play the game--it still feels like part of the game. </p>\n\n<p>So we do some research and now we actually have a leg up in the game. It&#39;s like when you play StarCraft and you suck but then you read an article on how to not suck at StarCraft. Well, we read posts on GME and we sucked less at predicting the movement on that stock. </p>\n\n<p>Why are video games even fun? None of it is real. But it&#39;s a <strong>shared</strong> experience that you can have with your friends and peers, or, at the very least, discuss with them. It&#39;s the consensus that something cool happened on a screen that makes games fun on a social level, even though it&#39;s all fake. Well none of the money movements we see on the screen are real. Sure, it&#39;s all documented, but it&#39;s still virtual. Nobody&#39;s going to your bank and moving cash into RH&#39;s bank. This all works because we all agree that it works.</p>\n\n<p>Now get a bunch of apes to play the game after reading the rules and even, for some of us, practicing, and you&#39;ve got the beginning of a movement to a new era of trading and investing.</p>\n\n<p>Am I making any sense or am I insane even for a WSBer?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wow guys! Thank you! I have never received awards before!! I like rockets because I think they are food colored bananas!!! 🚀🚀🚀🍌 🍌 🍌</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
