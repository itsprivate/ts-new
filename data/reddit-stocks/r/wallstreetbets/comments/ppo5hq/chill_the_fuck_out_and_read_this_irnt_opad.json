  "selftext": "Fellow Degens,\n\nChill the fuck out and read.\n\nThe unique situation of $IRNT and $OPAD, is exactly that, extremely unique.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nStock Redemption: Redemptions are **when a company requires shareholders to sell a portion of their shares back to the company**. For a company to redeem shares, it must have stipulated upfront that those shares are redeemable, or callable. ... Shareholders are obligated to sell the stock in a redemption.\n\nShort Interest: Short interest is **the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out**. Short interest, which can be expressed as a number or percentage, is an indicator of market sentiment. Extremely high short interest shows investors are very pessimistic (potentially overly-pessimistic).\n\nGamma Squeeze: The gamma squeeze happens **when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time**. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices.\n\nPublic Float: Also known as public equity float. **The portion of a company's outstanding shares that is in the hands of public investors**, as opposed to company officers, directors, or stockholders that hold controlling interests. These are the shares that are available for trading.\n\nWith that out the way, lets dive into why $IRNT and $OPAD is so unique and why this play is so rare.\n\nBoth $IRNT and $OPAD have had a stock redemption. Not a small redemption but a fucking massive redemption. $OPAD for example has around 92% of the public float that’s redeemed.\n\nWhat’s being shown as “Public Float” on a lot of stock analytics websites is not the actual public float of $IRNT and $OPAD.\n\nThe number of shares that have been redeemed has reduced the current public float of $IRNT to 1.3M and $OPAD to 3.4M. A lot of post already explain the $IRNT redemption, but for $OPAD you can view this redditors post who explains it perfectly. The 8-k and definitive proxy agreement are hyperlinked in his post. So, I wont go into details on my post about the public float as it’s already been written here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/pjn5rw/opad\\_the\\_despac\\_madness\\_continues/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/pjn5rw/opad_the_despac_madness_continues/)\n\nNow, with all this information what does this mean?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$IRNT](https://preview.redd.it/cwm8315r3yn71.png?width=2523&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c66c71d744939897af61b916b1a823dca320848)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$OPAD](https://preview.redd.it/wi6jl06t3yn71.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6824257eba4ddd5f5c022661e875a166c12e9f)\n\nAs you can see, 764.21k is shorted for $IRNT. 764.21k /1.3M = 58% SI%.\n\n$OPAD has 3.72M shorted. The actual float after redemption is 3.4M. 3.72M/3.4M = 109% SI%.\n\nJust to clarify with everyone, these short interest percentages are on the low end. The actual float is anticipated to be shorted by a lot more than just these simple calculations, but this is easy math you can calculate on the open lagged data on the inter-web.\n\nNow, let’s look at the Option Chain. Before I jump into that, let me explain something very important, 1 contract = 100 share. If an option contract is in the money, the holder of that contract must exercise their contract, if they do nothing and the contract expires, the broker will exercise that contract on their behalf. So, for every call option written that’s in the money, those contracts will be exercised.\n\nWith that being said, look at the options contract for both of these stocks. Look at the open interest on the call options.\n\nSpecifically, $20, $25, $30, 31, $35, $37, & fucking $40! For $IRNT and $15, $17.50, $20, & fucking $25 for $OPAD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$IRNT](https://preview.redd.it/i6n9p44w3yn71.png?width=1758&format=png&auto=webp&s=e13c934ca372ef9e68339b4b4c7a1b32f619ea60)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$OPAD](https://preview.redd.it/9n0oa1ux3yn71.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=43013db7d88ee6662cfdd363d6929bd09f82b57c)\n\nQuick mafs = MM & SHF are seriously fucked.\n\nStop stressing out, yes, this is a high-risk trade, but an extremely unique, rare, and with solid probability that this will turn into exactly how we all think it’s going to turn out.\n\nThis is in fact a very high risk to high reward trade. As always, trade at your own risk. But for those who really wanted to see the full-blown potential here, I hope this helped.\n\nThis can very well turn out to be far larger then we can imagine. If a perfect setup was to occur the equation would look like this.\n\nSmall Float + High SI% + High OI% + About to expire ITM = Bananas ... well guess what two stocks have this equation completed?\n\nI’ll see you in Valhalla ladies and gents.\n\nMods, for the love of trading, don’t remove my post.\n\nTL;DR – You need to read the whole thing. No short cuts to this one.",
