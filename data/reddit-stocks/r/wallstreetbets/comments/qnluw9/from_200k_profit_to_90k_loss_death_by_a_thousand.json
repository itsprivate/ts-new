I believe it would be theraputic to me to write this out, and I hope some may learn from my mistakes of this year. There was no single yolo gone bad, rather it was the culmination of many mistakes along the way. \n\n\nIt all started with GME. I had an inherited portfolio of around $200,000, all of which was in mutual funds and highly diversified. I got into GME with $40,000 relatively early at $100 per share, at the peak squeeze my $40k turned to 200k, giving me a total of 400k.\n\n\nObviously the squeeze ended when they turned off the buy button, I ended up averaging down with another hundred shares or so, ended up selling it all at around $70, I was left with around $170k as you can see in the screenshot.\n\n\nMy next meme stock was Microvision. I rode that one from $12 all the way up to the high of $28. During the second MVIS peak of June, I had almost made it back up to $300,000, it then dipped below $20 and never came back. I became married to that stock, I averaged down and just continued to diamond hand into oblivion. It crushed my account. I ended up selling at $11. If I were still holding now, my net worth would be below 6 figures.\n\n\nAfter selling MVIS at $11, my average cost had become $15 and I had around a 25% loss. This brought me to around $130k. I bought CLF before the most recent earnings and got a sweet 15% profit from that. Up to $150k. Then I bought TDOC before earnings at $140, but my stop loss triggered at $130 the day after earnings, before it rocketed up to $150 without me. Back to $130k.\n\n\nI became tantalizingly close to riches with DWAC. I watched the legendary SPAC pump go from $10 rapidly to $15 and beyond, I had a 50k buy order set to trigger at $20, but at the last second, I said \"nah this is dumb\", and I cancelled the order. Had I not cancelled it, and held to the peak, I would have over half a million today.\n\n\nMissing DWAC caused me to FOMO hard. Recently, Black Rifle Coffee went public with a SPAC, I assumed it would do the same as DWAC, you know... conservative pumpers and all that. Ended up losing $10k from that. Down to $120k. \n\n\nMost recently I went all in on BGFV, bought at $28 and averaged up to $32, watched myself recover to $150k yesterday before a brutal 30% dump. And earlier this morning I got out, because enough YOLOing is enough for me. That was my breaking point. And viola! Thats how I got down to $110k.\n\n\nFrom now on, its a diversified portfolio of large caps for me, no more big high risk yolos. \n\n\nMy advice:\nDon't get married to a stock, if you're in a clear downtrend, get out. A small loss is better than a big loss.\n\nSet stop losses to lock in your profits, but dont set them too tight during volatile periods such as right after earnings\n\nDon't FOMO into retarded stuff. \n\nDon't average down, average up. \n\nAssume a stock going up will continue to go up, and one going down will continue down, don't try to time tops and bottoms. \n\n\n[Snapshots of my money throughout 2021](https://i.imgflip.com/5t4zp0.jpg)\n\nEdit: Apes, gamblers and degenerates, thank you all for your kind, encouraging and amusing words. I do feel a good deal better after writing this out and letting it out into the world, it felt like a secret shame that was weighing me down and the burden has been lifted. May you all prosper, and none of your stocks go tits up.",
