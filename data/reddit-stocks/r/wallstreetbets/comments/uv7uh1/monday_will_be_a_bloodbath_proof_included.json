You know the glorious 1980s documentary, *Trader*, about Paul Tudor Jones famously calling his shot?  Of course, you do — it's an essential hype-film for our breed.  So, picture the scene at the 15:56 mark where PTJ2 is selling Deutsche Marks on the Asian markets while pounding a King of Beers^(TM) from his battle station in his weekend-getaway Virginia estate  overlooking the Chesapeake Bay (I cannot tell what computer he was using back then, but I still go to war using my trusty 1996 Packard Bell D160 running Windows 95).  I digress...\n\nYes, the bad news I have discovered and proof thereof.  I use these specific interpolations and extrapolations for my black box algorithm.  It is math-heavy, so follow closely.\n\nThe Shit&amp;Piss 500 closed Friday, May 20, 2022 at 3,901.36.\n\n*May 20, 2022* = 5 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 13 = 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n*3,901.36* = 3 + 9 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 6 = 22 = **4**\n\nAdd together the representing scalars for the S&amp;P close and Friday's date:\n\n4 + 4 = **8**\n\nNow, the market opens on May 23, 2022.  Or:\n\n*May 23, 2022* = 5 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 16 = 1 + 6 = **7**\n\nWhat are we left with?  8 and 7, or 87.  What happened in 87?  Black Monday.  What is tomorrow?  Monday.  Look, I wish it wasn't so, but the data doesn't lie.\n\nMay the tears we shed Monday lube the cheeks we clap Tuesday.  Stay strong.",
