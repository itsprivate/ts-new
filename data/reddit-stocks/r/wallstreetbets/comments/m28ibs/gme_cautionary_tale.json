Remove your fucking stop losses how the fuck does this need to be said. Why are you letting a robot 📄 🙌🏻 for you?</p>\n\n<p>2.) Half of y’all are fucking gods who bought the dip, and got a damn STEAL on some guaranteed lottery tickets 💰💰💰</p>\n\n<p>3.) The other half of y’all weren’t actually waiting on a dip (even though you guys spam it for upvotes like fucking degenerate gremlins) and pussied out when it was time our time to put our NUTS on the hedgies chin. 🌰🌰🌰</p>\n\n<p>The actual important shit:</p>\n\n<p>1.) They are running out of ammo, those drops had fuck all volume behind them. That short attack topped any of the previous attacks, even going back to January. They’re running out of short volume and they know it. We are (for real this time) in the endgame.</p>\n\n<p>2.) CNBC and other shill outlets are tightly gagged, we are seeing tangibly less coverage across the board than at this far up in the share price a month ago. Only rarely to be released to revel in any tiny downtick of the share price. This is for a reason. Last time everybody was shitting themselves over GME, it was everywhere. And because of this, MANY retail investors hopped on the train and sucked up a lot of volume in a short period, hence the silence now. This is potentially a good thing because it means no influx of uneducated monkeys who know jack shit.</p>\n\n<p>3.) We need educate new members of this fuck wagon on what is going on. IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: NEWBIES! YOU’LL KNOW WHEN THE SQUEEZE IS HAPPENING! IT WILL FUCKING SKYROCKET *$5000+ MINIMUM. DONT SELL (unless you have to I know everyone has varying circumstances) DONT BUY UNLESS YOURE READY FOR A HIGH VOLATILITY STOCK. SHIT GOES UP DOWN BACK FORWARD, FUCKING BACKFLIPS. Stop asking stupid shit and hold on</p>\n\n<p>TLDR; Remove your stop losses. Weaponize the newly born apes. Everything has led to now. The media has sorta fucked off, paper hands are long gone. The shorts have one bullet in the gun and they’re saving it to shoot themselves in the mouth. Hang on and have fun. Love you apes </p>\n\n<p>I’m not a cat, I’m an ape.\nThis is not financial advice. \n🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit: ok fuck 5k minimum</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: get clickbaited lul. GO SET LIMIT BUYS STOP GIVING AWARDS HAHAHA THANKS BUT FUCK</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
