My visit made me rethink that gamestop really is doing better than I thought.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.</p>\n\n<p>But seriously, I&#39;m here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven&#39;t paid attention to thier membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use thier membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.</p>\n\n<p>When it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What&#39;s the membership do.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.</p>\n\n<p>I felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.</p>\n\n<p>But the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but thier membership program change is working.</p>\n\n<p>I commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: felt like the new membership program was 🔥, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
