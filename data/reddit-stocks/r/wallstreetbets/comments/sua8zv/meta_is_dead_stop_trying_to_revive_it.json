Really? If you do, you’re likely about to collect Social Security, so congrats on being able to buy FDs forever and remain on your diet of vienna sausages and chicken ramen. \n\nFor the rest of us, however, FB is a mark of a previous chapter of our lives, a chapter where we realized “hey, ya know what? Maybe I DON’T need sparkly glitter gifs or the latest My Chemical Romance song on my social media profile. And who the fuck is Tom to think he can just be my friend!? Fuck you, Tom.”\n\nSee, Tom was smart, though. Tom sold his shit at the top, the apex of MySpace. And we saw what happened when it declined. \n\nFacebook is not MySpace, because the owner of MySpace was smart. Zucc is delusional.\n\nLet’s look over all the DD that FB bulls spew and kill them, one-by-one:\n\n#B-b-b-but they do advertising!\n\nYou know who else does advertising? AM radio stations do advertising. Oh, you’re surprised that’s still a thing? Exactly. And even though they *technically* do advertising, you think anyone is still listening to AM radio? You’re right, there are still AM radio users. Here’s the Venn diagram of AM radio listeners and Facebook users:\n\nIt’s a fucking circle. One, big, early-bird supper eating, 35-in-a-50 driving, “how do I YouTube?” fucking circle. \n\nSo that advertising thing is dumb. Your local grocery store free paper sells ads, too. Think they’re deserving of a $589 Billion market cap? Hell, they’re barely deserving up the prominent spot next to the Duraflame logs and lawn mulch. \n\n# B-b-b-but the Metaverse!\n\nOkay, first off, shut up. Secondly, the Metaverse is two things: it’s stupid, and it’s stupid with a high barrier to entry. The people whose lives are the saddest - so sad that they’d rather retreat to a fake-ass Wii-avatar world than, I dunno, eat a salad - are the same people who can’t afford all the infrastructure it would take for them to pretend to be a woman and catfish other 3D-cartoon dorks who are trying to do the same to them.\n\n$ROPE is WAY more affordable than that stupid headset. \n\nAnd what are they going to DO there? They still need to step into their sad meatspace existence to do things like poop or help Mom bring in the groceries. But advertising to them is going to be big business? Advertising WHAT exactly?\n\nThe people who can most afford a ticket to Zuccland are the people who least need - or even want - a ticket.\n\n# B-b-b-but the MetaMates!\n\nI should hit you in the mouth.\n\n# B-b-b-but stonks only go up!\n\nYou know what, I’ll give you this. Because as we all have seen, the stupidity of this particular crowd that give shit-ass companies market caps that are WAAAAAY more than warranted. So yeah, if you want to treat FB as the next lol meme stock, then who am I to stop you? No one, that’s who.\n\nFor the rest of you who aren’t total crayon-eating morons, think about FB and their value proposition:\n\nInstagram? Fukt. TikTok would like a word.\n\nWhatsApp? Fukt. Isn’t monetized outside of the data it provides, and with the changing platform policies as it relates to privacy and monetizing data, WhatsApp is going to be little more than a less-secure Signal. Your dick pics are not as safe as you believe them to be.\n\nFacebook itself? Yup. Fukt. Still around, serving up the same shitty boomer memes, the same pictures of self-important bullshit with comments that are barely spelled correctly, let alone interesting enough to secure more active users.\n\nOh, that reminds me: Facebook users are dumb as fuck. No, really. These boomer tools can’t distinguish your/you’re or there/their/they’re. You think they’re going to be useful for long? Nope, they’re all about to be fucking batteries. And we all know what happens to batteries.\n\nIn closing, we’ve witnessed Meta’s demise, and I feel comfortable calling time-of-death. \n\nNow who wants to be in my Top 8?\n\nEDIT: Positions:\n\nBoomer brokerage: Long VOO\n\nWSB gambling hall: VIXY $15 3/4p.\n\nEDIT 2: Okay, mouth breathers, let me make this perfectly clear: I hold ZERO positions in Meta (FB). None. Zero. Nada. No options, no shares. Nothing. \n\n“wHy dOn’T u sHoRt iT tHeN!?”\n\nBecause have you seen this market? Companies crushing earnings to be flat AH. Companies missing earnings and green AH and PM. No balls? Sure. No balls. I am ballless. Fine. I’m not going anywhere near Meta though for the reasons stated above.",
