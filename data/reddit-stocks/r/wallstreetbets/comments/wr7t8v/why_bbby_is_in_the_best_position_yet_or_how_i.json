It's me [the guy posting DD about his thick taut nips from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wq7yje/bbby_is_still_undervalued/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) back to tell you all that despite the news of Ryan Cohen today and the 18% dip we took in the final 10 minutes of trading –  I'm feeling more relaxed than ever. I even increased my position on BBBY today to 20k. And i plan on sleeping like a baby.\n\nHow can i be so stress free you might ask? Don't I own 14 contracts all expiring Friday from every price between $15 &amp; $25? Aren't I worried at all that i might go broke and have to go back to working the dick sucking station under the bridge for trading money?\n\nNot a chance and there are 3 reasons i know why this not only isn't the case, but we will be mooning from today until friday:\n\n# Reason #1: Ryan Cohen's News Today Was Actually Good\n\nI know if you're reading this, you've already seen the important posts on this subject, but lets summarize it just in case some of you are Helen Keller level deaf, dumb, and regarded:\n\n* **Ryan Cohen DID NOT sell his shares**. He filed a 144 form (yes it's verified and real) saying he was allowed to within the next 90 days. You'd have to be an idiot to not make the same move given the squeeze potential that is coming up.\n* **Ryan Cohen WONT be selling his shares soon**. According to the Short-Swing Profit rule since Ryan bought his shares less than 6 months ago (he bought them 4 months ago), any profit he made off selling them would be given to BBBY and what self respecting billionaire spends 4 months of his life pumping a company to sell it for no gains? (Besides Jim Cramer if he had $999,998,452.10 more dollars after following his own financial advice)\n\nSo don't worry - the market is not about to be flooded with 10% of the company's stock. I'd like you also to consider the following though - that he would have to be a fucking idiot to sell now:\n\n* **Why the fuck would he sell now when he just announced earlier this week that he's long?** The man already swung prices way higher in march when he announced he owned 10% and prices jumped above $30. Selling now when there are a literal army of apes trying to pump his company's stock when it's still lower than his initial pump with the company would be idiotic.\n* **If Cohen tried to rug-pull the apes over BBBY, what do you think that would do to his other ape centric companies?** The man is Chairman of GME, the original ape stock. I don't pretend he has any love for any of us (he's a billionaire after all - the only thing he gives a fuck about is his net worth) but think about what betraying the apes would do to his bottom line? Who do you think owns GME stock? Do you think they'd keep holding their shares in a company after the Chairman made crystal clear they're trying to rob all apes blind? Possibly, we are pretty fucking stupid after all. BUT the real questions is this: do you think he would risk a significant dent to his $12b GME's market cap just for the sake of netting what CNBC reported would be a $60 million gain (which again HE CANT EVEN TAKE)?\n\nSo no, he did not sell his shares, wont be selling his shares, and it would be absolutely against his interest to sell his shares anytime soon -again i'm not a Ryan Cohen stan, but **look at these facts about what he's doing and use them as your own personal guide.**\n\n# Reason #2: BBBY Said Themselves They Aren't Finished\n\nYou heard it right folks [Bed Bath and Beyond announced they've been working hand in hand with RC to obtain funding](https://www.webull.com/news/52523835). They've been at it for weeks (i.e. the same time RC announced he still owned his OTM calls) and if they're saying this now it can only mean one thing:\n\n**Bed Bath And Beyond are going to announce soon that they've been secured additional funding.**\n\nSure call it speculation but just think about the timing of all this and the comments RC has been making while he's been working to help get them funding. Every nay sayer out there shitting on BBBY over the fact they are majorly in debt will have that excuse taken away. The dramatic stock price increase and retail enthusiasm may be the leading cause for them securing this funding too (so stay fucking hyped). Once the risk of the company going under is removed - what's left to keep the stock from taking off to at least last year's prices?\n\n# Reason #3: The Inverse Cramer Principle\n\nI'm not going to lie folks, when the dip dapped today down to $18 i was pretty worried. I still thought the Ryan Cohen stuff was real news, and i hadn't heard about BBBY's press release, but then i was visited by the Angel of Good News Future:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ci01xqottdi91.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a14572e1b2f99f1e2fc12cae25e7e5b1e4d4ff01\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/guw85xottdi91.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc2cf76da5adf37a043964bd7830032236f2a335\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi51nuottdi91.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5402ac0bd83659498df8c8bd45cf979dcb431826\n\nThe man has been going off the wall spreading fake news and picking fights with us. US. The fucking apes that took a trash video game company from $2 to $480 all because we hated the hedge funds so much. And he gave us something to focus our hate on, so now it's time we inverse him so hard his dick falls off and he finally turns into his wife (who already kinda looks like him just with a wig on).\n\nI honestly thought i was pretty tapped on how much more money i was going to put into this. I wanted to just ride the wave a bit longer, then retire to a bungalow in the Aruba with a jar of lube and a couple of watermelons but no longer. **I'm taking him down.** I'm taking out loans. I'm exercising my call options. I'm putting up signs around town recruiting new apes.\n\nI thought this movement needed a Deep Fucking Value to make it go but i realize now i don't care - **All I need is someone I hate enough to keep investing money and I WILL NOT be defeated by this man who has guided a generation of investors into poverty.**\n\n# TL;DR\n\nBBBY is fine, RC hasn't sold, it seems like BBBY is going to have some extremely big news to come, and Cramer has given us something to rally around.\n\nI'm going in harder again first thing in the morning with another 10k. I'm exercising my call options to really start squeezing them. You all should consider the same.\n\nI'm lowering my target - **IF IT HITS 50 BY THE END OF THE WEEK I WILL BE PIERCING MY NIPPLES FOR THIS SUBS PLEASURES**\n\nEdit - accidentally called RC CEO of GME when he's in fact the chairman\n\n\\*\\* This is not financial advice \\*\\*",

I still thought the Ryan Cohen stuff was real news, and i hadn&amp;#39;t heard about BBBY&amp;#39;s press release, but then i was visited by the Angel of Good News Future:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ci01xqottdi91.png?width=1188&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a14572e1b2f99f1e2fc12cae25e7e5b1e4d4ff01\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ci01xqottdi91.png?width=1188&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a14572e1b2f99f1e2fc12cae25e7e5b1e4d4ff01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/guw85xottdi91.png?width=1180&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cc2cf76da5adf37a043964bd7830032236f2a335\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/guw85xottdi91.png?width=1180&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cc2cf76da5adf37a043964bd7830032236f2a335&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zi51nuottdi91.png?width=1188&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5402ac0bd83659498df8c8bd45cf979dcb431826\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zi51nuottdi91.png?width=1188&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5402ac0bd83659498df8c8bd45cf979dcb431826&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man has been going off the wall spreading fake news and picking fights with us. US. The fucking apes that took a trash video game company from $2 to $480 all because we hated the hedge funds so much. And he gave us something to focus our hate on, so now it&amp;#39;s time we inverse him so hard his dick falls off and he finally turns into his wife (who already kinda looks like him just with a wig on).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly thought i was pretty tapped on how much more money i was going to put into this. I wanted to just ride the wave a bit longer, then retire to a bungalow in the Aruba with a jar of lube and a couple of watermelons but no longer. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m taking him down.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m taking out loans. I&amp;#39;m exercising my call options. I&amp;#39;m putting up signs around town recruiting new apes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought this movement needed a Deep Fucking Value to make it go but i realize now i don&amp;#39;t care - &lt;strong&gt;All I need is someone I hate enough to keep investing money and I WILL NOT be defeated by this man who has guided a generation of investors into poverty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BBBY is fine, RC hasn&amp;#39;t sold, it seems like BBBY is going to have some extremely big news to come, and Cramer has given us something to rally around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going in harder again first thing in the morning with another 10k. I&amp;#39;m exercising my call options to really start squeezing them. You all should consider the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lowering my target - &lt;strong&gt;IF IT HITS 50 BY THE END OF THE WEEK I WILL BE PIERCING MY NIPPLES FOR THIS SUBS PLEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit - accidentally called RC CEO of GME when he&amp;#39;s in fact the chairman&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;** This is not financial advice **&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
