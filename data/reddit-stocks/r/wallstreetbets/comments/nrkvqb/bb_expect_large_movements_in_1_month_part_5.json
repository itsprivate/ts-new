Two major things I&#39;d like to put out that I made in my post last evening:<br/>\n&quot; Tomorrow should if everything is reoccurring and following the trend, be a 30%+ day and probably the highest volume we&#39;ve ever seen. &quot;<br/>\nWe did just that. We hit $20 USD and the highest volume we&#39;ve ever seen on a daily chart and there&#39;s still 1.5 hours left of trading left in the day. Expect a large momentum swing upwards during power hour.<br/>\nFor all of you that are thinking about pulling out, don&#39;t. We haven&#39;t even lifted off yet, but we certainly are close.<br/>\nThe majority of shares were traded at open, this means a large portion of people are sitting $18-$20 USD and will likely be accumulating more on this dip if they are wise.<br/>\nTomorrow&#39;s expectation stands. The range will anywhere between $24.75 USD to $33 USD but it is impossible to tell at this point in the game.</p>\n\n<p>Other things I would like to point out on the chart is whenever we&#39;ve had large openings we have a strong tendency to trade lower than we opened.<br/>\nThis is of the recent bull (crab) run:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jelbb1nak3371.png?width=2549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3e31a9e8bc046d78f8ca6f24fbb2f0164e1090f\">https://preview.redd.it/jelbb1nak3371.png?width=2549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3e31a9e8bc046d78f8ca6f24fbb2f0164e1090f</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the bull (crab) run from January</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/phbd015bk3371.png?width=2555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffcb1c3ab94b26124fe35e28f17f07748ad5aa18\">https://preview.redd.it/phbd015bk3371.png?width=2555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffcb1c3ab94b26124fe35e28f17f07748ad5aa18</a></p>\n\n<p>So what I&#39;m trying to say here is, don&#39;t be scared of the short term from what you see at open and what happens the rest of the day. The charts will look uncannily similar and so will our movements. BB has not reached its critical mass yet but god damn are these charts looking similar except we are exceeding volume and institutions have put a LOT more money in $BB under the $10 USD price point.</p>\n\n<p>BB&#39;s pincer has only begun to take shape. BB still has a lot of room to grow.</p>\n\n<p>All hail the crab pattern. </p>\n\n<p>Check out my recent post history to see the previous parts of my DD </p>\n\n<p>Take care, and stay healthy everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
