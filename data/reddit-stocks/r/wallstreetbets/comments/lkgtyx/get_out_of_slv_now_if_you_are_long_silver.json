Not only SLV is worthless paper, which is backed by...nothing, but it&#39;s actually used to SUPPRESS SILVER PRICES.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll try to sum it up for retards :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People buy SLV shares, making SLV buy silver and ship it to their vaults (sureeee...)</li>\n<li>Silver prices barely increase even though premiums are extremely high and bullion dealers are struggling to ship orders due to the massive demand.</li>\n<li>What&#39;s likely happening is that SLV didn&#39;t buy shit and is actually keeping your dollars...to guess what ? To buy silver when it&#39;s cheaper.</li>\n<li>But how is that called, when instead of buying something, you sell it and hope to buy it back at a lower price...mhm ? <strong>That&#39;s right, shorting.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>THAT&#39;S FUCKING RIGHT. THEY MAY BE USING YOUR $SLV MONEY TO ACTUALLY SHORT SILVER. THEY&#39;RE ACTING AGAINST YOUR INTEREST.</h1>\n\n<p>What ape do if silver go to moon ? Sell $SLV and then what buy?  🦍 ❓</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Safe bet : buying silver bullion. It&#39;s hard to find and you&#39;ll pay high premiums sadly. But it&#39;s the best way to actually make sure you have silver, because you&#39;re you&#39;re own bank. It&#39;s in your hands. This isn&#39;t a risky play at all.</li>\n<li>$PSLV (Sprott Physical Silver) is transparent on their silver and they show footage of delivery, etc. So it&#39;s actually backed by real silver. It&#39;s a closed end fund, which means they will not create new shares unless they take delivery of additional silver in their vaults.</li>\n<li>Buying miners shares. Now we&#39;re getting monkey YOLO. Junior miners tend to skyrocket when silver prices go up. They&#39;re a big leverage on silver prices. They can easily go 200% or so. 🚀 🚀</li>\n<li>Buying junior miners options. Very high IV, but the ultimate monkey play. Leveraging the fucking lever ! Extremely risky but extremely rewarding. 🚀</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t financial advice of any sort. I&#39;m not qualified to give any. I don&#39;t have tangible proof that SLV is doing that but neither do they have any fucking proof that they&#39;ve been buying silver, especially since the price haven&#39;t skyrocketed like they should. <strong>Silver, unlike gold, is a TIGHT market.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Relevant positions : $SA and around 37 lbs of silver coins + 3 oz of gold in my pirate chest. Planning to buy calls on $SILJ as a small yolo play.  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer : lots of junior miners are penny stocks and therefore not allowed to be posted on WSB.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
