I feel that most of the people investing in GME and AMC are normal down-to-earth people( i mean apes) and would not like to have the showoff kind of status but would like to make some dreams came true and have somehow a comfortable life. You would see them in some Mazdas, Honda&#39;s, Fords, Teslas model 3, etc. But the thing is that they would have the premium version with the best engine and all.</li>\n<li>He is debt-free, he won&#39;t talk about it but you won&#39;t hear him complaining about any student loans, car payments he has to do or anything.</li>\n<li>He does not work at that place you knew he was working before. So what&#39;s he doing? &quot;Wait, you quit your job? But it was a stable one and it&#39;s getting even harder to find jobs right now&quot;. &quot; Yeah, I took up *- insert interesting hobby/dream job/artistic activity/starting a business-*, I kind of felt it was the right direction for me, I m doing well right now, I don&#39;t think I will give it up to soon&quot;.</li>\n<li>He&#39;s in college, maybe, or taking some classes to do a career reconversion. Who knew she/he had an attraction for that domain right?</li>\n<li>He spends way more time with family. It&#39;s like he&#39;s always having time to spend with his girlfriend/kids/parents/friend. But he was working 50 hours a week. How does he have time to go on vacations every other week or so, taking kids to the park and all of that? Is he working from home and got a new position at the firm?</li>\n<li>He&#39;s not so active on social media. He&#39;s doing all sorts of things but does not fiend the need to get approval from others by posting share locations or pictures from where he&#39;s going or what he&#39;s doing. Only once in a while, you get a picture with him in a nice place but that&#39;s it.</li>\n<li>Way healthier. &quot;Hey did you start going to the gym? Yeah, had taken swimming and hiking also, I feel very good since then&quot;.</li>\n<li>Stopped drinking/smoking so much or being in a kind of bad mood most of the time. He does not have to do 3 night shifts per week anymore, right?</li>\n<li>Have a nice feeling all around. These people(apes) would start doing charity more, even the ones with more effort, like planting trees, going to the local homeless shelter(which also got build in the last 6 mounts) to help with cooking food for the people in need, helping with cleaning the garbage thrown away by people who last name is also garbage.</li>\n<li>Last of all, you kind of heard that more than 6 or 9 months ago he had a wild 2 weeks, like traveling half the country, doing some weird things, spending a lot of money, driving some luxury cars, but it&#39;s just some rumors, you don&#39;t know for sure. Also, why does he always wear those Monkey&#39;s Business t-shirts all the time, hmm?</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
