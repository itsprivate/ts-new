Everything I could afford and still pay rent. When I bought them the buy price was 8.5 and sell 0. Yes 0. I thought that was because they were just so far OTM. Today I watched Tesla tank and neither the buy or sell price moved. I looked at some of the other Tesla options available on IG (there&#39;s only a really random assortment available, not a whole chain). I realized they were all 10000+ and calls at 60000 were something like 5x the price of puts at 60000. I&#39;m now convinced that for some stupid reason IG prices option strikes in cents for equities (I have traded VIX options with them before and they&#39;re priced in dollars). So I&#39;m 99% sure I just YOLO&#39;d into $6 puts. I can&#39;t sell them cause they&#39;re worth exactly 0. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been so stupid. Guess I 💎✋with my only hope being Tesla going bankrupt (I think they&#39;re overvalued but never going bankrupt). Wish me luck I guess. Fuck me</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: spent all my savings on Tesla $6p Jan 22 thinking they were $600p Jan 22</p>\n\n<p>Proof: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/ZTDWmVp\">http://imgur.com/gallery/ZTDWmVp</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: I&#39;m currently on the phone to IG and the guy is insisting that they are for $600 and IG don&#39;t have any for $6. I&#39;m trying to explain that it&#39;s impossible for them to be for $600 pls help.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
