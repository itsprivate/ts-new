If you havent woken up yet to these posts, which you will see more and more common, is probably your last chance if its already not too late with how high commodity prices are. BUY CORN, no im not saying the ETF $CORN, no im not saying to buy and sell corn futures, im saying to PHYSICALLY TAKE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF CORN. Corn can stay in dry storage for 40 years. Clear out a few rooms in your house and fill it with corn. If you cant afford a full corn futures contract or if you are a rental wagie who doesnt own his own house and your wife's boyfriend only lets you in the dog house outside then buy as many bags of corn from your local rural king/tractor supply and fill every part of your car to the brim. Corn is the fundamental principal of everything and the majority of our economy derives from corn. You can easily convert it into everything from fuel to run your car, feed chickens to make tendies, plastic to build a house, and countless other things. Corn is near its all time high but its not going down anytime soon. Anyone who follows me and knows back when I started talking about corn it completly outcompeted and beat the market. Best investment you can make. It exponentially grows in value because you can grow more corn with corn. You will be KING in the upcomming collapse. No one else in your neighborhood is autistic enough to think of filling their house with corn, but you will be the wiser one.",
