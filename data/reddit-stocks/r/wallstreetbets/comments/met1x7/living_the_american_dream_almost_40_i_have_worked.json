Sorry <a href=\"/r/AskReddit\">r/AskReddit</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This is a 100% self serving post but I feel like I gotta share and who better to burden than the very people who changed my life. </p>\n\n<p>Here goes nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Several years ago I found myself living the American Dream. I was an almost 40 father of 2, divorced and like many people my age, over educated yet severely underemployed. </p>\n\n<p>Going through the divorce brought something to light that was glaringly obvious. I literally owned NOTHING. I have been working for 3 quarters of my life and I had negative wealth. </p>\n\n<p>Car - owned by wellsfargo\nApartment - owned by faceless giant chinese conglomerate\nCollege Education - owned by my student loan servicer (which became the federal goverment)\nZero savings and 20 gand in CC debt</p>\n\n<p>Several disasters later, Hurricane Harvey then a fire, my disenfranchisement hit it&#39;s peak. Resolute to my seemingly preordained mediocrity I began focusing my energy on mearly serviving and making sure my daughters felt loved and safe. Depression and anxiety abound I slogged through the years stuck in a system that was engineered to keep me EXACTLY where I was. </p>\n\n<p>Enter the events of late 2020. I began flowing and got caught up in all the hype that was the fabled Game Stop short squeeze. Inspired by the superstars (DFV, Pappa Musk and the like) I YOLOed my entire cash reserve of 2000$ on GME at 122 as it was on the way back down to the 40s after the initial peak. I was fully prepared to loose it all. I was convinced this was my last opportunity to throw my meager support behind a cause I have never felt stronger about. I was and still am positive average hardworking people like myselves can show the big boys a little of how painful it has been our here 1 or 2 shares at a time. Show them that we see them privatizing all the profits and socializing all the losses. Ever since they recklessly gambled with our futures and TANKED global markets you would think there would be consequences. You would think there would be new rules or new oversight. If anything they learned that they could get away with it and doubled down on the tactics that proved to be so lucrative. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve watched you beautiful apes meme and dick joke your way into something bigger than all of us. No matter what our leaders tell us we are still strong. We still have power to effect change. We don&#39;t have to sit by and watch as the big boys do what they will with our tendies. We don&#39;t have to be afraid. </p>\n\n<p>Watching what was done with profits has truly been inspiring. As billionaires look out for themselves and consolidate their wealth you look out for eachother and spread what you can. </p>\n\n<p>I have zero sense of what&#39;s to come but my uno deck and magic 8 ball say it is going to be interesting. </p>\n\n<p>I now have 40 shares and I am NEVER selling. What this represents is more important to me than profits. And to top it off I can now say I OWN a piece of a company i believe in and I like the stock. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Thank you Reddit. Thank you <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a>. Thank you Apes. Thank you you smooth brained SOBs. I joined the cause on the way down of the first spike. I&#39;ve bought, I&#39;ve sold, I&#39;ve lost and I&#39;ve gained but most of all I have learned. I&#39;ve learned that I am not alone, things haven&#39;t gone too far yet and there is still time (hope). </p>\n\n<p>Preesh</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
