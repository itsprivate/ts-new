If there are still good people left on Reddit, please advise me how to get out of the negative comment status. I won&#39;t be able to reply in a comment when those mods and bots attack me again and tag this as fake news. </p>\n\n<p>This is not spreading misinformation. Chamath did sell out his entire position at SPCE!</p>\n\n<p>Here are the links to prove it</p>\n\n<p>SEC filings: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000170694621000028/xslF345X03/wf-form4_161491010360014.xml\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000170694621000028/xslF345X03/wf-form4_161491010360014.xml</a></p>\n\n<p>Bloomberg report: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-05/virgin-galactic-chairman-sells-personal-stake-for-213-million\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-05/virgin-galactic-chairman-sells-personal-stake-for-213-million</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is what he said last month when he sold another round before selling all of them </p>\n\n<p>“If I could really just go for it, I wouldn’t sell a share of anything I buy because I believe in it,” he said Feb. 8 in a interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Front Row.” “But every now and then, I run into liquidity constraints, like everybody else.” </p>\n\n<p>He SAID he BELIEVE IN IT! he is a clown and hypocrite.
