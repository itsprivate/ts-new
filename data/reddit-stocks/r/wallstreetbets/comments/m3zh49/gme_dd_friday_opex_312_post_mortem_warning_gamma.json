The March 9 cost of the option is $24. If all option sellers hedged, it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume, at the then current prices.  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share. It is highly likely that the sellers of such options would have allowed themselves to be exposed to this risk. They would have covered, hedged, by purchasing shares – adding to the surge.

With the 3/12 gone, that&#39;s almost 30% of the calls OI, but you still have 3/19 that accounts for another 30% of calls OI. The stimmy should be hitting your bank account in the next few days, there&#39;s still a chance for gamma.</p>\n\n<p>I have no opinion on the short interest, maybe hedgies covered, maybe they printed shares out of thin air, I don&#39;t know. But they have been increasingly shorting via puts this past few weeks, this helps the gamma squeeze a bit though not as much as calls.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3rut9av74qm61.jpg?width=685&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f835a0daa0f4f1236f9b5302458a4b2ae21afc\">https://preview.redd.it/3rut9av74qm61.jpg?width=685&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f835a0daa0f4f1236f9b5302458a4b2ae21afc</a></p>\n\n<p>The graph shows that hedgies think 🦍🦍🦍 attention  span is limited to a few months a best, and they are betting heavily $GME will fall within a few weeks from now.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s some graphs courtesy of <a href=\"/u/HAVE__A_NICE__DAY\">/u/HAVE__A_NICE__DAY</a>, she&#39;s an ex hedgies quant who needs karma to post, if u like her graphs upvote her comments.\\</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4yahdek94qm61.png?width=533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04baf8fe07260d2a5468a9c84bf8f7ac96e1f7c4\">https://preview.redd.it/4yahdek94qm61.png?width=533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04baf8fe07260d2a5468a9c84bf8f7ac96e1f7c4</a></p>\n\n<p><sup>$GME Price probability based on IV</sup> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/gyN0nsA\"><sup>https://imgur.com/a/gyN0nsA</sup></a></p>\n\n<p><sup>$GME IV Put/Call Inversion on long dated options</sup> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/HjvbyJx\"><sup>https://imgur.com/a/HjvbyJx</sup></a></p>\n\n<p>According to her : &quot;blue is the implied vol from puts, red is the implied vol from calls; higher IV means it&#39;s trading at higher premium, so puts are more expensive as you go further out in time. <strong>so in the near term, puts are cheap because hedgies are too chicken to buy puts even thought they think the stock is &lt;50 then in the medium-long term (july and onward) calls vs puts premiums flip because hedgies are buying more long-dated puts&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t comment on the business transformation, I&#39;m not an e-commerce expert, I don&#39;t know what it would take for $GME to compete with steam and etc. What I do know for sure is that, if $GME is bought by X% of float net buy EOD, share price will close up Y% EOD. You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES. If you bought shares, it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20% EOD, with ITM(safer)/ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take ~18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry.</p>\n\n<p>With the 3/12 now  expired, the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower, around ~ 40 MM USD net ITM(safer)/ATM calls needed.(that&#39;s about 40,000 🦍🦍🦍 each with 1k 🍌🍌🍌)</p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI,🦍🦍🦍 together strong, YOLO-ers 🦍🦍🦍 buying 800C not helping.</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2 : From</strong> <a href=\"/u/JunkTheRat\">/u/JunkTheRat</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NEW TRADING RESTRICTIONS On GME:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page\">TD AMERITRADE - RESTRICTIONS ON GME</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Opening orders on short individual options are not allowed with the exception of cash-secured puts or covered calls, which must be placed through a broker.  </p>\n\n<p>If you currently own stock in one of these securities and wish to sell a covered call, you must do so with a broker.

Since the delta of the contract increased 0.12 to 0.49 and the share prices rose from 137 to 260-290 within that time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4</strong> : I&#39;m not saying the short squeeze or a fundamental business transformations/earnings beat won&#39;t happen. What I&#39;m saying is the best chance for another gamma squeeze is 3/19.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
