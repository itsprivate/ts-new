Luckily for me, that day is 1 day later. This number has been a dream in my head so it feels awesome typing this out…thanks for reading\n\nTLDR : Turned 6k into over 500k in 2 years while banging you’re wife on the side\n\nBackground on me: 36/married/1 kid/own home/cars/boat/earn mid 100s/yr\n\n2020 :\n\nI started this Roth account in April of 2020 with 6k with the idea of being risky and turning it into something big. If it didn’t work out, oh well as I still have other accounts. I have a brokerage, 401k, IRA as well that I don’t touch all that much (basically it’s in SPY/QQQ) and has been for a while. I have traded penny/small caps with my brokerage over the years and taken out gains to pay for stuff (home down payment, cars and ect)\n\nMost of my experience in trading up to this point was in my brokerage where I did really well trading penny stocks/small caps during marijuana/internet money boom years\n\nAs you can tell by the chart, I didn’t make the majority of my $ during 2020 but did pretty well on Covid stocks and tried out options trading for the first time. I didn’t yolo my whole port into my plays, but I understood the power of options (huge wins/huge losses)\n\nTop 5 gains/losses of 2020 below\n\n[https://imgur.com/PJHF5TW](https://imgur.com/PJHF5TW)\n\n2021 :\n\nEarly part of 2021, I started to get a little bit riskier and got lucky on some of the meme plays. Almost hit 100k due to RKT options in March. Then I hit a patch where I didn’t really win/lose a whole lot until late in 2021.\n\nFake internet money was going crazy, and I just thought it was unsustainable. I tried to find miners and etf’s that tracked it and I landed on buying puts on MARA and BITO, which was clutch as that mooned me up to 200k\n\nTop 5 gains/losses of 2021 below\n\n[https://imgur.com/ABJOvmj](https://imgur.com/ABJOvmj)\n\n2022 :\n\nHoly volatility…in the beginning of 2022 I just played the trend of going down…shorted BITO again and loaded up on inverse leveraged ETFs…I also switched back and forth between bull/bear gang gang multiple times. Lost some on some stupid plays that I was trying to force/chase that brought me down a bit in April, but refocused on the trends and taking profits…nobody ever lost money taking profits\n\nIn terms of what I have been doing lately? Well, kinda what I’ve tried to do all the time, which is play the trends…whether that is meme stocks, short squeezes, inflation downturns…just trying to feel the market I guess…your wife likes it\n\nTop 5 gains/losses of 2022 below\n\n[https://imgur.com/gWDLncx](https://imgur.com/gWDLncx)\n\nI’ve also put picture of my top/bottom plays from over the years in the tax doc that etrade gives me.
