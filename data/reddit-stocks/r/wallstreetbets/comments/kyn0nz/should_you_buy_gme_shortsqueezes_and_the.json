It means it&#39;s about to do something like this:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/frjx9fil1qb61.gif\">fuckin ridiculous am i right, a more recent example would be tesla (TSLA) if you think this is old boomer shit</a></p>\n\n<p>Now the mechanics of it why short squeezes happen are a little complicated for beginners but here are some threads and other links explaining them IF you want to learn more:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/\">WSB Thread</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRyWZ6CXqM\">Video explanation if you can&#39;t read like many of the autists here</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp\">Boring Boomer website explanation</a></p>\n\n<p>There also a lot of other factors at play here, but go search that on your own, there&#39;s tons of good threads here on WSB</p>\n\n<p>AND if you&#39;re really serious about it, ACTUALLY RESEARCH GAMESTOP, its annual revenue, market cap, stocks in general, but lmao none of y&#39;all gonna do that so:</p>\n\n<p>So should you buy GME stock asap?</p>\n\n<p>Do you like free money? Fuck yeah buy that shit 💸💸💸</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER here are some VERY IMPORTANT things you should be mindful of in these upcoming weeks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The very tippy top of Short-squeezes last fairly long, in the picture above (Volkswagen) it shot up and stayed there for a whole day (at around $600, it did spike at a crazy $1000 for a couple hours though), SLOWLY coming back down over a few days, then finally dropping. THIS MEANS this isn&#39;t some minute-by-minute play here, you have some time, just make sure you are prepared.</li>\n<li>In these coming days (or maybe weeks) GME price will waver up and down as the big corporations (Melvin 👿) start trying to cover their asses until eventually it will start spiking like crazy, the Short-squeeze will have started</li>\n<li>Some shit might go down this TUESDAY, it might not, but some shit will <strong><em>definitely</em></strong> go down within the next week or so as corporations are losing big amounts of money as time goes by</li>\n<li>THE LONGER PEOPLE HOLD 💎🙌 ONTO THEIR STOCKS, THE HIGHER CORPS LIKE MELVIN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM, this brings me to my next and final point</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>The importance of holding 💎🙌</h1>\n\n<p>The price of GME will most likely STAIRCASE upwards (going UP then down then UP, etc), as corps begin to short, people with 📝👐 (pussies) will begin to sell because of the &quot;profit&quot; they&#39;re making</p>\n\n<p>Not only will you regret it when the squeeze hits its peak, but you are letting the shorters get off easy by giving them cheap stocks</p>\n\n<p>Imagine this:</p>\n\n<p>you bought GME at $35, it goes up to $100, you panic sell cuz holy shit thats profit, you check again in an hour and see that GME is now $200 because of the many godlike 💎🙌 we have in this sub, then you start crying because not only did you hurt the cause, you missed out on a shit ton more money</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>This is the importance of holding 💎</em></strong>🙌</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Also if you read the DD (basically theory on future prospects) on Gamestop, you&#39;ll realize that it actually does have a pretty bright future, so while this may be a pump and dump for many, <strong>I&#39;m sure this stock will actually reach quite a large number in the not so distant future</strong> (just google Ryan Cohen)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My current estimation for the price target is:</li>\n<li>It will <strong><em>definitely</em></strong> hit $100 within the next week</li>\n<li>It will probably spike to around $200-$300 for a day or two</li>\n<li>It has a small chance of going fucking nuclear and going past $300   🚀   🚀   🚀  (small chance but definitely possible)</li>\n<li><strong><em>It of course, also has a chance of doing absolutely fucking nothing</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, I didn&#39;t want to speak boomer but this is important as this subreddit is quite literally an addiction for a lot of people, DON&#39;T PUT MONEY IN THIS STOCK IF YOU&#39;RE NOT COMFORTABLE, WE&#39;RE LITERALLY A BUNCH OF RETARDS (sometimes smart retards)</p>\n\n<p>THIS IS NOT FINANACIAL ADVICE AND IF YOU LISTEN TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE ON THIS SUBREDDIT YOU ARE ALSO RETARDED LIKE ALL OF US</p>\n\n<p>This squeeze is most likely NOT (fully) caused by us, (assuming we&#39;re around 10% of the shares) but I mean, 10% is quite a big number so we do have a little control.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR:</h1>\n\n<h1>THE MORE OF US THAT HOLD 💎🙌 THE HIGHER GME WILL🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀</h1>\n\n<h1>IT MIGHT BE A ROUGH FEW DAYS OR WEEKS BUT DO NOT WAVER, HOLD💎🙌 AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED, SELL📝👐 AND YOU&#39;LL FOREVER GET LAUGHED AT BY EVERYONE HERE LMAO</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>thank you for coming to my ted talk, and yes i do have many shares</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>edit:</strong> Adding a few notes here since I&#39;ve already gotten so many questions lmao:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do NOT buy stocks with leverage/margin, as corporations can basically borrow those, aka those stocks aren&#39;t yours (as I understand it) Also stocks are better for the squeeze than options, so please try to buy stocks</li>\n<li>What to do if it GME plummets? You can do whatever you want to do, however I&#39;ll tell you my personal plan: I have quite a bit of money in this but I would have NEVER put it in if I didn&#39;t believe in the long term, so if this squeeze ends up being more of a pinch (very small chance), I&#39;m not selling shit 💎🙌 Again, refer to the DD and Ryan Cohens personal letter, this shit has the potential to grow 3-5x within a few or even this year</li>\n<li>If you ever think about wavering and think &quot;ooh man i&#39;m really playing with big money i should sell 📝👐&quot; think about all the other people in here backing this shit up. We have hundreds of daily YOLO threads of people dumping money in this, hell <a href=\"/u/deepfuckingvalue\">/u/deepfuckingvalue</a> our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxeq23/gme_yolo_update_jan_14_2021/\">god</a> LITERALLY has like 8 million dollars riding on this shit, so learn from him and 💎🙌 my brothers</li>\n<li>Again... if you&#39;re concerned or uncomfortable, do your own research, and come to your own conclusions. Don&#39;t take advice from retards if you don&#39;t want too</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2: DD BOOGALOO:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the sheer amount of autism wasn&#39;t enough to sell you on GME, here are some pretty boomer, but very important links that go into detail:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results\"><strong>Gamestop&#39;s very own 2020 Holiday Sale Report</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Important thing to take away here:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<strong>E-Commerce sales</strong>, which are included in comparable store sales, rose <strong>309%</strong> and represented approximately <strong>34% of total company sales</strong>, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over <strong>$1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective</strong>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This is obviously important as Cohen is most definitely pushing for bigger online presence with GME in the future, and uh yeah just the fact that it&#39;s up by <em>that much</em> is uh... 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME\"><strong>Short Interest around 70million?</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>A lot of figures have been going around on WSB on how many Shorts are left, not personally sure how many tbh but <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest\">we&#39;ll know by wednesday</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings\"><strong>List of Institutions holding GME</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Take a look at it for yourself, getting into mega boomer territory here so just know this basically means 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Long_GME\"><strong>And finally, a random twitter user who has been reporting some interesting things</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Honestly, some of the things this guy is reporting is kind of too big brain for me to understand, and you could just write it off as a shill account but so far this guy has been supplying some very cool info on the down low</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: 💎🙌 </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
