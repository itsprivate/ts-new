Hell, this Banana Stand really shows a lot of promise! And Sneed, well, Sneed is like a genius! He had a great Banana Stand over on the other side of town that sold tons of bananas.

He believes that what&#39;s really important is not the money coming into the Banana Stand, but rather how other people like Chuck <em>feel</em> about the Banana Stand. See chuck is a growth investor - not a value investor.</p>\n\n<p>Chuck feels really good about the future of this Banana Stand. It&#39;s only making $1 a day right now, but man Sneed is going to take this Stand places. Chuck decides to go all in and pay $289,080 for a 50% share in the Banana Stand.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Total Banana Stand market value: $578,160</li>\n<li>Total Banana stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365</li>\n<li>P/E ratio: 1584</li>\n<li>Time to recoup his $289,080 investment: 1584 years</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5vjt2r26zx961.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69814500b8efd7f7a233e8fa7f0c6cd63a60c382\">https://preview.redd.it/5vjt2r26zx961.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69814500b8efd7f7a233e8fa7f0c6cd63a60c382</a></p>\n\n<p>edit: Nice awards fuckin soyboys stop giving your money to Reddit you dumbasses </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
