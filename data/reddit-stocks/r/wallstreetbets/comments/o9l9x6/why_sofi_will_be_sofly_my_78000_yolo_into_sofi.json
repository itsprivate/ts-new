They are a payment processing platform that financial tech companies use to process payments, issue company branded debit cards. A similar company Marqeta $MQ which powers $SQ debit cards is valued at 15 Billion ALONE. Galileo is only one subdivision of the SOFI conglomerate, as of this writing $SOFI is valued 16.83 Billion. Over 90% of all digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 Fintech companies use Galileo, it speaks for itself. https://imgur.com/a/slEyUSe\n\n-\tThe shorts and Goliath - This stock has been shorted with an insane borrow fee of 222.82%. Shortable stocks shows 'Zero Borrow', but still lists 45000 shares available. Fintel shows on 06/24 there are '0' SOFI short shares available. I don't see why this stock is so shorted, but it is a company that went public via Chamath Palihapitiya via IPOE.

Banking, lending, credit cards, trade stocks, provides insurance, everything. This is the one thing I have yet to see any FinTech attempt. Most FinTech's stick to a singular product but SOFI is seeking to service everyone's financial needs in one app. SOFI's revenue will only continue to grow as if a new member joins they'll likely use more than just the initial service they got on board with.\n\n-\tSOFI Invest - I think this is probably the most important platform for them to be working. When Robinhood Robin hooded us back in February, everyone was looking for another platform to go onto. A lot of people went to Fidelity, a lot stayed, and a few went to SOFI, this is SOFI's short fall. They do not have margin yet and no options currently, but Anthony Noto, the CEO of SOFI announced that it's on their road map: https://imgur.com/a/apMyXXD\n\nI believe they're aware of of the importance of adding options and margin and I'm hoping itll be soon as they're 100% getting my business after they do so. SOFI Hong Kong already has margin as well.\n-\tSOFI Stadium, come on, what a chad company flexing a stadium even though they're new to the game.   \n\nAt the end I like this company, they have great potential to become a dominating\n\nDisclaimer: These opinions are of my own, I own $Sofi options, and SOFI Shares.
