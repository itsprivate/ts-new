A strong rejection around $57 would form the handle.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tops and bottoms</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yeah they give us false hopes and show us the mid 50s just to push us back down on low volume duh.</p>\n\n<p>But guys, we&#39;re making higher lows. That&#39;s big.</p>\n\n<p>They were able to push as low as $46 (first tit in the tits pattern), then as low as $48 (2nd tit bottom), then $49 for a brief moment during power hour.</p>\n\n<p>Making higher lows and claiming $49 as the new support would be massive. That&#39;s our short term goal.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because $44-$49 had been a massive resistance zone from July 2014 until November 2015. Then it dropped to oblivion.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>History repeating itself</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It looks like we&#39;re losing, but we&#39;re not.</p>\n\n<p>When GME was in the $10-$13 limbo in early November, the price action was eerily similar: pushed down intraday - even after strong bullish moves at open - because of the low volume.</p>\n\n<p>Hopes crushed every day. But little did we know that we were making higher lows and a double cup and handle. Very similar to what&#39;s happening right now.</p>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<p>Currently holding with high hopes for Q4 ER in late March.
