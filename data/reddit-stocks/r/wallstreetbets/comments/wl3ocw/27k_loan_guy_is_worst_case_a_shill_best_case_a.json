Yet here he claims to have caught the top of the GME sneeze-\n\n\" In early 2021 I managed to turn my car money that my parents gave me ($15,000) into over $360,000 on GME. I was luck to sell around $370 and timed the top almost perfectly.\n\nUnfortunately I managed to lose all my gains and then some, 350k, in the next several months on SPACs and penny stocks.\"\n\nSo he just joined but somehow managed to capitalize on GME before the run up/before it was mainstream 1.5 years earlier? Unlikely\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nIn this post he claims that his average on BBBY is [2631@10.26](mailto:2631@10.26). Yet his money from this loan got \"deposited\" to his account Friday the 5th when the high was $8.30, inclusive of after hours. BBBY opened at 10.93 monday the 8th. Thus having a 10.23 average is somewhat unlikely. The only window he could have bought for a 10.23 average on monday the 8th is specifically between 6.57am to 7:07am in the premarket. A pretty narrow window... but plausible, still, if he was that horny to buy on monday, why didn't he just buy on Friday?\n\nHe also said this at 530pm yesterday-\n\n\"Who else held BBBY today through this dip?\n\nI’m not selling!!! Did my dd, I’m confident in my position\"\n\nAt the time of that post BBBY was trading for 10.29...He would have been green? Despite that post, he claims to have sold at an 8.3% loss which would equate to 9.38/share. Less than a dollar down, a weird place to set a stop loss in a stock you are so confident in.\n\n\\---------------\n\nLastly, if you go through his post history it's pretty spammy but mostly filled with nonsense and a confusing timeline of when he claimed to have just fucked a milf, yet days later is talking about his GF, then threatening his GF cause she didn't want to have sex, then breaking up with his GF.\n\nSo best case, don't feel bad for judging him because he is a shit human. Medium case he is a perpetual liar. Worst case (which I'm leaning towards) he is a shill.\n\nAnyway point is; other people smarter than me should dig into further. Also don't trust everything you read on the internet. If mods want to take down this post that's fine, just wanted to bring it to your attention that it suspicious as fuck.",
