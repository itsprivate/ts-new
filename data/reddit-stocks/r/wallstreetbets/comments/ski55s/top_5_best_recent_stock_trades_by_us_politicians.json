[Here's a link](https://twitter.com/QuiverCongress) to the Twitter account where I post trades as they are disclosed.\n\nIf there's sufficient interest, I will post a list of the top 5 worst moves tomorrow.\n\nTop 5 best moves\n\n1. **Purchase of $QQQ puts with a $285 strike and a March 18th expiry by Senator Tuberville on December 29th.** While these contracts are up less than they were a week or so ago (when they soared over 400%), the timing on buying way out-of-the-money put contracts on tech was excellent nonetheless.\n2. **Purchase of $PXD on December 14th by Rep. Kevin Hern.** A week after his purchase, Pioneer Natural Resources ($PXD) made a $3.1 billion sale. This well-timed move has granted Hern (a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources) almost 30% returns in what has been a red month for the market as a whole.\n3. **Sale of $FB stock on January 14th by Rep. Garamendi.** I don't think I need to say too much about this one, other than that Garamendi dodged the largest one-day value drop in stock market history.\n4. **Sale of $AFRM stock on December 28th by Rep. Gottheimer**. With $AFRM down over 42% since this sale, Gottheimer (a member of the House Committee on Financial Services) managed to avoid the fintech loss that many WSBers could not.\n5. **Purchase of $DVN stock on December 30th by Rep. Kevin Hern.** Another big natural resources win for the national resources committee members, $DVON is up over 22% since Hern's purchase.",
