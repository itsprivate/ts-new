He's a $GOEV bag holder who really believes in it. NGL, He sold me, I'm in short term.\n\n**TL;DR -  DeSpac, HEAVY SHORT INTEREST, LOW FLOAT, Near the All time low, Far away from all time high of  $24.90, BEAT DOWN BY SHORTS, and UPCOMING CATALYSTS. 🚀🚀**\n\nHello degenerates,\n\nI hope that you had fun in the roller coaster ride of the last 2 weeks. If you believed in Papa J.Pow, then you definitely were rewarded for your faith! \n\n**1) Anyway, lets start with a quick intro to $GOEV:**\n\n Canoo(Ticker: $GOEV) is an EV startup which plans on selling commercial and passenger EV vehicles which are in production and are slated to be released next year. They have had a lot of trepidation surrounding their SPAC debut which has lead to shorts bombarding this stock to well below it's fair cost. As far as EVs go, it is one of the healthiest EV companies on the market currently with $563.57 million in cash and ONLY  $13.94 million in long-term debt with a market cap of just $1.56B billion market cap. This gives a potential of massive upside if the company meets all of it's expectations.\n\n**2) Does it meet the conditions for a squeeze?**\n\n**High short interest:** Yes, \\~31.21% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV) Which is **HUUGE Really really UUUGE.**🚀🚀🚀\n\n**Low float:** Yes, total float of 99.24 M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 16.18% shares outstanding are being held by institutions  (38.73% of float) [link](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOEV) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV)\n\n**Decent volume** (also because of the high short interest there's a high short ratio): Yes, Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at **4.4M.** [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)\n\n**Shares available for Shorts:** Only 75,000 shares. [link](https://fintel.io/ss/us/goev) 🚀🚀\n\n**High short ratio:** Yes!\n\n**3) For the long term aspects,** u/NY92 **yesterday wrote a book of** [**DD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pt7jzp/the_rise_of_canoo_goev_why_jpows_printer_bidens/) **about it so I don't need to go into it. Check out his DD.**\n\n**4) Now for the fucking elephant in the room, the reason why it is heavily shorted and how it's the catalyst for a short squeeze!**\n\nIt's under SEC investigation for a fact finding inquiry.  The CEO characterized the probe as a potential  obstacle, “EV SPACs are now facing some near-term headwinds, including the SEC’s interest in determination on how warrants  are treated,” he said. The probe covers Canoo’s merger with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC), plus its “operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy,  customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with the recent departures of certain of the Company’s officers.”  \n\nCanoo says that it plans to provide all requested material and fully cooperate. \n\n**5) My opinions.**\n\nDo I believe in Canoo long term? No.\n\nDo I believe in the squeezability of it? **Yes!** 🚀🚀\n\nDid I start a position in it? **Yes**, I started a bullish position in it, although it's a retarded squeeze play.\n\nSo that I don't BS anyone, What I mentioned in this post were my observations of Canoo and I might be completely wrong**.** In addition, I mentioned the SEC investigation so that everyone has a clear picture of what's actually happening. For that reason, this **company has been shorted AF and the shorts have run out of ammunition.** \n\n**Be warned, If GOEV squeezes, it will become very risky during the squeeze. If you choose to partake, only do so with money you can afford to completely lose or don't partake at all because it's a retarded move.**\n\n^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a position in $GOEV.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here.)",
