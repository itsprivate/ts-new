I highly recommend you watch the whole section since it highly speaks of BB&#39;s culture. (0:53 - 4:18).</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hQQlCWMrQA&amp;t=113s\">Here is starting from the juicy part (1:53 - 4:18)</a></p>\n\n<h1>Facebook Settlement:</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement\">Here is Bloomberg reporting in January 2021 that Facebook and BlackBerry has settled with no further details.</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&amp;t=2088s\">CEO John Chen confirms their licensing negotiation involves the complete sale of the majority of BB&#39;s portfolio (@34:48)</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>Transcript:</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Michael Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity Group -- Analyst</code></p>\n\n<p><code>... Should you complete the sale, just the vast majority of your portfolio and you won&#39;t have any licensing revenue going forward? ...</code></p>\n\n<p><code>John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Well, it&#39;s a major portion of our portfolio.</code></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>2) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&amp;t=2213s\">Deal involves one huge payment followed by a tail revenue and keeping IVY and QNX(36:53 - 38:09)</a></p>\n\n<p><code>Transcript:</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Hi, John. Just a question about how you&#39;re hoping to structure the deal for the patent sale. Should we expect ongoing royalties to come from, maybe you get a portion of the licensing fees that you are -- that the buyer will take or is this more of a one-time deal?</code></p>\n\n<p><code>John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</code></p>\n\n<p><code>There is a majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on. I can&#39;t give you the details of this, but for multiple number of years.</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Okay, now you mentioned in the past that you&#39;ve had offers for the entire portfolio. So what&#39;s different now that&#39;s making you consider selling it.</code></p>\n\n<p><code>John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</code></p>\n\n<p><code>There re two reasons. Number one is, I really think it is a wrong thing to sell the entire portfolio because there is so much of our -- we have an ongoing business in cybersecurity and an ongoing business in BTS which of course includes IVY and QNX. I think selling those portfolio will be extremely unwise for the company and for the shareholders.</code></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>3) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&amp;t=2851s\">Tail revenue is up to SEVEN years (@47:31).</a></p>\n\n<p><code>John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Yeah. Paul, that&#39;s a good question. So this is an unusual year. So let&#39;s talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.</code></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>All of this is huge. It shows that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> BB is in the upper position in negotiation by the fact that Facebook is willing to buy a majority of BB&#39;s patents upright to avoid trial</li>\n<li> BB is in the position to negotiate up to 7 years of licensing revenue after their sale.</li>\n<li> BB has a clear business plan post sale.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>BB MOON 🌕</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
