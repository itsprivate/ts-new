It actually makes my blood boil. What got me motivated to write my first reddit post ever was exactly this.</p>\n\n<p>So, there was a post recommending GME puts that got unusually high numbers of upvotes as well as awards, at an unusually high rate. I’m convinced that this guy is from the short side. It wreaked of PR farm.</p>\n\n<p>The knowledge level displayed within the post proved that the OP has a pretty good grasp on the market. However, they omitted some of VERY important key details, while recommending puts/forecasting bearish movement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>They’re promising tendie heaven while they lead you to a slaughter house.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is good though, the fact the shorts are employing tactics like this means they feel that heat is turned up and they are starting to sweat.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you are ready to die now, don’t follow them. Here are some FACTS - longer but super easy to understand as always.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Yes, margin requirement is shooting up</strong> on multiple brokers and a lot of LONGS as well as SHORTS are going to be margin called. Margin requirement going up is something that naturally happens as big movement/volatility is expected. It’s just like how you pay a higher interest rate/higher down payment when they think you are a ‘risky’ buyer wanting to buy a car/house/giant dildo.</p>\n\n<h1>The Melvin underling OP wrote, “Big institutions who are holding shorts won’t be affected by this” Are you fucking kidding me?</h1>\n\n<p>Shorts are borrowed shares from the shareholders. If you are buying on margin, you have what is called a hypothecation agreement with your broker. The shares you buy on margin are automatically available for the big institutions to borrow to short the stock.</p>\n\n<p>Just Google “your broker” + “hypothecation agreement”. Most brokers have this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, the margin call happen to both longs and shorts, but margin call happening to longs also mean the institutional shorts are forced to cover because the shares they are borrowing is getting liquidated/called away. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Also, on most brokers, margin account is a requirement to short a stock as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does THIS mean?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When margin call happens**(due to the margin requirement going way up)**, the short side gets a double whammy: Short positions of many retail account holders are forced to close, and short positions of big institutions are also forced to close.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, they’ve been touting “Buy only shares, don’t buy calls, duh” and this may be because they want to have an advantage over you. Shares as well as calls have their own merit. Yes IV/premium is high I know but just do the math and don’t get stuck buying just shares.</p>\n\n<p>They are basically telling you “knives only” when they are bringing “knives + guns” who remembers those conniving bastards from playing CS? See my first post for more information on this.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it, why would they say “buy shares only” at the same time Melvin Capital spent over 35 million dollars on buying 51,000 puts? (This expired completely worthless btw good job)</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Uptick rule/SSR kicked in because the stock dropped 10%</strong></p>\n\n<p>Long story short, this rule was created so shorts can’t just keep chasing and drilling stocks to the ground. There are a lot of videos explaining YouTube I don’t want to keep this long. Multiple videos also mention higher probability of a squeeze when this happens.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the shorts hands are tied, and they can only kick. The long side is free to swim however. Now tell me, who can swim to the tendie island faster? The yachts are anchored there and they are yours for the taking.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, Cohen is a smart dude who built a $3.5B business from scratch which is now 44.61B as of today.</p>\n\n<p>You guys hate on some of the board members selling on Friday but they may have done this on purpose to wave the 10% flag for the whole world to see. The 10% rule triggering uptick rule actually applies intraday as well but not all are aware of this and while awareness of GME is good now, not everyone has their eye on the intraday chart.</p>\n\n<p>Have faith. BofA and Melvin are big boys but now with the 10% flag raised high and proud, the whole world of smart money is getting ROCK HARD.</p>\n\n<p>🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 <strong>🐻 🌈</strong> are <strong>FUK</strong>🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, one more thing. The Melvin underling also wrote &quot;There&#39;s contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down&quot; <strong>this was a dead give away.</strong> The data was out on the 15th. It went way up. Shorts doubled down but they are close to tapping out.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like when you go to a casino you bet 1, you lose, so you bet 2, you lose, you bet 3, you lose you bet 6.... etc etc to recoup losses. You feel me? Right now they are at hundreds of millions. They might not have enough money to play the next round hence the desperate shilling moves on WSB. Don&#39;t fall for it.</p>\n\n<p>Remember. No matter how big the big boys are, this is going to be a big blow for them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions</strong>: Shares and calls. I took profit on the pop and with that I&#39;m gonna be loading up more on shares and calls at about 7:3 ratio.🚀</p>\n\n<p><strong>p.s</strong> I haven&#39;t forgotten, you guys seemed to have liked the &#39;distribution points&#39; and &#39;used consumer electronics&#39; angles of my previous DDs but there&#39;s more. WAY MORE. I will put the Stadia/digital console argument to rest next.</p>\n\n<p><strong>p.p.s</strong> I&#39;m not saying Tuesday will be the squeeze, just saying, it&#39;s net bullish and you can smell the shorts fear now, so anything can happen.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
