Read it down below to see how!!!](https://preview.redd.it/ts38fvmgl0091.jpg?width=610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a07a2a0bf8c2e72cee353ce2453cfd514a8e678)\n\nDisclaimer : This subreddit is not for picking specific stocks to make lambo profits in a day or weeks by YOLO option trading and margin trading. Instead, we look at the tactical shots that we can apply by understanding macroeconomic events and looking for opportunities where we can grow our wealth during times of market volatility.\n\n\\*\\* Before starting i would like to apologize for the late post. I messed up my schedule because I partied a lot this Sunday. Also, there was a light cut off in my region on Monday and my laptop is a gaming one. No backup ff's. So I will make sure to add bonus content about Monday. \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnough of my BS lets get started…!!!\n\n\\*\\* Edited like 2-3 times because of spacing. I have no clue why it happened. Apologies again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Good morning**\n\n**Respected Traders and Investors,**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoly shit, you're not doing well at all and are hanging by a thread at the mercy of Federal Reserve, or should i say, Joe F Biden.  XD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told you , I told you so. Victory day will be the end of “Buy at the sound of cannons and sell at the noise of trumpets rally” Meaning we will be making a lower low to the price which we did on Feb-march period of time. I also told you Institutions and HFs will be analyzing the CPI data and then decide if the market goes up or down. And that’s the gist of what happened this week, my friends. \n\nAnd you guys must be wondering, why is this guy right every single time. How does he do that. What metrics does he look at. Well, my friends let me clarify this beforehand. I am not an expert at literally anything. Every individual across this reddit group is a more intellectual person than I am and is probably making tons of money. I’m just a normal chess player who fell in love with every asset class across the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Others : White, Stock Market : Black](https://preview.redd.it/h4put00nztz81.jpg?width=5184&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b09d0f8fcf0cd73e7b9d80cf5a45969a8d22565)\n\nI look at the stock market as a player in black pieces and hedge funds, institutions, and me myself as playing with white. Sometimes the stock market plays so well that we think of it as someone using stock fish engines (hence many people simply DCA index), and sometimes he plays horribly like a 100 ELO rating player. And so we all have our own theories and different perspectives on how to beat the stock market. But there is only one game that wins quickly and precisely without a single mistake or inaccuracy, thereby giving max returns and hence beating the stock market, but that game is played by the composite man using the alpha-zero engine. So the people's job in this field is to think about how the composite man might be playing with his pieces and then play their own game. They can either choose to play offensive or sometimes play defense. Hence, sometimes they beat the stock market and sometimes they don’t. The movement of pieces of stock market (in black) can be analyzed by looking at technical chart.\n\nSo\n\nA) either come up with your own ideas to beat the beat the stock market by DCA index, day/swing trading, investing money in multiple value and growth stocks (lump sum/DCA)\n\nor just simply B) observe the pieces and what game is being played by other players on this field. Now this player could be your favorite YouTuber, Nancy Pelosi, some reddit guy YOLOing or any other hedge fund.\n\nIn this subreddit group, my friends, we come up with our own theories and ideas on where the USA stock market is going. By figuring out the direction where black pieces are moving beforehand, we look at the range, where it is headed and hence invest or trade money then. We also identify the risk on/off mood of the market where it could pump or dump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hence FYI : This is not financial advice. It’s just my own unique style of play.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo currently my play, as you all know, is pretty simple : Build cash and DCA at key levels for the next cycle. ( when Dow Jones hits 50wMMA (min) - 200wMMA (max) or SPX hits 200wMA (min) ) But today, my friends, I'm gonna give you a short term idea for 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long intro guys. I just had to let it out. Lets now decide what’s next. No need to rewind the massacre this week. We have it all covered in previous posts. For those of you who are new, i suggest reading these posts step by step. If not move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDante Cash Deployment Indicator\n\nCredit Risk America\n\nApril May June prediction\n\nThe Five Questions?\n\nPack your bags\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now moving on. Lets analyze the problem in the market.**\n\n[Lets identify the problem.](https://preview.redd.it/6eiqjpx61uz81.jpg?width=1164&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b5cca7d3d29fffab91161a00ee9153c864d960c)\n\nDisease : Bear market.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nBare minimum : Recession ( compare it with Oct 2008, 70s-80s period )\n\nMid : Forgotten Depression  ( 1921 )\n\nMax Spread : Greater Depression  (1839, Oct 1929. Now 2019-2025. Are we in a 90yr recurring cycle? )\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nSymptoms :\n\nDownward trend with some reaction rally to upside which ultimately gets sold off.\n\nWorst performance of year since 1929 great depression.\n\nReacting to Oil prices, high inflation, Jobs/Wages data, FED interest rate talk no jutsu.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nProcedure :\n\nGod knows. All we know is that we have to avoid the max spread of the disease. The FED has to keep raising rates and expect that consumers will stop spending like crazy and bring demand inflation down. If they don't then expect a rug pull in September FOMC.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nMedical Cure :\n\n\\- FED put. (cannot work right now because we need inflation to come down first and not throw gasoline into the fire)\n\n\\- Peace b/w Ukraine and Russia or Putin needs to go.\n\n\\- China Economy opens (Cannot recommend this before peace talks because it will cause Oil shock)\n\n\\- Volcker Shock ( Should bring inflation down but bring Economic Depression )\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nSo we diagnosed the problem and the medical report says \"We are walking b/w min-mid spread of the disease\" This doesn't look good for investing purposes or HODL in 2022-2024 ( FED tightening will take 2yrs to come into effect ).\n\nSo we've got no choice other than to \"Swing trade\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Experiment : Swing trade 2022**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hypothesis :**\n\n\\- A sea of red looming in Q4 2022. Most probably 3rd week of september (Quadruple witching of the worst month) or Oct 24-27 (History of crashes) due to recession looming somewhere in 2022-23 ( yield curve inversion and first -ve quarter of GDP)\n\n\\- Inflation comes down without Volcker shock.\n\n\\- Expect 75bps and get 50bps in June-July FED meetings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1 :** Look at the Nasdaq/QQQ  monthly chart and analyze it.\n\n[Chart 1 : QQQ, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT \\(O\\)](https://preview.redd.it/yeuzcvz5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efbf898f03e32971022aca9b37f5915cb8ebc708)\n\nChart 1 :\n\n\\- Stoch RSI bottom with numbers matching left and right. Meaning no significant down move possible with room for a slight leg up in the bottom, though ( like 2008 )\n\n\\- RSI has a history of bouncing b/w 40-45.\n\n\\- PVT(O) is already in the max pain accumulation zone. Meaning some big whales will be buying here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart 2 : 2008](https://preview.redd.it/y892ntx5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a03969ffdd178ef2a356a7647c5e173e9cff6c)\n\n[Chart 3 : 2022](https://preview.redd.it/pxr6bwz5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6a736e34b52aa460f419b846503f59e30a33f0)\n\nChart 2 &amp; 3 : Looking at 2008 and comparing with 2022. We have a lot of similarities\n\n\\- Two red candles and similar bar charts pattern.\n\n\\- Ketlner channel has a history of bounces from red zones.\n\n\\- Fib retracement bounce zone of 50% - 61.8%\n\n\\- 50wMMA is lying in the channel of fib and red zone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult: Rally starts after June fomc. Two green strong months are coming. Est : July , August.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2 :** Look at SPX/SPY monthly chart and analyze it.\n\n[Chart 1 : SPY, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT\\(O\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7ajo8g3ymzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c36e599daab4afe868820d875360df2776812f2)\n\nChart 1 :\n\n\\- Stoch RSI bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- RSI at 40-45 zone. Possible chances of bounce.\n\n\\- PVT(O) not full red. Meaning not many whales are accumulating right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart 2 : 2008 + 2022](https://preview.redd.it/ig1c3l3ymzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ce46ae8d2115f973980901d13337406f3b85459)\n\nChart 2 :\n\n\\- The 19-20% drop.\n\n\\- 50wMMA can come, but there is also a probability it won’t. But there is zero probability it goes straight down from here without an exit liquidity rally bounce of 2 months.\n\n\\- Ketlner red channel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult : Rally starts after June or July FOMC and gonna be volatile months. One green month is coming in August. Rally doesn't look strong in comparison to Nasdaq.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3 :** Let's look at bonds\n\n[Chart 1 : \\(1950 - 2022\\) Blue line : Bond yields , Orange line : Dow Jones , Blue line : Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/r3qgnk4lozz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1bd1e5ac4212f5814d07e1182240acaa6502a20)\n\nChart 1 :\n\n\\- Bond breakout is confirmed. Target : 4.5% min. Max (as per history) : 8-10% which sounds ludicrous right now.\n\n\\- There is no reason to believe that yields go up, then stocks go down. It just means that bonds will become more lucrative to investors and stock indices could have their volatile moves up and down. (Taking into account inflation is under control)\n\n\\- If inflation is running hot over 5% then bonds and stocks get hammered together.\n\nAlso, rising interest rates are bad for bonds. But if they are already priced in by looking at terminal rates, then it's all good. A change in terminal rates to fight hot inflation will make bonds and stocks prices fall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart 2 : TLT](https://preview.redd.it/71qu7t4lozz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=972c47c0740347c4d5a09a9b7ac6d714a0811150)\n\nChart 2 :\n\n\\- I have explained this chart millions of times by now. It said to start buying TLT b/w 15 may - 15 june. Well, we are now past 15. But applying bar charts cannot simply predict days.\n\n\\- Let's look at some more technical stuff :\n\na) Fib retracement from 2008 : $118 ( 61.8% ) , $101 ( 78.6% )\n\nb) Fib trend ext currently : $107 ( 1 fib ), $78 ( 1.618 )\n\n\\- We are currently touching 200 MMA and have a weekly death cross of 50 and 200 which seems to have already made the price go down like 2008.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult : Low yield bonds with AAA safety will get bought before an economic uncertainty or financial crisis. Making stocks fall more. Hence, buy bonds in q2 and sell in q4 peak fear. Provided inflation comes down by August.\n\nIf inflation doesn’t come down by September, expect bonds to get destroyed with equities or whatever asset in Q4. Volcker shock will screw everything up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 4 :** Let's look at our cash. Some might say Tesla, but I say Apple because it has proven the test of time.\n\n[AAPL chart : White : 50MMA , Orange : 100MMA , Red : 200MMA. Will follow DJI](https://preview.redd.it/6dzgpq7jqzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4eed1c152cde980b4092981921ab20e86f091372)\n\n4 things have been concerning me here :\n\n\\- Since the financial crisis of 2008 volume has been declining, but prices of the stock have been rising.\n\n\\- Apple is in a rising wedge and has broken a trendline. Technical target is $100 or 50 MMA. i.e., $95.\n\n\\- Apple tests 50wMMA every time stochastic RSI goes in the lower deep water region.\n\n\\- Apple's Q2 outlook wasn’t good. Meaning it could fall here before the crisis comes in Q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : Apple has never made it to 100w MA since the Dotcom bubble collapse, but we all know it was a joke at that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 5 :** VIX &amp; SKEW\n\n[VIX](https://preview.redd.it/vbaanvthrzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3ae0aac537bf645a358707a94a902342a9a2aa6)\n\nThe VIX at 50, is coming this year.\n\nIf the VIX remains elevated for a longer period of time, it would only mean more uncertainty in the market.\n\n[SKEW](https://preview.redd.it/cpref4thrzz81.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7063bf58904aa35fe515eb9ee70101f54b62a902)\n\nPuts are coming off the market, but prices are at decent lows.\n\nMeaning first an exit liquidity rally, then if people start buying more puts, you can only imagine the carnage to come later in Q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 6 :** Housing Collapse\n\n[Purple line : Housing Index, Orange : 30yr bond yields, Sky blue line : Interest rates.](https://preview.redd.it/tow6oo05szz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f78228fc8fbf4a593e3caf0318df515183261b3d)\n\nMany people were asking why am I saying that the “Housing Market” will collapse in Q4. What I wanted to say was housing prices will start coming down in Q4 due to inventory build-up ( lumber prices are coming down ) , plus interest rates skyrocketing to 2% by the end of the year. The prices have rose enough and now the only way is down.\n\nThe absolute bottom of prices will be visible in 2024. But for a crash in Q4, we need a volcker shock on housing in 2022 itself. If it happens it will break the housing market. Powell promised us he wouldn't do that until August-September CPI data. So watch out for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 7 :** So we talked about money and housing. Well then let's talk about a sensitive topic called wheat. I’m not here to explain where wheat is used. You guys are smart and can figure it out yourself by observing day-to day life.\n\n[Wheat Futures \\/ Average US median income](https://preview.redd.it/pwsznbtpszz81.png?width=1547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1d702dc3a8e09313f98f5f1208d925a138e6270)\n\nWhat I can do is plot a graph of wheat futures and divide it by our median household income. What I found was that wheat prices have been on a dramatic rise. Now what does it mean when prices go up? It means either the demand is quite high or the supply has decreased. In this case, we all know it's the latter (Ukraine + India + Russia factors).\n\nSo what does it mean ? It means food shortages are real. If America doesn't start producing enough and people keep thinking that they can flip NFTs or trade options, then we are in trouble. We cannot just assume that the other person is gonna produce things. Who knows, maybe the other person is under the same impression. This topic is subject to dispute and everyone can come up with their own case. But I thought, just let's bring this up to raise awareness among people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\n1. Buying an index is a lot safer than picking stocks at the moment because you never know. (Just told you with apple stock. 50wMMA  becould come before Q4)\n2. In Index analysis (i.e. SPY , QQQ) expect 1/2 months of green (July, August) and more profitable to buy Nasdaq because its all beaten up, bad plus historical analysis.\n3. I do not know the exact bottom in May, June. Could be much lower from here. But what I know is a rally is about to start post-FOMC in June for NASDAQ and SPX post July FOMC. I have no idea why that is an inconsistency. I’m just telling you what my charts tell me.\n4. FED If - else statement\n\nIf\n\nThe FED controls inflation, then bonds buy date will be May-June period and pain for equities in Q4 where the low yield bond prices will be high as investors will turn on the safety notch to gear  (Second derivative rise in the prices of bonds could crash equity)\n\n(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2024)\n\nElse\n\nThe FED has no control over inflation and Volcker shocks us. Then bonds and equities get hammered together with other financial assets come Q4.\n\n(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2022-23)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result :** \n\nEither way. A crisis is looming for the equities market in September - October 2022, period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Invalidation :**\n\nEvery theory and experiment has an invalidation case.\n\nMy theory has just 1.\n\nIf FED breaks something in a tightening cycle which hasn't even begun yet (starts June) then we could see indices and stocks plummet more like in 2018 after FED decided to shrink its balance sheet. On average it was a 7-8% drop.\n\nQE : FED buys treasuries in the open market.\n\nQT : FED sells treasuries in the open market. (Selling is of two types. Let treasuries mature or not)\n\nHence, June is so important. We will see then, if these balance sheets selling by the FED are priced in or not by the bond market. If the answer is no, then no fake exit liquidity rally in July-August. Bond prices will fall with equities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For this week ahead.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bloomberg Week](https://preview.redd.it/c9o3ble9yzz81.png?width=1771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c97a919668de5a84ca0b5fa610c7566c090beb3)\n\nMonday (Bonus) Content :\n\n\\- We had construction worker data which is a leading indicator to recession and it has never been wrong which says recession in 2023 is 10000% guaranteed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Manufacturing data from China was so bad on Monday, but don't let this fool you. I have told you in my previous posts investing in China/Hong Kong is better than investing in America going forward 10-30 years. Just look at charts of China CSI 300, Hang Seng and Nasdaq. This doesn't mean throwing all your money in. It just means having a % allocated to international funds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Powell came in and said :\n\nPaul Volckering right now might be the right idea and could bring inflation down. But we dont know that yet and need more numbers (right now inflation is anchored and coming down in 5yr breakevens, but if it goes up sell everything and short or stay in cash)\n\nPowell Earlier : To fight inflation, we will avoid recession and high employment.\n\nPowell Now    : To fight inflation, we will avoid recession or high employment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- All-in Podcast is the greatest podcast ever created in the history of financial economics.

Read it down below to see how!!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer : This subreddit is not for picking specific stocks to make lambo profits in a day or weeks by YOLO option trading and margin trading. Instead, we look at the tactical shots that we can apply by understanding macroeconomic events and looking for opportunities where we can grow our wealth during times of market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;** Before starting i would like to apologize for the late post. I messed up my schedule because I partied a lot this Sunday. Also, there was a light cut off in my region on Monday and my laptop is a gaming one. No backup ff&amp;#39;s. So I will make sure to add bonus content about Monday. **&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enough of my BS lets get started…!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;** Edited like 2-3 times because of spacing. I have no clue why it happened. Apologies again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good morning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respected Traders and Investors,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, you&amp;#39;re not doing well at all and are hanging by a thread at the mercy of Federal Reserve, or should i say, Joe F Biden.  XD&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told you , I told you so. Victory day will be the end of “Buy at the sound of cannons and sell at the noise of trumpets rally” Meaning we will be making a lower low to the price which we did on Feb-march period of time. I also told you Institutions and HFs will be analyzing the CPI data and then decide if the market goes up or down. And that’s the gist of what happened this week, my friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you guys must be wondering, why is this guy right every single time. How does he do that. What metrics does he look at. Well, my friends let me clarify this beforehand. I am not an expert at literally anything. Every individual across this reddit group is a more intellectual person than I am and is probably making tons of money. I’m just a normal chess player who fell in love with every asset class across the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h4put00nztz81.jpg?width=5184&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b09d0f8fcf0cd73e7b9d80cf5a45969a8d22565\"&gt;Others : White, Stock Market : Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look at the stock market as a player in black pieces and hedge funds, institutions, and me myself as playing with white. Sometimes the stock market plays so well that we think of it as someone using stock fish engines (hence many people simply DCA index), and sometimes he plays horribly like a 100 ELO rating player. And so we all have our own theories and different perspectives on how to beat the stock market. But there is only one game that wins quickly and precisely without a single mistake or inaccuracy, thereby giving max returns and hence beating the stock market, but that game is played by the composite man using the alpha-zero engine. So the people&amp;#39;s job in this field is to think about how the composite man might be playing with his pieces and then play their own game. They can either choose to play offensive or sometimes play defense. Hence, sometimes they beat the stock market and sometimes they don’t. The movement of pieces of stock market (in black) can be analyzed by looking at technical chart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) either come up with your own ideas to beat the beat the stock market by DCA index, day/swing trading, investing money in multiple value and growth stocks (lump sum/DCA)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or just simply B) observe the pieces and what game is being played by other players on this field. Now this player could be your favorite YouTuber, Nancy Pelosi, some reddit guy YOLOing or any other hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this subreddit group, my friends, we come up with our own theories and ideas on where the USA stock market is going. By figuring out the direction where black pieces are moving beforehand, we look at the range, where it is headed and hence invest or trade money then. We also identify the risk on/off mood of the market where it could pump or dump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hence FYI : This is not financial advice. It’s just my own unique style of play.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So currently my play, as you all know, is pretty simple : Build cash and DCA at key levels for the next cycle. ( when Dow Jones hits 50wMMA (min) - 200wMMA (max) or SPX hits 200wMA (min) ) But today, my friends, I&amp;#39;m gonna give you a short term idea for 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long intro guys. I just had to let it out. Lets now decide what’s next. No need to rewind the massacre this week. We have it all covered in previous posts. For those of you who are new, i suggest reading these posts step by step. If not move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dante Cash Deployment Indicator&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Credit Risk America&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;April May June prediction&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Five Questions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pack your bags&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now moving on. Lets analyze the problem in the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6eiqjpx61uz81.jpg?width=1164&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1b5cca7d3d29fffab91161a00ee9153c864d960c\"&gt;Lets identify the problem.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disease : Bear market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bare minimum : Recession ( compare it with Oct 2008, 70s-80s period )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mid : Forgotten Depression  ( 1921 )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max Spread : Greater Depression  (1839, Oct 1929. Now 2019-2025. Are we in a 90yr recurring cycle? )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Symptoms :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Downward trend with some reaction rally to upside which ultimately gets sold off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worst performance of year since 1929 great depression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reacting to Oil prices, high inflation, Jobs/Wages data, FED interest rate talk no jutsu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Procedure :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God knows. All we know is that we have to avoid the max spread of the disease. The FED has to keep raising rates and expect that consumers will stop spending like crazy and bring demand inflation down. If they don&amp;#39;t then expect a rug pull in September FOMC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Medical Cure :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- FED put. (cannot work right now because we need inflation to come down first and not throw gasoline into the fire)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Peace b/w Ukraine and Russia or Putin needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- China Economy opens (Cannot recommend this before peace talks because it will cause Oil shock)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Volcker Shock ( Should bring inflation down but bring Economic Depression )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we diagnosed the problem and the medical report says &amp;quot;We are walking b/w min-mid spread of the disease&amp;quot; This doesn&amp;#39;t look good for investing purposes or HODL in 2022-2024 ( FED tightening will take 2yrs to come into effect ).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ve got no choice other than to &amp;quot;Swing trade&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment : Swing trade 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- A sea of red looming in Q4 2022. Most probably 3rd week of september (Quadruple witching of the worst month) or Oct 24-27 (History of crashes) due to recession looming somewhere in 2022-23 ( yield curve inversion and first -ve quarter of GDP)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Inflation comes down without Volcker shock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Expect 75bps and get 50bps in June-July FED meetings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1 :&lt;/strong&gt; Look at the Nasdaq/QQQ  monthly chart and analyze it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yeuzcvz5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=efbf898f03e32971022aca9b37f5915cb8ebc708\"&gt;Chart 1 : QQQ, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT (O)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chart 1 :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Stoch RSI bottom with numbers matching left and right. Meaning no significant down move possible with room for a slight leg up in the bottom, though ( like 2008 )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- RSI has a history of bouncing b/w 40-45.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- PVT(O) is already in the max pain accumulation zone. Meaning some big whales will be buying here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y892ntx5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=99a03969ffdd178ef2a356a7647c5e173e9cff6c\"&gt;Chart 2 : 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pxr6bwz5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9a6a736e34b52aa460f419b846503f59e30a33f0\"&gt;Chart 3 : 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chart 2 &amp;amp; 3 : Looking at 2008 and comparing with 2022. We have a lot of similarities&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Two red candles and similar bar charts pattern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Ketlner channel has a history of bounces from red zones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Fib retracement bounce zone of 50% - 61.8%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 50wMMA is lying in the channel of fib and red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Result: Rally starts after June fomc. Two green strong months are coming. Est : July , August.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2 :&lt;/strong&gt; Look at SPX/SPY monthly chart and analyze it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7ajo8g3ymzz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c36e599daab4afe868820d875360df2776812f2\"&gt;Chart 1 : SPY, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT(O)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chart 1 :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Stoch RSI bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- RSI at 40-45 zone. Possible chances of bounce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- PVT(O) not full red. Meaning not many whales are accumulating right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ig1c3l3ymzz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6ce46ae8d2115f973980901d13337406f3b85459\"&gt;Chart 2 : 2008 + 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chart 2 :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The 19-20% drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 50wMMA can come, but there is also a probability it won’t. But there is zero probability it goes straight down from here without an exit liquidity rally bounce of 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Ketlner red channel&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Result : Rally starts after June or July FOMC and gonna be volatile months. One green month is coming in August. Rally doesn&amp;#39;t look strong in comparison to Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3 :&lt;/strong&gt; Let&amp;#39;s look at bonds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r3qgnk4lozz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c1bd1e5ac4212f5814d07e1182240acaa6502a20\"&gt;Chart 1 : (1950 - 2022) Blue line : Bond yields , Orange line : Dow Jones , Blue line : Inflation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chart 1 :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Bond breakout is confirmed. Target : 4.5% min. Max (as per history) : 8-10% which sounds ludicrous right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- There is no reason to believe that yields go up, then stocks go down. It just means that bonds will become more lucrative to investors and stock indices could have their volatile moves up and down. (Taking into account inflation is under control)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- If inflation is running hot over 5% then bonds and stocks get hammered together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, rising interest rates are bad for bonds. But if they are already priced in by looking at terminal rates, then it&amp;#39;s all good. A change in terminal rates to fight hot inflation will make bonds and stocks prices fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/71qu7t4lozz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=972c47c0740347c4d5a09a9b7ac6d714a0811150\"&gt;Chart 2 : TLT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chart 2 :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I have explained this chart millions of times by now. It said to start buying TLT b/w 15 may - 15 june. Well, we are now past 15. But applying bar charts cannot simply predict days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Let&amp;#39;s look at some more technical stuff :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a) Fib retracement from 2008 : $118 ( 61.8% ) , $101 ( 78.6% )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b) Fib trend ext currently : $107 ( 1 fib ), $78 ( 1.618 )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- We are currently touching 200 MMA and have a weekly death cross of 50 and 200 which seems to have already made the price go down like 2008.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Result : Low yield bonds with AAA safety will get bought before an economic uncertainty or financial crisis. Making stocks fall more. Hence, buy bonds in q2 and sell in q4 peak fear. Provided inflation comes down by August.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If inflation doesn’t come down by September, expect bonds to get destroyed with equities or whatever asset in Q4. Volcker shock will screw everything up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4 :&lt;/strong&gt; Let&amp;#39;s look at our cash. Some might say Tesla, but I say Apple because it has proven the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6dzgpq7jqzz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4eed1c152cde980b4092981921ab20e86f091372\"&gt;AAPL chart : White : 50MMA , Orange : 100MMA , Red : 200MMA. Will follow DJI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 things have been concerning me here :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Since the financial crisis of 2008 volume has been declining, but prices of the stock have been rising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Apple is in a rising wedge and has broken a trendline. Technical target is $100 or 50 MMA. i.e., $95.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Apple tests 50wMMA every time stochastic RSI goes in the lower deep water region.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Apple&amp;#39;s Q2 outlook wasn’t good. Meaning it could fall here before the crisis comes in Q4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note : Apple has never made it to 100w MA since the Dotcom bubble collapse, but we all know it was a joke at that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5 :&lt;/strong&gt; VIX &amp;amp; SKEW&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vbaanvthrzz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3ae0aac537bf645a358707a94a902342a9a2aa6\"&gt;VIX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VIX at 50, is coming this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the VIX remains elevated for a longer period of time, it would only mean more uncertainty in the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cpref4thrzz81.png?width=1538&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7063bf58904aa35fe515eb9ee70101f54b62a902\"&gt;SKEW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Puts are coming off the market, but prices are at decent lows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning first an exit liquidity rally, then if people start buying more puts, you can only imagine the carnage to come later in Q4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6 :&lt;/strong&gt; Housing Collapse&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tow6oo05szz81.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f78228fc8fbf4a593e3caf0318df515183261b3d\"&gt;Purple line : Housing Index, Orange : 30yr bond yields, Sky blue line : Interest rates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people were asking why am I saying that the “Housing Market” will collapse in Q4. What I wanted to say was housing prices will start coming down in Q4 due to inventory build-up ( lumber prices are coming down ) , plus interest rates skyrocketing to 2% by the end of the year. The prices have rose enough and now the only way is down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The absolute bottom of prices will be visible in 2024. But for a crash in Q4, we need a volcker shock on housing in 2022 itself. If it happens it will break the housing market. Powell promised us he wouldn&amp;#39;t do that until August-September CPI data. So watch out for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7 :&lt;/strong&gt; So we talked about money and housing. Well then let&amp;#39;s talk about a sensitive topic called wheat. I’m not here to explain where wheat is used. You guys are smart and can figure it out yourself by observing day-to day life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pwsznbtpszz81.png?width=1547&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f1d702dc3a8e09313f98f5f1208d925a138e6270\"&gt;Wheat Futures / Average US median income&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I can do is plot a graph of wheat futures and divide it by our median household income. What I found was that wheat prices have been on a dramatic rise. Now what does it mean when prices go up? It means either the demand is quite high or the supply has decreased. In this case, we all know it&amp;#39;s the latter (Ukraine + India + Russia factors).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean ? It means food shortages are real. If America doesn&amp;#39;t start producing enough and people keep thinking that they can flip NFTs or trade options, then we are in trouble. We cannot just assume that the other person is gonna produce things. Who knows, maybe the other person is under the same impression. This topic is subject to dispute and everyone can come up with their own case. But I thought, just let&amp;#39;s bring this up to raise awareness among people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buying an index is a lot safer than picking stocks at the moment because you never know. (Just told you with apple stock. 50wMMA  becould come before Q4)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In Index analysis (i.e. SPY , QQQ) expect 1/2 months of green (July, August) and more profitable to buy Nasdaq because its all beaten up, bad plus historical analysis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I do not know the exact bottom in May, June. Could be much lower from here. But what I know is a rally is about to start post-FOMC in June for NASDAQ and SPX post July FOMC. I have no idea why that is an inconsistency. I’m just telling you what my charts tell me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;FED If - else statement&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FED controls inflation, then bonds buy date will be May-June period and pain for equities in Q4 where the low yield bond prices will be high as investors will turn on the safety notch to gear  (Second derivative rise in the prices of bonds could crash equity)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2024)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Else&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FED has no control over inflation and Volcker shocks us. Then bonds and equities get hammered together with other financial assets come Q4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2022-23)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result :&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way. A crisis is looming for the equities market in September - October 2022, period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invalidation :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every theory and experiment has an invalidation case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory has just 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If FED breaks something in a tightening cycle which hasn&amp;#39;t even begun yet (starts June) then we could see indices and stocks plummet more like in 2018 after FED decided to shrink its balance sheet. On average it was a 7-8% drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;QE : FED buys treasuries in the open market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;QT : FED sells treasuries in the open market. (Selling is of two types. Let treasuries mature or not)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hence, June is so important. We will see then, if these balance sheets selling by the FED are priced in or not by the bond market. If the answer is no, then no fake exit liquidity rally in July-August. Bond prices will fall with equities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For this week ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c9o3ble9yzz81.png?width=1771&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6c97a919668de5a84ca0b5fa610c7566c090beb3\"&gt;Bloomberg Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monday (Bonus) Content :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- We had construction worker data which is a leading indicator to recession and it has never been wrong which says recession in 2023 is 10000% guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Manufacturing data from China was so bad on Monday, but don&amp;#39;t let this fool you. I have told you in my previous posts investing in China/Hong Kong is better than investing in America going forward 10-30 years. Just look at charts of China CSI 300, Hang Seng and Nasdaq. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean throwing all your money in. It just means having a % allocated to international funds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Powell came in and said :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paul Volckering right now might be the right idea and could bring inflation down. But we dont know that yet and need more numbers (right now inflation is anchored and coming down in 5yr breakevens, but if it goes up sell everything and short or stay in cash)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Powell Earlier : To fight inflation, we will avoid recession and high employment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Powell Now    : To fight inflation, we will avoid recession or high employment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- All-in Podcast is the greatest podcast ever created in the history of financial economics. If you&amp;#39;re not watching that, you&amp;#39;re missing out a lot. Elon came into the epi 69 podcast and boi he said a lot of things. Do watch it guys and make sure you don&amp;#39;t skip the cool intro song.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Who is buying my CDS?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hgzcwljszzz81.png?width=403&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3b700375bf204fb7721e6a61971fadbda404769c\"&gt;CDS 5yr USA have broken the resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your homework :&lt;/strong&gt; Work on Gold/Silver &amp;amp; oil charts and see if it fits your theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep enjoying life guys. Go call your friends from school or college. In times ahead we would need people to participate in communities and work, and have fun together. We can&amp;#39;t just remain robots and enjoy life by ourselves. Call your families, too, every weekend because they are important, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the economy is going to the 70&amp;#39;s or 1929, so lets then create a vibe from that era. XDThe 2022-2025 period is gonna be so harsh and challenging that you have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.s. I know my post sucks and I am sorry that I didn&amp;#39;t put more effort into it. I was busy partying on the weekend. ( Probably spending like no tomorrow XD)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uchiha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
