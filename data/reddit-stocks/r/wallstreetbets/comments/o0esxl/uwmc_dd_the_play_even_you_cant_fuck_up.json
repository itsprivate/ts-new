Let me tell you why we are missing a simple, straight forward, trip to tendie town.</p>\n\n<p>UWMC has had a nice run over the last month, up about 25% over that time and up 10% over the last week. This has run the share price to over $10 per share making the potential for us to get a little sweet gamma action with the 6/18 contracts looming.</p>\n\n<p>Open interest on ITM calls is getting interesting. Already over 100k contracts are in the money, mostly between 9c and 10c. You could see the price action today as they try to beat the price down to 10.00 one last time (and the piss poor volume is making it easy for them) before hedging some of these positions. If we were to get over 11.00 by EOW, that&#39;s another 60k open interest on the 11c alone!! and this will force more buying to cover these contracts. You know what happens from here. This is why we are here.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is the lack of volume. Again, 10 million volume today, for fuck sake people. With a float of 90m shares (I don&#39;t want to start a pissing match, but much smaller than CLOV and CLNE), this thing is not hard to move. With 25m volume on 6/9 we had an 8% move. With volume of 13m on 6/11 another 6% jump. After today the share price is sitting just above 10. I am a retard, and not a mathematician, but another 10% by EOW and then we party. Hookers, blow, whatever you want.</p>\n\n<p>Ill cover this just cuz I know you retards get hard over the potential. &gt;15% short float. Not why I am here, but you never know once this things gets moving.</p>\n\n<p>Nextly, the calls because this is a casino after all. 7/16 calls are very reasonable, fuck, I&#39;d call them a god damn bargain for the potential we are looking at here. This thing has yet to lift off and the IV is still reasonable enough to jump on this gamma rocket.</p>\n\n<p>Last point I will make. UWMC is actually a solid company. I am not covering the fundamentals a ton, but holding a $10 UWMC bag is a lot more attractive than others I have seen gain steam recently. 4% dividend, upcoming 300m in share buy back, Revenue and EPS doubled from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. Not even you can fuck this up. You make money now, you make money later, your kids make money in 20 years from your wise decision this week. Get a forward from your wife&#39;s bf on this weeks allowance and get you some of this action.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: 150 shares at 8.20 average, (24) 7/16 calls at various strike.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: UWMC on the launch pad, needs a little more fuel.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
