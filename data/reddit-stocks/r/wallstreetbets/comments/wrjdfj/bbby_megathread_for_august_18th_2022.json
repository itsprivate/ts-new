Each made its way at different times and came with some great memes, some big wins, some mind-boggling losses, and some great memories, and each one brought on many new members to our community and to retail trading.\n\nI want to take this opportunity to reflect back during Jan. 2021 from behind the scenes.  As we were just about to hit another milestone of 2 million subscribers.  GME popped on our radar seemingly out of nowhere and very quickly gain a lot of traction similarly to $BBBY.\n\n/r/wallstreetbets was a bigger story than covid. Every major publication and media outlet in the world rushed to make some sense of what was going on, all requested interviews with us and what I noticed was happening, each was not looking to report the news but every journalist had their own version of a story and was only looking for us to go on record on many things that were just made up and just not true. With the amount of media coverage 7 million new members flooded into /r/wallstreetbets and the ethos of our community became extremely muddied as many outside our community came in to speak for us as the media rushed to get their version of the story out.\n\nI think it is exciting and amazing to see so many new members but let's not forget that a majority of members are new so take what is said with a grain of salt and do your own research.  Not everything is a short squeeze, not everything is a cryptic message.\n\n/r/wallstreetbets first and foremost is about the come up and getting that bag.  The stories about what some people are willing to risk to get the bag and stories about their success or failure are what make this place amazing and fun.  It's your money and your own responsibility for how you choose to use it.  Get in, get out, move on and repeat the process.\n\nTy Have Fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxoo5pkr2hi91.png?width=290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59581fed72a9a7ac80437487c1024a43d9783a9\n\nWe are giving away some new /r/wallstreetbets  deskmats!\n\nWinners will be picked at the end of the day.\n\nPost what you think the price target BBBY will close at today ?  ( Cutoff will be 2 hours before the market close).\n\nPost the best BBBY Meme\n\nPost your gains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nvmle849hi91.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4dd20e459600118dd30f7c55adc63443f703583",
