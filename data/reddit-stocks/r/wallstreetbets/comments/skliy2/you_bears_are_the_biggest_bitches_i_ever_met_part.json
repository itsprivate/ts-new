Did it make you fweel special? Did you think the bear mawket is here becwause an alien CEO didn't beat estimates?\"*\n\nYeah, didn't think so.\n\nLook, you bears need to learn how to read the room. Take a look at this graph right here:\n\n[https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-november-5-2021](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-november-5-2021)\n\nyeah, thats right. 92% of information technology companies beat estimates last quarter. What part of this screams bear market to you? Hmmm? When you look at this chart, what make you think tech stocks are honestly going to 0?\n\nLike how does your logic even work? Is it something like this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\\*MSFT beats earnings and raises guidance  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: doesn't count  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*AAPL crushes earnings and raises guidance  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: I didn't see that  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*AMD crushes expectations and raise guidance  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*GOOG reports stellar earnings and issues 20:1 split  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: FAAAAKE NEWS  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*FB beats revenue but misses EPS by 17 cents with guidance just below lower range for next quarter  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: we ride at dawn, bitches!!\n\nAnyways, like I said before, since you are all clearly a bunch of mentally handicapped dotes, I'm willing to bet 90% of you **FUCKING DOUBLED DOWN** on your short term puts instead of cashing out like you should have done. Now looking at the charts, its clear you are getting sodomized by the delta while vega gang skull fucks you to death with the IV crush all the while theta gang sits in the corner, films the whole thing while touching himself.\n\nHonestly, if you bears are willing give up so much wealth, so quickly, you might as well join those communists on r/antiwork.\n\nI mean, what are you waiting for? You're already poor, starving, radical, the only thing left for you is to try to seize the means of production.\n\nTo wrap this up, I better see some hefty loss porn next week you hoes.\n\nGranny out.\n\n*\\*hops on mobility scooter*\n\nOh wait, I forgot\n\n*\\*spits on your face again*\n\n*\\*hops back on scooter and zooms back to retirement home.*\n\n**Edit 1:** The fact that I'm getting awards but only sitting on 4 upvotes really shows me how triggered you bears are.
