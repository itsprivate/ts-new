This is not financial advice, but was hoping it might be useful to some of you out there posting massive loss porn and blown up accounts. \n\nStep 1: Deposit $25k into trading account. Find your edge day trading, swing trading, low DTE weeklies trading, scalping, etc. \n\nStep 2: Start out by risking no more than 3% of your account on any given trade. Ensure you take profits at predetermined targets and reduce position of trade going your way and set stop losses no higher than 5% from entry. \n\nStep 3: Execute a couple great trades and double your account in 2 months. Then become completely cocky and throw all your trading rules out the window and start risking 50% plus account size on retarded trades. \n\nStep 4: Either win a big trade like this and get ready to lose more or lose a trade and start chasing even riskier trades. Blow up your account. \n\nStep 5: Deposit $750k into trading account. \n\nHope this is useful!",
