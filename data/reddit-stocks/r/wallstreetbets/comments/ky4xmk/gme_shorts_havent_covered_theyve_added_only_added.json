The number of shares on loan reported from brokers that sell their data actually increased by millions both January 13 and January 14, entailing a record high GME estimated short interest of <strong><em>79.52 million</em></strong> as of the end of yesterday:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m0121tftgkb61.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03d73216a73dc28bac4067faa30df717515cbb23\">https://preview.redd.it/m0121tftgkb61.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03d73216a73dc28bac4067faa30df717515cbb23</a></p>\n\n<p>(Today&#39;s data will be available tomorrow.)
