Then with options back to 5k, and now to 50k this year due to cheapass tlry leaps and bcoin investments.  </p>\n\n<p>I was and I still am that same retard from day 1. I just got lucky, and I did learn some things about timing when to go in on option plays</p>\n\n<p>Anyways this post is about how I actually learned what a tax free savings account is, a retirement account is, and about different investments. Aka STONKs, Options, ETFs like ARKG, and yah fuck the rest of the low money shit like mutual funds and index funds. Who the fuck wants 2-10% a year of returns during this eurphoric bull run?</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to consider myself financially illerate. I didn&#39;t know shit about accounting, how to do taxes or how to build wealth. I started trading because I thought I could make some side money. I am also a lazy MF and had a okay job that paid 17/hr. But I was pretty much depressed. </p>\n\n<p>Now I consider myself a well informed retarded gambler. The stock market has literally changed my life for the better, and has completely changed my outlook on money and how the system is there to teach people to work, not to be wealthy. </p>\n\n<p>My fellow autist, you a smarter then most people who don&#39;t know jackshit about how much money you can make on the markets. Most people just give there money to the banks or just do passive investing(I have no issues with this, but missing out on great opportunities is super retarded). </p>\n\n<p>To everyone who wrote dds and gave advice, thank you. I don&#39;t care if it was bad, because I learned a fuck ton because you autist think differently. I am ready to share as much helpful info back!</p>\n\n<p>TLDR:</p>\n\n<p>Love you guys full homo and STONKS and options = 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
