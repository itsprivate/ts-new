  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t know if anyone else noticed, but Friday was kind of a big one for GME. It <strong>ripped face</strong> from $43 up to $75 in the morning session. That was fucking wild, even for this autist&#39;s dream of a stock. </p>\n\n<p>Others have already commented on why this has happened, but I&#39;ll summarize for the dunces in the back. In short, the market makers wrote a <strong>LOT</strong> of OTM calls last week, and then had to buy shares to cover when those calls went ITM around noon. This is what caused the absurd spike from $50 to $75 in just an hour and a half. That&#39;s the <strong>gamma squeeze</strong> that everyone has been talking about, where MM&#39;s couldn&#39;t cover fast enough.</p>\n\n<p>The rest is history, GME closed at $65, and every single call that expired yesterday was ITM. That&#39;s fucking retarded. </p>\n\n<p>What this means, though, is that the MM&#39;s/brokers are going to have to deliver a ridiculous amount of shares when these expired options settle. Typically, settlement is on Tuesdays. I&#39;ve read estimates that 10-15M shares worth of calls expires ITM last Friday. Again, this is fucking retarded. </p>\n\n<p>Please note that <strong>none</strong> of the above movement relates directly to the short squeeze... but it will. Because there are now 10-15M shares tied up in the clearing houses, there are now even <strong>fewer</strong> shares to be borrowed. There are estimates that the true short interest on this stock was around 300%. Now, with about 20% of the total float <strong>committed to the fucking clearing house</strong> as they sort out Friday&#39;s shitshow, I expect true short interest is closer to 500%. </p>\n\n<p>Demand for GME will continue to pump on Monday. This is a cultural event now, where every lay person can be a modern-day Robin Hood. The shorts are going to have their positions closed whether they like it or not if this continues (which it will). Since there are far <em>far</em> <strong>far</strong> fewer shares floating over the next 2 trading days, though, a squeeze on Monday or Tuesday could utterly destroy Melvin and the other shorts. </p>\n\n<p>If RC even opens his twitter app this weekend, it&#39;s over. </p>\n\n<p>Positions: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/7ipopDo\">Take what&#39;s yours, gents.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
