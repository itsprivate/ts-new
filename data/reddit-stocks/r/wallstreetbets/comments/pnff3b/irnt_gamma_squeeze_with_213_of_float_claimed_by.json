  "selftext": "I've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions & lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a \"pre-squeeze\" movement, there is likely far more to come.\n4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.\n5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, ~~so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13%~~ Ihor's tweet new tweet puts SI at 56% of float with the same elevated cost to borrow.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO & $GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nBe warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.\n\nCredit for the original DD on this goes to /u/Undercover_in_SF \\-- His posts are what turned me onto the low float.\n\nEDIT #1: Per Ihor's tweet, SI is at 728.46K shares, which puts current SI at 56% of float. [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) \\-- I have reached out to ORTEX to confirm their numbers which put SI at a significantly higher 5.11M.\n\nEDIT #2: ORTEX has confirmed that the 5.11M data is incorrect due to a mismatch with current loans and exchange reported short interest. After review, it looks like Ihor's tweet is accurately portraying current short interest and the 56% of float stands for now. Big thanks to ORTEX who are always incredibly helpful. This brings the total institutional obligations to 235% of FF as of today.",
