The following  is a summarization of my answer.  \n\n\nMy Thesis on this Play is as follows -  \nI have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..\n\n  \nAfter the BBBY URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal play. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and a subsequent -50% day and news of the CEO stepped down, the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.\n\n  \n…Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in March) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it’s lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- “Buy Buy Baby”. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated.\n\n  \nWith GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am, and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces of Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which he executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market.                         (Especially considering RC’s cost basis is $15, in addition to the millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options he holds, expiring January 23.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RC VENTURES BBBY HOLDINGS](https://preview.redd.it/6fyertmk3fg91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478d80696050b72babda6908d275b968acd075ca)\n\n  \nAs GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon.  \nThat said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen factor.\n\n  \nAgain, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I’m glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August.\n\n  \nSo again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of “meme basket” and bed Bath &amp; beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop.\n\n  \nSo back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME’s stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.\n\n  \nI waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time… either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here.\n\n  \nAs things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.  \nThen last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BBBY Short Percentage of Float](https://preview.redd.it/a0qkfrw44fg91.jpg?width=541&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8705b60271ccf02b2958658978c4855929a5d279)\n\n  \nAfter watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post… I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)….  \nAnyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.\n\n  \nThe stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.  \nSo yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.  \nEventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.\n\n  \nThursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.\n\n  \nFriday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.  \nSo yeah… I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.  \nAgain, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of “MOASS” like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.\n\n  \nAs one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.  \n It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.\n\n  \nIn closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, **You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.** As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) **I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.** I wouldn’t go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).\n\n  \nFor anyone interested in the statistics on short interest end all around holdings I would urge you to check out - w w w. byebyeshorts . c o m\n\n  \nIn regards to the Yolo…\n\n  \nI Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, &amp; the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight.  \nI decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why….  \nMuch love everyone! Let’s get this sub Reddit back to what it used to be, which was a place to share information about profitable investments, and A hub for novice and experienced investors alike to help each other make money! So let’s make some fucking money, retards!\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Also, this is 100% absolutely not financial advice in any way shape or form. I am literally a retarded person, and am more qualified to give open heart surgery than I am to advise anyone on this earth what to do with their money. \\*\\*",

That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a0qkfrw44fg91.jpg?width=541&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8705b60271ccf02b2958658978c4855929a5d279\"&gt;BBBY Short Percentage of Float&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post… I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)….&lt;br/&gt;\nAnyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.&lt;br/&gt;\nEventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo yeah… I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.&lt;br/&gt;\nAgain, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of “MOASS” like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.&lt;br/&gt;\n It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, &lt;strong&gt;You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.&lt;/strong&gt; As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) &lt;strong&gt;I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn’t go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in the statistics on short interest end all around holdings I would urge you to check out - w w w. byebyeshorts . c o m&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In regards to the Yolo…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, &amp;amp; the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight.&lt;br/&gt;\nI decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why….&lt;br/&gt;\nMuch love everyone! Let’s get this sub Reddit back to what it used to be, which was a place to share information about profitable investments, and A hub for novice and experienced investors alike to help each other make money! So let’s make some fucking money, retards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;******Also, this is 100% absolutely not financial advice in any way shape or form. I am literally a retarded person, and am more qualified to give open heart surgery than I am to advise anyone on this earth what to do with their money. **&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
