The company definitely has untapped potential and could prove to be a succes story in the long-term. They have physical assets that are valued at billions of dollars,  nationwide brand recognition and most importantly they have a separate brand(business) that  they own  that by itself could be worth more than the whole company.  \"Buy Baby\" by itself generated more than 1 billion in sales, with 50 percent of sales generated online. The high short interest and the meme investing craze started by GME  is just the cherry on top. \n\nHaving said that, I am well aware of the fact that gains might not come very soon and I am prepared to handle the volatility. A near term potential catalyst is the expected update at the end of August from the management about the company's current condition and the steps that have been taken for its restructuring. Nevertheless, as a European guy I am seeing a lot of retail investors from Europe having an interest in BBBY and I can assure you that a lot of us are ready to diamond hand our shares alongside our bros across the ocean.\n\nPS: Investing in a business like BBBY that is struggling to say the least is extremely risky and is not recommended for people who have moderate to low risk tolerance. Invest at your own risk. \n\nBBBY to the moon and beyond 🌚🚀🚀🚀",
