Every night, I can feel my leg... and my arm... even my fingers.... the body I’ve lost... the comrades we’ve all lost... won’t stop hurting... it’s like they’re all still there. You feel it too, don’t you?</p>\n\n<p>Currently down 72.55%, still hanging on. AMC has mitigated bankruptcy so I’ll make it back sooner or later, but not gonna lie having diamond hands is rough some days. I dedicated a pretty small portion of my portfolio to AMC/GME and am still holding. Dumped in $2.7k sitting at a whopping $730 as of writing this. We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we’ll see a rebound. So I’ll keep holding</p>\n\n<p>Position: 107 shares &amp; 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $80.12 avg, holding out there too</p>\n\n<p>Edit: stop telling me to sell. I’m not a pussy and would rather lose 100% than sell and admit I made a mistake</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: to the guy who said “AMC just sells overpriced popcorn and the ability to sit in a seat” but who’s comment was deleted: Uhh, yeah. No shit Sherlock. Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it’ll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe. Situations like this is just a roulette table but there’s a small weak magnet under all the numbers where we lose money. Go look it up if you want, or laugh at my pain, I genuinely could not care less</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: <strong>Were going up after hours +2.18%</strong> this is it boys <em>and girls</em>, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. tomorrow could be the day it rises up to $420.69, here are some rockets to signify my strong belief in the underlying company and my love for the stock 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
