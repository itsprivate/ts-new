It's been running around probably for several weeks and we just now know what we're looking for. It's popped up in 3 different continents outside Africa in the four-ish days since it was publicly announced so you can safely say these new cases are not the first.\n\nI'm not saying it'll get as bad as delta, but you can bet your already fisted asses that governments are going to impose a shitload of overreactive (potentially who knows right now) restrictions.\n\nVery bullish for covid stonks. Dow might continue to shit the bed and drag spy with it, but ol' nassy should bounce.\n\nBy the by, I'm not an epidemiologist, but I do covid testing in a hospital so i do have some actual knowledge in the area. It is really fucking hard to track variants because most people who walk through our doors that get tested never have samples sent to the state. If it's positive we do 0 further investigation and I've worked in several facilities in the country who follow the same protocol. Most of the cost efficient and widely used tests (see Abbott Id now) don't go any further than testing for all variants and it would be really impractical to go further and send every positive sample out. \n\nEarly covid we had to send samples to the state labs or ref labs and it would take 8 to 10 days to get results back. We won't run into this issue specifically again, but if we were to send out every positive sample for specific genotyping would likely develop a decent backlog. After a certain period it does very little good because by the time we know we need to do contact tracing it's already spread once, maybe twice depending on how backlogged they get. Not to mention that biotech companies would have to design and manufacture en mass the kits to do it. The lag there would put us in the middle of a wave if this thing really ramps up. Now it is easy to design new pcr primers, but again you still need them in bulk and it's really tough to do it in a high throughput capacity because it actually takes skilled labor which we are really, really short on.\n\nTl;Dr it very likely in multiple states and we will see it pop up widely in a couple weeks if it spreads as fast or faster than delta. It's hard to track properly and there will be a shitload of fear-mongering and knee jerk reactions. \n\n🚀 🚀 🚀  covid stonks over the coming weeks.",
