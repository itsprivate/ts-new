This is meant to be a basic introduction to options prices. I am not a financial professional and this should not be misconstrued as investment advice. </p>\n\n<p>This will probably be long so <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Stop throwing away your money and learn about what you&#39;re buying. If you don&#39;t want to read <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmQ20J_3K7Q&amp;list=PLPVve34yolHY43YaBegHMzN9WjrTnQfFr&amp;ab_channel=tastytrade\">mike and his whiteboard</a> is a good resource (I am not affiliated in any way). </p>\n\n<p>Initially wrote this at the end but I think it&#39;s better at the beginning:</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Practical Applications, General Advice</strong></h2>\n\n<p>General pointers for the newbies. Most of the option trading shown on WSB is OTM naked calls or puts with expiration &lt; 3 weeks (<em>FDs</em>). <strong>These are like lotto tickets and are not considered responsible investments by anyone, including us. They are retarded and we know it. You should know it too before buying.</strong> Theta is usually insane and probability you make money is slim. On the flip side, selling these options is sometimes considered ok but is often <strong>referred to as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller</strong> due to the low return for high risk. If you want to preserve your hard earned money, make responsible plays. With options that usually means <strong>~3 months minimum expiration, and strikes somewhat close to the money, if not in the money.</strong> Consider the implications of IV in your trades, and make sure you understand the mechanics of the options before opening spreads. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Options Basics</p>\n\n<p>An option is a contract that gives you the option to buy (<strong>call</strong>) or sell (<strong>put</strong>) 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (the <strong>strike price</strong>) at or before a certain date (the <strong>expiration date</strong>). Options are priced <strong>per share</strong>, so a call with a listed price of $1 will cost you $100 total for 1 contract ($1 x 100 shares). For American style options (what most of you are trading) you can exercise at any time before the strike price, while European options (which are sold for major indices on American markets) can only be exercised on the expiration date. That doesn&#39;t matter too much for our purposes but I&#39;ll get into that later (EDIT: I never elaborated. This is really only important for <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boxspread.asp#:%7E:text=A%20box%20spread%20is%20an,strike%20prices%20and%20expiration%20dates.\">box spreads</a>. They aren&#39;t allowed on RH and have their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zW86yXg7RM&amp;ab_channel=MHFIN\">own history here</a>. Don&#39;t bother with them). </p>\n\n<p>Options have both intrinsic and extrinsic value. <strong>Intrinsic value</strong> is what that option would be worth at expiration. For example, if you have a $60 call in gamestop, and gamestop stock is at $65, your intrinsic value is $65-$60 = $5 (the difference your strike price vs what price you can sell it on the open market). An option will only have intrinsic value if it is <strong>in the money (ITM)</strong>, which means price is above strike for calls and below strike for puts. <strong>Extrinsic value</strong> is the time value of the option, and will vary based on the <strong>implied volatility (IV)</strong> of the option. The definition of implied volatility is complicated and tends towards circular logic if you apply it practically, but generally it can be thought of as how much options traders expect the underlying to move. If the stock moves a lot, IV goes up. If there&#39;s a big event, like an earnings report, IV goes up. If that earnings report passes, or the stock stabilizes, IV goes down. IV varies greatly depending from one stock to another and can change drastically depending on numerous circumstances, but as a generalization anything &lt; 30% IV could be considered low and anything &gt; 100% IV could be considered high. <strong>Out of the money</strong> options (price below strike for calls and above strike for puts), have value that is entirely extrinsic- for that reason they tend to have larger percent moves than ITM options. </p>\n\n<p>Greeks </p>\n\n<p>The greeks can be an intimidating topic but are extremely important if you want to trade spreads (more on this later) and I would argue anyone buying options should have a basic understanding of the greeks. This will be geared towards average/wsb investors, I&#39;m not going to get into the other greeks here because they usually aren&#39;t as important for our purposes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Delta</strong>: How much the option price will move relative to moves in the the share price. Positive for calls and negative for puts. It ranges 0-1, delta of 1 is equivalent to holding 100 shares, delta 0.5 is equivalent of holding 50 shares. Simple enough. This will increase as you are in the money and decrease if you are out of the money. An at the money option will typically have 0.5 delta, a far ITM option will have delta close to 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theta</strong>: How much time value the option will lose per day. This is &gt;0 (technically &lt;0 if you are short, more on this later). A theta of 0.1 means the value of the option will lose $0.10/share/day, or $10/day. Theta increases as the expiration date becomes closer, so an option expiring this week will lose more money/day than one expiring next month (given same strike). For options of the same expirations, it will typically highest at the money and decreases as you move further ITM or OTM. [EDIT: Corrected]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Rate of change of delta. This represents how much delta will change as the stock price moves. This is highest for near the money options and lowest for far ITM or far OTM options. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Change in option price relative to on change in IV. High vega means the price moves a lot with changes in IV. This will increase with the amount of time left on the contract (more time = higher vega) and is typically highest at the money strikes and lowest for far ITM or OTM strikes. </p>\n\n<p>Buying/Selling Options</p>\n\n<p>Just like stocks you can buy or sell individual contracts. You can also create positions that combine both long and short options, these are known as spreads. Individual contracts are fairly easy to understand and trade, though they typically come with higher risk and higher reward than their spread counterparts. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Long vs Short:</strong> You can buy or sell options. Buyers can sell or exercise their contracts to close the position. Buyers need the stock price to move for their position to profit. Shorts can buy to close or wait for the option to expire. They will profit if the price stays the same (from theta) or moves in their favor. Increases in IV will help longs and hurt shorts, decreases in IV will hurt longs and help shorts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Calls:</strong> Bulls buy calls. Their maximum loss is the initial cost of the call, their max profit is uncapped. They lose theta. Bears can sell calls (<strong>naked calls</strong>), their maximum loss is unlimited and their max profit is the initial price of the call. They gain theta.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puts:</strong> Bears buy puts. Their max loss is the initial price of their put, their max profit is the strike price (stock can&#39;t go lower than zero), they lose theta. Bulls can sell puts (<strong>naked puts</strong>), their maximum loss is the strike price of the contract (stock price can&#39;t go below zero) minus the initial cost of the contract, their max profit is the initial price of the put. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Spreads:</strong> Combination of a buy and a sell. These come in all different forms and allow all sorts of strategies that are impossible with shares or naked positions. In general there are <strong>credit spreads</strong> which is when you sell the spread and receive money up front, and <strong>debit spreads</strong>, which you buy the spread pay up front. When constructing spreads it&#39;s useful to know that the resulting greeks will be the sum of the greeks from all the contracts in the spread. So if you buy a call with delta 0.5 and sell a call with delta 0.25, your overall delta is 0.5-0.25=0.25. I&#39;m only going to cover a few here because I&#39;m getting tired but just know there are a ton of options trading strategies out there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vertical Spread:</strong> Buy and sell different strikes at the same expiration. For example, if I&#39;m bullish on GME I can buy $60 calls and sell $65 calls for 1/29 (debit spread). The cost of the $60 call is offset by the $65, but the profit is capped at $5 per contract. Theta is lower (and can be negative) although delta and gamma are also lower. It&#39;s important to note that when the position is ITM, the overall spread price will be less than the intrinsic value of the spread due to the extrinsic value of the short leg (until you&#39;re insanely far ITM). For example, that $60-65 vertical spread will be worth &lt;$5 even if GME is $75. The price of the spread will approach its intrinsic value as the remaining time on the contract approaches 0. I can also sell a vertical spread (credit spread), I will receive the difference in value of the two contracts and will need cash collateral to cover the difference between the strikes. For example, I can sell a $65 put and buy a $60 put. Since the $65 put is worth more I receive a credit (lets say $200), then I also need to put up $300 in additional collateral. If GME goes above $65 I can wait for the contract to expire useless or buy it back for cheaper than I sold it. If it goes below $65 my loses are offset by the $200 credit. If it goes below $60 my losses are capped at $300 by my long put (I buy shares at 65, sell at 60) and initial credit received.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Iron condor:</strong> Combination of two OTM vertical spreads, typically of the same width. Most people trade these short, the nice thing about that is your collateral can be shared between the call and put side, because there is no way for both sides to be ITM at the same time. If you&#39;re short you make money if stock price stays the same or if volatility goes down (basically the same thing). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Horizontal spreads:</strong> Buy and sell the same strike at different expirations. AKA calendar spreads. Most useful for betting on changes in volatility. A long calendar spread (sell close expiration buy long) will be long volatility, a short calendar spread (buy close expiration sell long) is short volatility. You can also use this strategy for earnings plays, when you know the short dated options will lose more volatility than long dated options. These are most valuable near the money and will lose value as they go farther ITM or OTM. For this reason some traders will incorporate both OTM puts and calls into these positions. Calls are delta neutral at the money, slightly delta positive OTM, and slightly delta negative ITM (reverse for puts). </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all I have the energy for. Feel free to ask questions. Good luck out there. </p>\n\n<p>Positions: GME shares 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: fixed a couple mistakes and added rockets.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2a2j8/options_explained_a_quick_beginners_guide/\">Another post in case you&#39;re interested in learning more.</a>\nEDIT: Fixed differences in theta at same expiration.
