The federal government doesn't give a fuck about you\n2. there is no housing shortage\n3. business is taking over single family homes\n4. you are going to rent forever... thats your future, and you better like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe federal government has been posting lies about a housing shortages across America.   \nThis is simply not true. There is more than enough houses to meet demand of individuals. please note I fucking said **individuals**. \n\n  \n**First let me ask you this.**   \nIf banks are increasing mortgage interest rates 2+ months before any \"rate hikes\" by the FED, is it the banks preparing for the rate hikes, or are they trying to squeeze out the individual home buyer, so the big businesses can hide cash in assets when the market tanks?  Hint: It's the latter. A bank gets much more incentives from the federal government to protect businesses than individuals and thats whats fucking happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof there is no shortage is in the math:\n\nAll data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.\n\nIn 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%. In 2021 it's at 65%. A decrease of 4%. In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US. In 2021 it's 141 million.\n\nUS population in 2004 was 292 million. In 2021 it's 331 million.  \nThrow all these numbers into a blender and you get:  \nA 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.\n\nYes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped. So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from? We'll get to that.\n\n**Are people making more money?**  \nNope. Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021. The jury is still out on the whole bullshit wage inflation thing.  \nBut in real terms wages are down (cost of goods vs pay).\n\n**Is it immigrants?**  \nNope, immigration has been falling for years.\n\n**Is it young people starting families?**  \nNope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.\n\n**Is it inflation?**  \nNope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.\n\nSo basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units slowed down during COVID but is ramping up- 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  \nJan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  \nMay 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.\n\n  \nSo, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:  \n\n\nPrices: Up.  \nWages: Down.  \nSupply relative to population: Up.  \nDemand: Down.  \nSales: Down.  \nConstruction: Down.  \nFirst time homebuyers 2021: 30% (the lowest in recorded history per National Association of Realtors)  \n\n\n**Now lets talk about WHO is buying homes**\n\nWe already know**, it's businesses hiding cash as assets in single family homes**. Look at the home buyer rates. Look at all these public companies with new capital assets on their books. Look at fucking Blackstone (blackrock). Shit open up [apartments.com](https://apartments.com) or [padmapper.com](https://padmapper.com) and check out all the new houses for rent.\n\nThe fun fact about these companies hiding cash in capital assets is that a shitload of them are foreign or llc's and partnerships with foreign holders. Thats right a lot of these homes not sold to an ibuyer, or hedge funds are being given away to foreign investment firms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**how can we fix this? how can we save the American dream?**\n\n**Vote?**   \nfuck i don't know. garbage in garbage out. they are in the pockets of business thanks to citizens united.\n\n**Tax?**  \ncreate a vacant property tax.  \ntax businesses more that own and rent single family homes.  \nGet rid of the vacant unit tax write-offs  \nGet rid of the accelerated depreciation on single family homes.  \nblock foreign owned firms and businesses, without US citizens as partners, from owning single family homes.  \nForce banks to have competitive loan rates when it comes to businesses buying resident assets vs individuals buying homes. why do they get 1% interest while i have perfect credit and they now want 4%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis is a rant... let's get some discussion going. thoughts? opinions?  \n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d65xjovcami81.gif",
