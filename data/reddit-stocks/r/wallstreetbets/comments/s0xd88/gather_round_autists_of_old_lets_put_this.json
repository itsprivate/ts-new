This sub has ALWAYS had autists yoloing because \"Fuck it\" and \"Lambos or Ramen\". Anyone remember the cult following behind TSLA? We ALL made tendies - the true autists anyways. It had waaaayy more media hate than GME does now and every TSLA yolo was considered way riskier than GME is today. I remember the TSLA crash from 180 to $85 and I kept buying more like a true autist. Look at it today.. however, NO ONE can argue that TSLA's price today stands today on its fundamentals, not even a little bit. It's been all about retail sentiment and meme status. \n\nRegardless of you feel that GME today stands on its fundamentals, future growth, or meme status these are the facts: \n\nGME reported approx 5.2 million shares DRS'd by apes as of October 30, 2021 during their last 10q Q3 report. \n\nCurrent Reddit scraper counts 8 million shares as a low-end estimate of DRS'd shares today. \n\nAND.. DRSbot counts approximately 17 million shares DRS'd by apes as of today as a formula estimation of average shares and computershare high score account number. THATS &gt; 50% OF THE FLOAT! \n\nlastly, this week has already started seeing 30% price volatility.\n\nEither join the movement and buy some long-term calls to add buying pressure to your bet or sit by and watch this one slip between your fingers just like TSLA, AMD, and MSFT,  which were all heavily pushed here in a \"cult-like\" way. \n\nNot financial advice. I take heavy prescription meds and I'm literally not even allowed to even drive. \n\nPosition: 250 GME shares.\n\nEdit: since yall like to say I have a small position, it let's you know I'm interested but not fully committed.  Im currently enjoying my retirement thanks to this sub and just trying to support my alcohol addiction now that I don't work.\n\nEdit 2: I spent all night trying to commenting on everything from \"Shut the fuck up\" to \"sits down cross legged, leaning in\" to \"how can you compare TSLA to GME?\" to \"you're not retired\" LMAO, anyways sorry if I missed you. If you've thought about it, it's probably already down in the comments with my attempt at a reasonable response.. TLDR is be nice autists and see opportunity when it presents itself.. Some clarity, the 50% comes from also subtracting insider shares, ETFs, and etc. Lastly, if apes DRSing nearly 50% of the FLOAT isn't the most gloriously retarded thing you've ever seen and doesn't have you itching to buy some calls on volatility alone then I don't know why you're here.",
