BBBY is on RegSho list, for any new regards without wrinkles, this means the hedgecucks are fucked.\n\nAll you need to do is hold.\n\nWhy is Regsho so massive? Well first of all, it clears the market makers of all obligations to deliver FTD'S in the regular t+2 timeframe. Wait... that sounds bad? No regard listen the fuck up.\n\nMM's NOW have t+13 from the date of RegSho to deliver ALL FTD'S, otherwise on the 13th date forced buying of EVERY FUCKING UNDELIVERED SHARE begins.\n\nDo you honestly think when you went into your broker and bought shares that it had any affect on price action? Absolutely fucking not.\n\nSusfuckquehanna and Citadel are HOPING that you paper hand your god damn shares before that 13th date so they never actually have to buy and deliver on the open market (BBBY went regsho on the 16th so t+13 is SEPTEMBER 2ND.)\n\nIf you do not sell forced buying will occur on all those shares that never actually got delivered, and this fucker will moonshot to kingdom come.\n\nHow can you help?\n\n1. Buy more fucking shares. Don't stop. Every dip buy more and hold. \n2. Buy ITM or JUST OTM options for September-January to gamma squeeze these cunts.\n\nLet's fucking get this bag.\n\nEdit: What happened with GME is we saw a cyclical event happen after RegSho. Forced buying drove MASSIVE amounts of price action, which incited massive amount of fomo, which drove more FTD's to be forced delivered, more FOMO, etc. You get the picture.\n\nThis cyclical market mechanic is what was going to send GME to the thousands, but we all know what happened after the buy button turned off. Demand was artifically gone, and the obligation to deliver shares was DECIMATED as apes sold and cash settled their options.\n\nOnce again, LETS GET THIS BAG.\n\nLast edit:  For regards who need proof of T+13 -  \"In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.\"\n\nLast last edit: For every one shill negative comment on this post, there is 100 positive comments. I fucking love this community and I truly have not seen this level of POSITIVE FUCKING SENTIMENT around a single stock since GME squeezed. This is it. \n\nHow high will it go? Who the fuck knows but I’m aiming at $80 at the very LEAST, and you already know Ryan Cohen is too with those big dick Jan 80 calls. Trust the process, buy your fucking SHARES (and some options) and get rich.",
