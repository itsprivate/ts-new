Tax information related to this stock split can be found [here](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/1764b8e4-0e1d-41a6-b502-8c5ab7604dc8).\n\n**GameStop Guidance for International Stockholders with Split-Related Questions** ¬†¬†\n\n*GameStop has notified its transfer agent and the Depository Trust Company (‚ÄúDTC‚Äù) that some of our valued stockholders in international geographies are still trying to determine if they have received the proper stock dividend associated with the Company‚Äôs recent 4-for-1 stock split. Please note GameStop has already distributed the shares of common stock required for the stock dividend to its transfer agent, which has confirmed it subsequently distributed the appropriate number of shares of common stock to DTC for allocation to brokerage firms and other participants. We recommend that stockholders using a brokerage firm contact that firm with needs or questions. Stockholders may want to make their brokerage firm aware if they recently moved shares to the Company‚Äôs direct registered list, as we have been informed this move could impact a firm‚Äôs distribution of shares.* ¬†\n\n*As always, we appreciate your investment and enthusiasm. Although we are not able to engage with individual brokerage firms, we are monitoring this situation and will keep you informed of any relevant updates we obtain through our transfer agent or DTC.*",
