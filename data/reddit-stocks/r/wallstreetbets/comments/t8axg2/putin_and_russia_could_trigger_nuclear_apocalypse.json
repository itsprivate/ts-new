The International Monetary Fund has warned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the international sanctions it has sparked will have a \"severe impact\" on the global economy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Berezin also predicted there could be a sharp sell-off of assets in coming weeks as happened two years ago during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Even if World War III is ultimately averted, markets could experience a freak-out moment over the next few weeks, similar to what happened at the outset of the pandemic.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Stock markets have soared over the last two years, awash with cash following pandemic-era stimulus measures and ultra-low interest rates and climbing far beyond pre-pandemic levels.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\"The risk of Armageddon has risen dramatically,\" BCA's note concluded. \"Stay bullish on stocks over a 12-month horizon.\"**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Fed still planned to raise interest rates this month for the first time in three years despite the global economic shock of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pointing to high inflation, a tight labor market and strong economic demand.\n\nVia: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/03/06/vladimir-putin-and-russia-could-trigger-nuclear-apocalypse-and-armageddon-but-investors-told-to-stay-bullish](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/03/06/vladimir-putin-and-russia-could-trigger-nuclear-apocalypse-and-armageddon-but-investors-told-to-stay-bullish)",
