I got the job right away, which was kinda suprising given my questionable trading knowlege and history. All I had to do was to take a simple aptitude test that checked my mental health, visionary goals and outlook on life and passed it with flying colours. Who knew?\n\nAnyway my first day came along and I was expecting the hedge fund to be an absolute boiler room of testostorone, swearing, crazy money and cocaine snorted off the buttcracks of hookers.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nWhat an absolutely lovely environment to work in. When you walk in the door they greet you in the most pleasent way i've ever been greeted when entering a company. The butler hands you a lovely hot towel smelling of jasmine before you head to your desk.\n\nThe other trades were so humble, one of them was trading just so that he could pay for his grandmother's medical bills. Another was donating his entire salary to the homeless and living out of the back of his car. He didn't even drive a Lambo as well, it was a 12 year old Honda Civic.\n\nEvery Friday the boss's secretary bakes cupcakes with dollar signs on them and gives them out to everyone in the morning. She's met with praise and admiration from everyone.\n\nAnd that's not even the best bit. They do a monthly raffle, where everyone buys tickets for $10k each and the person who wins get to choose which orphanage to give all the money to.\n\nWere we wrong about hedge funds guys?\n\n^(Mods please mark this post with the appropriate shitpost flair.)",
