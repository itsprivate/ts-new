If the answer is yes hold, if no sell. </p>\n\n<p>2.5) find a stock that you think will perform better than your current investments? Sell a position and diversify</p>\n\n<p>3) Recognise when a stock is dead. If everyone says it’s going up. It’s reached the top. </p>\n\n<p>4) Diversify retard. At the end of the day long-term options and shares are the best bet. Not fucking OTM weekly FDs\nNot financial advice just sharing my opinion. </p>\n\n<p>PS: <a href=\"/u/MartyMoho\">u/MartyMoho</a> made a post that auto moderator removed for my OG boys.
