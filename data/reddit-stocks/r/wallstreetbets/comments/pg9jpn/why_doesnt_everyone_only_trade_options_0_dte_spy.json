WSB has introduced me to the great world of options, and it has completely changed my life. \n\n**Pre-WSB**\nI am ashamed to admit… but I used to be a… *Boglehead*. In my early investing days (~5 months ago) the dinosaur Vanguard lentil eaters told me it is *impossible* to beat the market. They all accepted an early defeat that they’ll never be rich, so they default to 6% yearly returns and averaging into the occasional 40% crash. Rather than risking my money on something *totally risky* like Apple (which holds $300B+ in cash and literally only goes up), I should own Apple and 5000 other companies that nobody knows or cares about.\n\nUnfortunately, these boomers convinced me and I threw my entire portfolio into VT and BND. “Own the market and you will get rich…. when you’re 500 years old”. After holding for 2 weeks and losing 1.3%, I sold all my shares and started a new adventure. \n\n\n**Learning from WSB**\nAs I came to WSB, I saw a skilled trader lose $100k in seconds. His life: destroyed. In the next post, I saw another investor make $100k in seconds. His life: changed! I was in awe. The Bogleheads made me lose 1.2% of my account and told me to “hold for the next 60 years”. Meanwhile I saw someone make 10,000% in a few minutes on some SPY calls. So I did what any logical person would do and opened a Robinhood account. I promptly applied for options, and Vlad personally gave me approval. He told me that life in Bulgaria was very difficult, but through options he was able to get out of the poor eurozone and into the United States. \n\nMy first trade was a massive success. I made 20% on an SPY call. I made 3 years worth of the Bogleheads dream in minutes. These losers can’t compete. In the subsequent few months, I have 100x my account. Through a series of 0-1 DTE SPY calls, I have found great success trading complex financial derivatives that I do not understand. It’s amazing. My life has been changed and I cannot thank WSB enough. \n\n\n**THANK YOU**\nI would like to thank WSB for fundamentally changing my life. Not only have you made me 100x richer, but you have taught me the importance of risk taking. I would still be a Vanguard boglehead loser if I didn’t discover the power of 0-1DTE SPY calls (I do not buy puts since they’re anti-American 🇺🇸🦅💪). If WSB was not filled with such intellectuals, I would have not trusted the numerous great DDs.\n\nThis leads me to my question:\n**Why doesn’t everyone trade options?**\nI don’t think it makes sense to buy and hold something for DECADES and hope for a 100% return after 20 years. I have made 100x in 3 months and could not imagine how pathetic I would look still holding VT and BND. I have leveraged all my accounts through a series of all in trades. I now have a Tesla arriving soon all thanks to the YOLO and WSB. \n\nWhy doesn’t everyone do this?! It seems like free money.",
