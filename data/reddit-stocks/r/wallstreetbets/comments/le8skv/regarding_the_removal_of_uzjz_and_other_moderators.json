According to reddit, the top mods of the community were removed for violating rule 5 of the moderator guidelines, which is: &quot;healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins.&quot; The attempt of the top mods to remove all of us and censor you failed, thanks to the actions of the reddit admins. We are grateful to everyone in the community who stood up for us.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"/u/zjz\">/u/zjz</a> will also not be allowed to come back to moderate the subreddit. This is a decision made by reddit, not us, due to the instability that was created by his last post on the subreddit. We know the respect that you all have for him, each one of us mods has that respect for him too. The hard work and time that <a href=\"/u/zjz\">/u/zjz</a> put into the subreddit cannot be replaced, but we will try our best to keep the subreddit up to his lofty standards and our high expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward, we are working harder than ever and we need your help. Since <a href=\"/u/zjz\">/u/zjz</a> ran all of our bots and was also the most active mod, there is a massive void left by his absence. If anyone has the desire to code a new bot for us and/or the time to moderate, as well as the experience on WSB (at least one year), we would appreciate your help.</p>\n\n<p>Do not harass any former moderators. We need to move on from this and put it behind us all. This is the best community on reddit, let&#39;s keep it that way.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gBFWFVm\">Proof</a>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
