  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>PART 1: Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I might be the guy who used his emergency fund to take out puts on SPY, why would you blindly listen to me? Trading is a hobby for me and I hope to share a potentially great find with you all and teach some new skills along the way</p>\n\n<p>This might not be the first time you have heard of Lordstown Motors ($RIDE). It seems people are finally starting to warm up to the company now that some positive news has come out, and I’m all for it. I’ve been chart watching this for a while and I’m glad people are finally starting to see through the veil of drama and realize being bullish on a prospective company is not some pipe dream, a feeling plenty of you should be familiar with. Because since when do we find Hindenburg Research, literally five dudes with a lot of money and a focus on “activist short selling”, coming in like your wife’s mean boyfriend on Christmas eve to tell you that Santa Clause isn’t real, to be a credible source?</p>\n\n<p>But enough metaphors. Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle focused on developing the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. If any of you are like me, you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon!”, you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock.</p>\n\n<p>So that’s what I intend to do. I won’t give you the same boring old rundown of fundamentals that you get plenty of. If you want some of that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">check out the post that was just made on the subject</a>. Instead, using technical analysis and a bunch of pretty crayon drawings, I will prove that not just I, but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE. I’ve learned that the way to make significant money in this market is to find and bet on <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lordstown-motors-becomes-oversold-ride-2021-04-05\">oversold stocks like $RIDE</a> that have all of the FUD priced in; live and die by the motto “buy the fear, sell the greed”. I believe $RIDE is the type of stock that traders will begin to buy hand over fist in the coming days and weeks, and hopefully I can teach some fresh blood a new skill along the way.</p>\n\n<p>If you find yourself falling asleep at any point, just skip through and look at the pretty pictures like a Dr Seuss book.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PART 2: Technical Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now, as I already laid out, I believe that $RIDE is undervalued, however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone. I prefer to trade on indicators. Many people have told me I read tea leaves, they call me John D Cuckefeller, and if you feel the same then read no further. But it&#39;s no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators, and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Volume and Short Interest:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Before we get into the technical analysis, I’d like to address this sub’s favorite market mechanic: short sales. According to the numbers given to us by <a href=\"https://fintel.io/ss/us/ride\">Fintel</a>, short volume reached its recent peak directly after the short report, and has largely fallen and consolidated since then. Why are we seeing a consolidation period after a short attack? It is my belief that many of the shorts are beginning to take their profits and leave, realizing the stock has the potential for a huge rally. Not only are they scared of people like you, who will target a stock just to hurt short-sellers, but they also realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this, and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their moms house.</p>\n\n<p>Even given all this, $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month, <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RIDE/short-interest/\">to a total of 12.5 percent the total float</a>. And even more interesting to me is the fact that since the recent <a href=\"https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/04/lmc-reveals-endurance-betas/\">reveal of the endurance betas</a> the short volume ratio has increased again to around 24 percent with no significant increase in volume. No significant changes in volume and an increase in short interest from an actual working product? Sounds like a few people had too much of a vested interest in Lordstown being “3-4 years away from production” like the bears claimed.</p>\n\n<p>This is, in my opinion, <em>very significant</em> as it indicates the catalyst is probably not priced into the stock yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Relative Strength</strong></p>\n\n<p>For anyone who’s a fan of indicators, it should be obvious that $RIDE is massively oversold, to the point where demand can’t go anywhere but up. Just look at any relative strength oscillator; many traders use the RSI but I prefer to use the Stochastics. I won’t get too mathematical on you, but this chart essentially shows us the demand of a stock. Pretty simple. $RIDE has been in the 20th percentile oversold range for some time now, and is just starting to creep out now that demand is increasing for the stock. Rumors can’t last forever and the market is showing uncertainty in the current downward momentum. This should be seen as the first sign of renewed investor confidence in the company.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jdeugezrvsr61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a32d3b1fa3326fdff20c09b406c4780db04df869\">The relative strength of $RIDE, shown by Stochastics. More oversold just means more fuel for the explosion</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>MACD:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This indicator line nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form. Don’t overcomplicate this; when the purple line is above the orange line, the stock (often) goes up, and when it’s below the orange line it goes down. Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events. In times of high volatility, violent swings in the MACD above and below the centerline can often result in violent reversals when they cross again. A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a favorite around here; GameStop:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hl89sol1wsr61.jpg?width=1185&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=458e07447e4bc8462a3e6e982d2e67d493010e1d\">MACD analysis on GME. Anyone else remember the massive FUD during this time?</a></p>\n\n<p>I noticed this crossover beginning to form, and that week when everyone was shitting on GME I bought more like any good retard would do. The MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift. The violent downswing below the centerline resulted in a violent upswing, and the rest should be obvious. A crossover event occurred and it rocketed from 40 to 150+ the very next day. I couldn&#39;t predict how much it would go up but one thing was clear: the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more, and in a time of great FUD, I bought more.</p>\n\n<p>Now lets take a look at the MACD for $RIDE. Does the chart below give anyone else Déjà vu? Or did is it just me? Using what we&#39;ve learned about the MACD and seeing the real-world example with GME, just take a look for yourself with $RIDE:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vsf3zynawsr61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0970eb9794859538a9eade2fe7ab539c10842080\">MACD analysis on $RIDE, looking absolutely bullish AF. A thing of beauty 🚀🚀🚀</a></p>\n\n<p>This was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago. Historically, the MACD has predicted massive uptrends before based on being very far below the center. Similarly, we recently had another event that spread mass doubt on $RIDE and pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner (I wonder what it was).</p>\n\n<p>Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks, the MACD line has flattened out and finally crossed the signal line in orange. This is a good sign that negative pressure is decreasing and one thing is for sure, the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term. With the recent dip in the moving average being so far below the centerline, $RIDE is honestly primed for ignition and I&#39;ve been buying. When you see a MACD like this, I don’t really have many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the Great Depression Part 2 is starting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong></p>\n\n<p>PRICE ACTION!!!</p>\n\n<p>The most important indicator of all. It&#39;s easy to get caught up in all the pretty colors and forget about the bigger picture of price action. A change in things like volume and overall trend means more than any indicator, which should be used to contextualize the price action and not the other way around. For the sake of simplicity, I won’t go too far into this one. Individual candlesticks are valuable, but in the bigger picture we can see that the current price seems to be at a historical floor at the moment, and more importantly, the price action and volume is trading in a narrow range of consolidation for the past week or so. Specifically, a breakout above 14 dollars or below 10 could easily spark a much greater movement of volume and price. We don’t need to force anything or look at fancy charts to figure this out, but instead just look at the actions of real market participants.</p>\n\n<p>Combining the price action with the other indicators to give context is where things get really juicy and we can find some unexpected things.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0k28fdixwsr61.png?width=1622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed734f7bac97d0982b7f0791bf4e6df33c3b017\">Positive divergence of the MACD and price action. Momentum is increasing against a bearish price trend, and price is now consolidating before liftoff</a></p>\n\n<p>Instead of the smooth 1-day period chart, we’re looking at a 4-hour period for more details. Notice how the price action has been in a trend down but the MACD has been in a trend up? This is called positive divergence, and is a result of a stocks momentum not agreeing with its current trending direction, which is a pretty big deal. Many traders use divergence in addition to the other indicators to assess the likelihood of a reversal, and based on the other factors and presence of a catalyst, I believe a reversal is being foreshadowed right in front of us. As of just yesterday, April 6th, the divergence resulted in the MACD crossing above the centerline, indicating that the price action has started seeking an uptrend. This is significant reason to believe that a breakout above resistance is much more likely than a crash, a huge amount of upward pressure is building. The price is currently consolidating in an area of low volatility, and though I don’t want to get too far into the Bollinger Band indicator, this could result in a “<a href=\"https://www.tradingsetupsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BollingerandKeltnerSqueezeExample.jpg\">Bollinger Band Squeeze</a>” upwards very soon.</p>\n\n<p>These are the indicators I use for any stock I look at, and for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of $30-$35, and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PART 3: Catalysts and Fundamentals</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since indicators are driven by price action, which is itself driven by catalysts, they usually won’t run far without some sort of news to cling on to. As far as catalysts go, Lordstown did just release their <a href=\"https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas\">beta trucks</a> last week. News which, I cannot stress enough, <em>I DO NOT THINK THIS CATALYST IS PRICED IN YET</em> as discussed earlier. They are also <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/racing/more-racing/a35598958/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/\">showcasing their truck in one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable at the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race</a> in Mexico&#39;s Baja California Peninsula on April 17 (less than 10 days away). Not to mention their market cap when compared to their worse-off competitors. The current price just doesn’t make sense.</p>\n\n<p>I also I like the design of the truck itself; image is everything, especially when compared to some of its competitors (I’m sorry Canoo bulls but wtf is that thing? Not to mention the Cybertruck). Lordstown is targeting commercial fleets and government contracts initially. Yesterday, the Camping World CEO tweeted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20\">leak to an RV that Lordstown is working on</a> (the Lordstown logo is in the center of the wheel) through <a href=\"https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx\">their partnership</a>. The electric RV market could be huge. The catalysts are plenty but the market is still timid, for now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PART 4: Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, I hope you learned a few things from this post, even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here. As I stated, this is not my full-time job; I do this as a hobby. Feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info; I know some of the technical analysis can be confusing. Knowledge is power among the knowledge impaired.</p>\n\n<p>And for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. It has all the same signals that make me love other big names around here, and there is just too much potential for an explosion right now and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this. Lest we all forget <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html\">Morgan Stanley’s 10$ price target on Tesla</a>, have a good $RIDE everyone, and don’t let the short bugs bite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions:</strong> 65 shares at 12.94, 2x $20 07/16C, 1x 15$ 01/21/22c</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Forgot to add, but per page 21 of <a href=\"https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/ef77bce6-b19a-4288-a651-e08089f1362f\">this slide deck</a>, the current replacement value of Lordstown’s 6.2 million square foot factory is over $3 billion, but the current market cap of $RIDE is only $2.01 billion. An EV stock that is trading almost 50% below its asset value? Come on now. Everything I’m seeing is screaming buy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>\n\n<p>I love $RIDE’s pretty charts, and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore. IMO, $RIDE is poised for a breakout, and this is the type of chart that technical traders will begin noticing and placing big bets on. $RIDE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
