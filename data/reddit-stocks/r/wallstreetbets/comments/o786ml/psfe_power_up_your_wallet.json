  "selftext": "# PAYSAFE - PAYMENT SOLUTIONS TO POWER UP YOUR TENDIES\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***What is Paysafe?***\n\n**Paysafe Group** previously known as **Optimal Payments PLC** is a multinational online payments company. The company offers services both under the *Paysafe* brand and subsidiary brands that have become part of the group through several mergers and acquisitions, most notably Neteller, Skrill and paysafecard. **Paysafe** was sold to the Blackstone Group & CVC Partner Capitals making it the **largest private equity** backed takeover of a London listed company since 2007-2008 crisis.\n\nIn December 2020, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to merge with **SPAC** company known as **Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp**, in a **US$9 billion transaction.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***What products do they offer and what do they sell?***\n\nThe company helps businesses and consumers to connect and transact seamlessly through capabilities in payment processing, digital wallet, and other online money transfer solutions.\n\n* Cash online - Accepts cash payments online\n* Direct Debit - Accepts instant, secured bank payments direct from consumers.\n* Digital Wallets - Accepts payment from digital wallets\n* Integrated Payments - They customise and integrate payments for businesses\n* Online Payments - They provide secure & simplified e-commerce solutions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hedge-funds are extremely bullish on $PSFE**\n\nAs we all know, hedge funds deliver the best returns compared to S&P500. Many hedge fund companies showed tremendous growth and performed excellent even during pandemic and post pandemic.\n\nBased on the insidermonkey article, the number of long hedge fund bets on ***Paysafe*** rose by 41, however, please note that PSFE isn't included in the 30 most popular stocks amongst hedgefunds . The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in PSFE over the last 23 quarters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9vxh3ydm9771.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=a929586f1ae33c1d374f11185f8010296e0551ea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's have a look at the top institutional owners for ***Paysafe.*** As you can see from the image below, majority of these companies are hedge funds & private equity firms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bu07noem9771.png?width=2014&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e940758cc3e33ce9f0cd913aed0f3e1acb38c51\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Price targets as per Wall Street Analysts -**\n\n7 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Paysafe in the last 12 months. Their average **twelve-month price target is $17.29**, predicting that the stock has a possible **upside of 54.75%**. The high price target for **PSFE is $19.00** and the **low price target for PSFE is $15.00**.\n\nEven if the company is able to hit a price target of 15$ in the coming weeks, that's a possible of upside of at least **35.13%** based on the current stock price at the time of this DD **($11.10).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i001qrxfm9771.png?width=2618&format=png&auto=webp&s=eebb759ff8a4ef7a5021691f9ccd2170e720aca4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If company is so good, why did it fall 23% in the last 6 months?**\n\nAs all of you may know, the SPAC's were hot and trending back in early 2021 and most of the companies were overpriced. If you look at the price history of all the SPAC's post merger, then you'll notice that most of them fell quite significantly. ***Paysafe*** was one of the top companies that went public through SPAC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why paysafe is a good stock to invests in?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ***Paysafe*** has been delivering what many SPAC's have failed to deliver i.e **Revenues & Profits.** Despite the numbers being good after Q1, the stock still fell by 21%. Paysafe got hit by \"Post merger SPAC effect'.\n* The drop in price due to \"Post Merger SPAC effect\" is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term.\n* Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it's monopoly in the iGaming space. Their biggest competitors PayPal & Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space. Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings, Roblox, Twitch, Caesar's entertainment and many more.\n* When it comes to iGaming space, the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely. People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations.\n* As per nasdaq.com, the company is expected to **exceed $103 billion in transactions** this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **52% through 2025.**\n* The company’s products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square, however, they plan on expanding in the coming years.\n* As per nasdaq.com, The U.S. online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.4% between last year and fiscal year 2025 and ***Paysafe*** has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U.S.\n* The company has expanded partnership with **Coinbase** and the company’s payment solution is in about 27  sites and exchanges. As investing and trading activity grows in the near future, Paysafe is well positioned to benefit.\n* If you look at the Q1, the fundamentals were quite strong, company reported revenue of $377.4 million, which was higher by 5% on a year-on-year basis. The company's adjusted EBITDA was $113.2 million, which implies an EBITDA margin of 30%.\n* The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e-cash solutions segment, adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110% higher and reported $48.1 million. The company reported revenue growth of 63% \\~ $112.9 million.\n* As per nasdaq.com, the e-cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42.6% as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30%. With strong growth in the e-cash segment, it’s likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters. As a matter of fact, Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32% for FY2021\n* Between FY2020 and FY2023, the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about \\~10%. Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U.S online gambling sector.\n* If there is a synergy, Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to grow. The company is currently sitting at $274 million in cash and $225 million in un-drawn credit facility.\n* According to nasdaq.com, Paysafe reported operating cash flow of $48.7 million in Q1. This would imply an annualized OCF of $195 million. With likely EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years, the company is positioned for healthy cash flow growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is the future of iGaming and online transactions?**\n\nThere is no brainer in this question. The iGaming space and etransactions will keep exceeding in the near future. Many countries currently use cash for transactions, but as technology advances, third world countries are expected to go cashless and follow digital payments. As per the article from Juniper Research Ltd, the digital world is projected to exceed $10 Trillion in 2025. This is an 83% increase from 2020. The research also found that contactless and e-commerce payments will increase to 50% of total wallet spend in 2025 from less than 36% in 2020. More than 34% of mobile handsets are also seen to use contactless payments in 2025, up from 11% in 2020. Even a 2 year old baby would know that Paysafe is expected to benefit from this growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStock price during after the merger,\n\nAs you can see from the graph below, the Paysafe stock rocketed right after the merger announcement and shot up to as high as 20$/piece. What happened next should not shock the world because most of the SPAC's fell off post merger. BUT what makes this SPAC unique is the fact that they've been able to pull off revenues and profits and were able to provide better guidance for the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mhhphihm9771.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf8bdfae532f25cde8d25d6d0451e619677c434\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Now, let's talk about Financials of Q1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkld8lqhm9771.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f2180d3bf36f1910b1c8444c294e0ec7326803\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $377.4 million, an increase of 5%, compared to $359.7 million in the prior year. However, gross profit was a bit low compared to 2020.\n\nNet loss for the first quarter was $49.1 million, compared to $51.1 million, in the prior year. The company mentioned in the presentation that Net loss included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $113.2 million, compared to $112.8 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased approximately 140 basis points to 30.0%, but they expect this basis point to go up in the near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Now let's have a look at the segment growth\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, the company absolutely destroyed their growth in ecash solutions and reported an increase in revenue by 63%.\n\n***Integrated Processing -*** Revenue for the first quarter was $176.9 million, a decrease of 5%, compared to $186.2 million in the prior year\n\n***Digital Wallet -*** Revenue for the first quarter was $94.9 million, a decrease of 13%, compared to $108.5 million in the prior year.\n\n***eCash Solutions -*** Revenue for the first quarter was $112.9 million, an increase of 63%, compared to $69.1 million in the prior year\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5j0c4tbim9771.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd8d6574749f955bc4078467f7c02e4364d92ec\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# HIGHER 2021 guidance\n\nThe company reported higher 2021 guidance and are expected to achieve their goals due to increase number of online transactions and growth in iGaming space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4a1jovim9771.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=92278c6b638c9c6db841d7caf993cc4d44cab81a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR -**\n\n**The company is expected to achieve their 2021 guidance.**\n\n**No competition for Paysafe in iGaming space.**\n\n**The stock fell down in the past few months due to \"Post Merger SPAC fatigue\"**\n\n**One of the few SPAC's who actually brings in Revenue & Profits**\n\n**Currently close to 52 week low and a nice opportunity to grab at this current price**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions Screenshot**\n\n**180 share at 11.14$ each**\n\n**45x calls with strike price 12.5$ expiring 7/16.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbnife8om9771.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1a4edf01210e9e443689e10687c2466f8b3fb99\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE!

The company offers services both under the <em>Paysafe</em> brand and subsidiary brands that have become part of the group through several mergers and acquisitions, most notably Neteller, Skrill and paysafecard. <strong>Paysafe</strong> was sold to the Blackstone Group &amp; CVC Partner Capitals making it the <strong>largest private equity</strong> backed takeover of a London listed company since 2007-2008 crisis.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2020, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to merge with <strong>SPAC</strong> company known as <strong>Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp</strong>, in a <strong>US$9 billion transaction.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What products do they offer and what do they sell?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>The company helps businesses and consumers to connect and transact seamlessly through capabilities in payment processing, digital wallet, and other online money transfer solutions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cash online - Accepts cash payments online</li>\n<li>Direct Debit - Accepts instant, secured bank payments direct from consumers.</li>\n<li>Digital Wallets - Accepts payment from digital wallets</li>\n<li>Integrated Payments - They customise and integrate payments for businesses</li>\n<li>Online Payments - They provide secure &amp; simplified e-commerce solutions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hedge-funds are extremely bullish on $PSFE</strong></p>\n\n<p>As we all know, hedge funds deliver the best returns compared to S&amp;P500. Many hedge fund companies showed tremendous growth and performed excellent even during pandemic and post pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the insidermonkey article, the number of long hedge fund bets on <strong><em>Paysafe</em></strong> rose by 41, however, please note that PSFE isn&#39;t included in the 30 most popular stocks amongst hedgefunds . The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in PSFE over the last 23 quarters.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h9vxh3ydm9771.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a929586f1ae33c1d374f11185f8010296e0551ea\">https://preview.redd.it/h9vxh3ydm9771.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a929586f1ae33c1d374f11185f8010296e0551ea</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s have a look at the top institutional owners for <strong><em>Paysafe.</em></strong> As you can see from the image below, majority of these companies are hedge funds &amp; private equity firms.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1bu07noem9771.png?width=2014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e940758cc3e33ce9f0cd913aed0f3e1acb38c51\">https://preview.redd.it/1bu07noem9771.png?width=2014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e940758cc3e33ce9f0cd913aed0f3e1acb38c51</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price targets as per Wall Street Analysts -</strong></p>\n\n<p>7 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Paysafe in the last 12 months. Their average <strong>twelve-month price target is $17.29</strong>, predicting that the stock has a possible <strong>upside of 54.75%</strong>. The high price target for <strong>PSFE is $19.00</strong> and the <strong>low price target for PSFE is $15.00</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the company is able to hit a price target of 15$ in the coming weeks, that&#39;s a possible of upside of at least <strong>35.13%</strong> based on the current stock price at the time of this DD <strong>($11.10).</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i001qrxfm9771.png?width=2618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eebb759ff8a4ef7a5021691f9ccd2170e720aca4\">https://preview.redd.it/i001qrxfm9771.png?width=2618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eebb759ff8a4ef7a5021691f9ccd2170e720aca4</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>If company is so good, why did it fall 23% in the last 6 months?</strong></p>\n\n<p>As all of you may know, the SPAC&#39;s were hot and trending back in early 2021 and most of the companies were overpriced. If you look at the price history of all the SPAC&#39;s post merger, then you&#39;ll notice that most of them fell quite significantly. <strong><em>Paysafe</em></strong> was one of the top companies that went public through SPAC.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why paysafe is a good stock to invests in?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Paysafe</em></strong> has been delivering what many SPAC&#39;s have failed to deliver i.e <strong>Revenues &amp; Profits.</strong> Despite the numbers being good after Q1, the stock still fell by 21%. Paysafe got hit by &quot;Post merger SPAC effect&#39;.</li>\n<li>The drop in price due to &quot;Post Merger SPAC effect&quot; is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term.</li>\n<li>Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it&#39;s monopoly in the iGaming space. Their biggest competitors PayPal &amp; Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space. Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings, Roblox, Twitch, Caesar&#39;s entertainment and many more.</li>\n<li>When it comes to iGaming space, the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely. People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations.</li>\n<li>As per nasdaq.com, the company is expected to <strong>exceed $103 billion in transactions</strong> this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>52% through 2025.</strong></li>\n<li>The company’s products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square, however, they plan on expanding in the coming years.</li>\n<li>As per nasdaq.com, The U.S. online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.4% between last year and fiscal year 2025 and <strong><em>Paysafe</em></strong> has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U.S.</li>\n<li>The company has expanded partnership with <strong>Coinbase</strong> and the company’s payment solution is in about 27  sites and exchanges. As investing and trading activity grows in the near future, Paysafe is well positioned to benefit.</li>\n<li>If you look at the Q1, the fundamentals were quite strong, company reported revenue of $377.4 million, which was higher by 5% on a year-on-year basis. The company&#39;s adjusted EBITDA was $113.2 million, which implies an EBITDA margin of 30%.</li>\n<li>The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e-cash solutions segment, adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110% higher and reported $48.1 million. The company reported revenue growth of 63% ~ $112.9 million.</li>\n<li>As per nasdaq.com, the e-cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42.6% as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30%. With strong growth in the e-cash segment, it’s likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters. As a matter of fact, Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32% for FY2021</li>\n<li>Between FY2020 and FY2023, the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about ~10%. Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U.S online gambling sector.</li>\n<li>If there is a synergy, Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to grow. The company is currently sitting at $274 million in cash and $225 million in un-drawn credit facility.</li>\n<li>According to nasdaq.com, Paysafe reported operating cash flow of $48.7 million in Q1. This would imply an annualized OCF of $195 million. With likely EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years, the company is positioned for healthy cash flow growth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the future of iGaming and online transactions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is no brainer in this question. The iGaming space and etransactions will keep exceeding in the near future. Many countries currently use cash for transactions, but as technology advances, third world countries are expected to go cashless and follow digital payments. As per the article from Juniper Research Ltd, the digital world is projected to exceed $10 Trillion in 2025. This is an 83% increase from 2020. The research also found that contactless and e-commerce payments will increase to 50% of total wallet spend in 2025 from less than 36% in 2020. More than 34% of mobile handsets are also seen to use contactless payments in 2025, up from 11% in 2020. Even a 2 year old baby would know that Paysafe is expected to benefit from this growth.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Stock price during after the merger,</p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the graph below, the Paysafe stock rocketed right after the merger announcement and shot up to as high as 20$/piece. What happened next should not shock the world because most of the SPAC&#39;s fell off post merger. BUT what makes this SPAC unique is the fact that they&#39;ve been able to pull off revenues and profits and were able to provide better guidance for the future.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3mhhphihm9771.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf8bdfae532f25cde8d25d6d0451e619677c434\">https://preview.redd.it/3mhhphihm9771.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf8bdfae532f25cde8d25d6d0451e619677c434</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Now, let&#39;s talk about Financials of Q1</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jkld8lqhm9771.png?width=2192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7f2180d3bf36f1910b1c8444c294e0ec7326803\">https://preview.redd.it/jkld8lqhm9771.png?width=2192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7f2180d3bf36f1910b1c8444c294e0ec7326803</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $377.4 million, an increase of 5%, compared to $359.7 million in the prior year.
