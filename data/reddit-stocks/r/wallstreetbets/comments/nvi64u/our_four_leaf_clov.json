A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you, crayon eaters.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes 🦍. We collectively are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon-eating apes who are eager to eat some tasty bananas 🍌. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions 💬 in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The main topic and example today is $CLOV.</strong> You&#39;ve most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four-leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tenders (currency).</p>\n\n<p>$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They &#39;borrow&#39; the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here&#39;s the catch. If they &#39;borrow&#39; the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good. Now, what causes the short squeeze?</strong> Truth is many factors. WSB as a whole usually rally around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and in turn, causes the stock to go up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the perfect recipe?</strong> Well, because it&#39;s so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they&#39;ve bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four-leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will &#39;exercise&#39; their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the &#39;strike&#39; price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it too late to purchase $CLOV?</strong> No, it&#39;s not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those bananas back to us at a higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isn&#39;t as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually are a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll profit if you hold. What you&#39;re seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What will the price hit? When do I sell?</strong> Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem. The stonk market is a scary place. There is always a risk, but this risk, for now, is limited.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did I miss out? Should I buy it now?</strong> It&#39;s up to you, I&#39;m not s financial advisor. Personally, I&#39;m doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.</p>\n\n<p>To all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I&#39;m telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Apes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best of luck. 🍀 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. 👍</p>\n\n<p>AMA 🗣️</p>\n\n<p>Edit: On June 18th many options contracts expire. So expect tons of movement in the coming days in an upward trend. Expect price drops a day or two before June 18th as paper hands try and exit. Don&#39;t fret, it will go back up. 🎢 Also, NO SHORTS HAVE COVERED THEIR POSITIONS YET. This means this hasn&#39;t even begun yet. The next few days will be interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: To all the people saying I work at a hedge fund, I&#39;d like to apologize to you and just say that is the funniest thing I&#39;ve read all day. Didn&#39;t realize how many conspiracy theorists there were here! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
