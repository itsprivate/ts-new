I will already have puts and short positions opened.\n\nNow you may think \"but hey, you will pay more on your insurance premiums every time you crash!\"\n\nThat's where you're wrong, kiddo. True, I will pay more for my premiums, but the insurance will eventually run out of money, default, and have their share price drop, all the while I have puts and short positions open. For every penny I give them in a premium, I will get atleast 2 pennies on my short position.\n\nBonus trade: Go long on Autoparts manufacturers as their demand will skyrocket.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",
