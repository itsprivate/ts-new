So buy in as much as you can now.\nQ: Should I buy BBBY options?\nA: Do not buy options, as every option bought reduces the price of BBBY per share by ~.0013%. So by purchasing options, you are not only hurting your own chances of profitability, but the entire WSB community’s. Stick to purchasing shares.\nQ: How much should I invest?\nA: Many WSB trolls would answer this with an answer similar to “everything you’ve got.” When investing in “meme stocks” like BBBY, you need to understand that it should not be viewed as a regular investment. Instead, treat it as a guaranteed money printer. Invest more than you can afford to lose, because you will not lose it. You will at the very least 10x your money.\n\nHope this helps!
