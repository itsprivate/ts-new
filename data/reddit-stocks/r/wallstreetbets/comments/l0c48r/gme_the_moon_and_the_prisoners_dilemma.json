Cum together and make a vow to 💎🙌 $GME for maximum 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>First a disclaimer. This post is written not as financial advice but for educational and entertainment purposes only.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been waiting patiently for the markets to open up(insert Pablo meme), and to my great surprise, found that both the Europoors and Mexican $GME lunar programs made great strides. I was so inspired by the international $GME activity,  I thought I would double check our upcoming launch operations and ensure that this mission doesn&#39;t face any Challenger-esque issues as we prepare to hit escape velocity. Strap the fuck in retards, I&#39;m going to show how your behavior this very week is going to determine how the rest of the MOASS plays out.</p>\n\n<p>Members of <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a> have had to explain to you, as a teacher does to a toddler, to ball up your goddamn fists, so you don&#39;t  📝👐 the $GME shares that Gabe Plotkin and the rest of his cuck associates at Melvin Capital desperately need to stave off financial ruin. For the devout and 💎🙌 autist, this is accepted canon, but I can sense through my overpriced Bloomberg terminal and the lack of 🚀 in some posts and comments.  There exists a meaningful cohort of uncommitted retards, for whom only a scientific explanation will make them believe.</p>\n\n<p>Enter - The Prisoner&#39;s dilemma. The Prisoner&#39;s dilemma is a hypothetical scenario, where two rational actors don&#39;t cooperate and by acting in their self-interest, don&#39;t produce the most ideal outcome. The classic example put forth by economists and mathematicians is when two bank robbers, placed in solitary confinement and sans communication with each other, are faced with a decision.  The prosecutor lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the main charge, but they have enough to convict both to lesser offenses. In this example, the prosecutors negotiate with the prisoner and make an offer. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by confessing that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with each other by remaining silent.</p>\n\n<p>Outcome #1) When one prisoner confesses and the other remains silent, the confessor goes free and his accomplice receives 20 years behind bars.</p>\n\n<p>Outcome #2) Both prisoners confess, they both receive 5 years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outcome #3 and the ideal outcome) Both prisoners remain silent and only receive 1 year each.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h5t19j8m57c61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e91ef2db00068e95dd2e23a4d8f2a25a7eca6d27\">Fig 1. for illiterate retards</a></p>\n\n<p>The most ideal outcome is through cooperation with both prisoners serving only 1 year, but academics in various fields, such as John Mearsheimer, the father of neorealism in international politics, would state that blah blah blah shut the fuck up, you know exactly where I&#39;m going with this shit.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the VW short squeeze, there were only a handful of shareholders that controlled the float, where engineering a short squeeze was all but certain.  In our case, the number of shareholders is significantly higher to include our lord and savior Ryan Cohen, boomer institutions(Scion, Hestia, Vanguard, etc) and the million strong soldiers of <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a>. While one can be critical of my explanation stating that this is in fact a N-person prisoner&#39;s dilemma, because they&#39;re a  <strong>🌈🐻</strong> with a PhD in the social sciences, or argue that <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a> is a community of rational actors, I would like to offer some counter-arguments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First</strong>, the soldiers of <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a> are not rational. See General <a href=\"/u/deepfuckingvalue\">u/deepfuckingvalue</a>, loaded to the tits with 💎🙌 that were forged through immense pressure and heat**. Read my lips - IRRATIONAL**</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second,</strong> there are instances in life where people don&#39;t act in their self-interest/self-preservation and cooperate. See marriages(successful ones you dipshit) and war(Battle of  Thermopylae).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Third,</strong> we have already seen how cooperation seems to have succeeded in the most recent skirmishes against the shorts. Boomer brokerages like schwab and fidelity are cockteasing some of you with increased interest rates to loan your shares to the likes of Melvin Capital.</p>\n\n<p>So in the same spirit of a marriage or war, we must make a sacred vow to hold our shares, for if we do not cooperate by  📝👐, we may as well have bought gourds. A mixture of 💎🙌 and 📝👐, and we go back to the floor of $17 set by the godfather Ryan Cohen. The only outcome that I or anyone on this sub should accept is where all soldiers💎🙌 to send this 🚀 around the moon to use the lunar orbit and slingshot $GME to the furthest reaches of the galaxy. My model says this price is $420.69. Only at this point, does it make sense for the GameStop leadership to issues the shares and acquire the capital needed for the long haul.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dhtgik3fe7c61.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15336b2a10ca00569efbce71704edd9cecebdf3c\">Fig 2. for illiterate retards</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s time to make history, a tale that will be told by your progeny on this Earth and the stars when our $GME starship 🚀. They will honor the legacy and future that you helped create, so now is the time to take this vow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I, [state your name], solemnly swear to hold my $GME shares from this day forward, for green days, for red days, for volatile swings, against the 🌈🐻, according to Ryan Cohen&#39;s board leadership, in the presence of</strong> <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a> <strong>I make this vow.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Position: 6000+ shares in $GME 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
