This is the FIRST VERSION of the post, but there could be more edits. I wanted to do a more extensive DD but as my exams start tomorrow I don’t have more time. If you want to take my work and extend it, please feel free to do so, just give a little shout out.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>FIRST AND FOREMOST, SHOUTOUT TO 🚀💎🙌 GME GANG 💎🙌 🚀, YOU’RE IN MY ❤️.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This DD is just my own analysis. I put my money where my mouth is but this is definitely not advice. Do your own DD.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Last thing</strong>:  Some stuff might be unsourced in this post but everything is sourced in the pdf version. While it’s not impossible that I might have missed some stuff, most of the time I put the stuff that I quote from other sources in italics. My ego is not big enough to feel like reformulating other people’s ideas and even less to steal other people&#39;s ideas. All I do is just gather insightful facts, figures, ideas and analysis.</p>\n\n<h1>Big picture</h1>\n\n<h2>1.1 Macroeconomic View</h2>\n\n<p>I will be brief here, I think everyone knows what’s up basically.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/iqtnlebs96961.png?width=682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=056c4261f530831621fb22bf4f4bf199e5e21f6a\">Figure 1: although the USD is worth a lot less, the S&amp;P 500 is doing alright. Thanks Jerome.</a></p>\n\n<p>Enthusiasm is the key word here as we are in an environment with a very accommodative monetary and fiscal policy (thanks for the stimulus checks). Equities and Bitcoin hit record highs thanks to positive vaccine news and the markets hope for a fiscal package. The Federal Reserve is going heavy on asset purchases, bailouts and loans. And its balance sheet is expanding as well as money supply. Interest rates are extremely low.</p>\n\n<p>Check for example, the <a href=\"https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe\">Shiller PE ratio</a> to see the enthusiasm driving the markets.</p>\n\n<p>On a macro-level side from the risks related to the pandemic, the only worrying signs would be the shrinking money velocity or a suddenly-rising inflation (hyperinflation is bullish for stocks but not for the real economy)</p>\n\n<p>That being said, we know how the FED and the government reacted to support the economy and the markets. Low interest rates and weak US dollar which is continuing to depreciate is very bullish for stocks overall.</p>\n\n<p>I keep the macroeconomic view very short for that GME correlation with the S&amp;P 500 is low - about 28% over the last 6 months. Moreover despite GME’s heavy reliance on brick-and-mortar stores, GME continues to get closer to profitability even with the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>If the pandemic would make the stock market to crash again during the trade, I wouldn&#39;t sell at a loss but wait a few days and then buy a LEAPS. This is my plan. Don&#39;t follow it, just make sure you have a plan in case it happens, it&#39;s important to avoid buying too much the first dip (because you might get a better price later) or worse, avoid a panic-selling and take a loss instead of tendies.</p>\n\n<h2>1.2 Sector(s) View</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zcaacwtnd6961.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e1ff470e54a8f9821f188793f7bbd2bee5d0986\">Figure 4: Video game market value worldwide from 2012 to 2023 (in billion USD)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/51jh22amd6961.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10993f493748a17354b3fb4e83dd7781da73c0f7\">Figure 5:  Retail ecommerce sales in the United States from 2017 to 2024 (in million USD)</a></p>\n\n<p>Video game total adressable market and ecommerce total adressable market keep growing, that&#39;s all we need to know on a macro-level.

And how much they sold in bundles (at high margins)?</p>\n\n<p>Although it’s still unclear from what I’ve found it’s pretty bullish:</p>\n\n<p><em>GameStop Corp. employees across the country were caught by surprise on Saturday when the video-game chain suddenly announced new shipments of the highly coveted PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles</em> - <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox\">bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/gaming/xbox-series-x-restock-walmart-target-gamestop-january-2021\">inverse.com/gaming/xbox-series-x-restock-walmart-target-gamestop-january-2021</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h8lt7bwhd6961.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e29536613629d3d86bce03bc9e4a89a4e983c337\">https://preview.redd.it/h8lt7bwhd6961.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e29536613629d3d86bce03bc9e4a89a4e983c337</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Figure 6</strong> : <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gamestop\">https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gamestop</a></p>\n\n<p>The recent <strong>Microsoft deal</strong> is extremely bullish for GameStop and could help the company to reach profitability sooner than expected. Here are the details about how it could impact GameStop’s profitability:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved.

It is also a fact that underperforming stores drain cash, which lowers net income and thus lowers earnings per share. Any store that is LOSING MONEY or is barely breaking even is keeping the stock price down because it&#39;s preventing future growth and killing net incomes. Closing underperforming stores will lead to a higher EPS and more cash that can be allocated to growth.</em> - horny131313.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><em>Gamestop is rebranding, and shifting to becoming the one stop video game and video game related product online retailer. While we haven&#39;t seen exactly what this will be, it is bullish to see them pivoting into other products besides just video games. Headsets, TVS, PC parts, you name it. You&#39;ve seen the omnichannel memes, but we know that If they are bullshitting, Cohen will step in.

Don’t get me wrong, this DOESN’T mean that it can’t happen, the % of shares shorted is still crazy high.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Days to cover</strong>: <em>It gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, short sellers must buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Understandably, they will seek to purchase the shares back for the lowest price possible, and this urgency to get out of their positions could translate into sharp moves higher. The longer the buyback process takes, as referenced by the &#39;days to cover&#39; metric, the longer the price rally may continue based solely on the need of short sellers to close their positions. Additionally, a high &#39;days to cover&#39; ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company&#39;s shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.</em> (Investopedia).</p>\n\n<p><strong>In terms of corporate actions</strong>, here is a quote from September mentioning the hostile takeover from Ryan which would trigger a massive short-squeeze, here is the explanation:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Short Squeeze Potential -</em></strong> <em>If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero. It will be exciting to see how it all plays out as according to Bloomberg/WSJ there are now 58 million shares short as of 8/31/2020 with only 65 million shares outstanding.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>If I were short, I&#39;d be sweating bullets right now. This won&#39;t end well and will ruin many</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Justin Dopierala is President and Founder of DOMO Capital.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to know when the potential short-squeeze could happen?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Massive volume in short dated calls. [...] If you have shares, DO NOT SELL COVERED CALLS FROM THEM. by doing this you make the likelihood of a squeeze decrease.</em> - horny131313</li>\n<li>U<em>nwind their short position with some behind closed doors deal. A scenario like this could include: Melvin offering shares of other stocks at discounted prices in exchange for GME shares or to unload a portion of their short shares. The second party to this deal could also offer to buy GME shares for higher than market prices</em> - horny131313</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you want to do a further analysis on short-metrics I put some additional figures - you might find some kind of pattern idk.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aghjvh78d6961.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee9e5aad122b1a1c7f63dbcc1820a32ea19ce0bf\">Figure 7: Stare statistics of November 2020</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ijbl9ay4d6961.png?width=438&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd9d0e786520d092df26cc80effa0dbe147cde2f\">Figure 8: Share statistics of December 2020</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7sp7ni43d6961.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42ac1cdfbfdc4e0dbe6b3b256893e885e876c74c\">Figure 9: Available shares to short vs. fees in &#37;.</a></p>\n\n<h2>2.4 Is GME Manipulated?</h2>\n\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xyzx8bl1d6961.png?width=717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efcf0647ba66214ff5fbb75f177f65d3cdb053d3\">I know there is actually a prob. with the &#37; daily returns (it isn&#39;t equal to 100&#37; BUT the proportions still hold true on a non 100 point basis). The main point is that: negative daily returns were much higher than positive ones.</a></p>\n\n<p>If you are familiar with the stock market, you might have noticed that winners do not act like this usually: total return was +21% yet there has been 53.3% red days. If you look at regular stocks which have positive cumulative returns it doesn’t happen that often (outliers aside).</p>\n\n<p>This is why I suspect that the stock is being manipulated but the weird stats might be explained just because the stock kept being shorted although it was not enough to keep the price down.</p>\n\n<p>Another opinion on this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Melvin and BoA both have short positions, and are desperately trying to drive the price down. Unfortunately, it is getting harder and harder to convince people that gamestop is a failing business. They are sweating and will continue to sweat. Given the buy side volume, they could close these short positions gradually without triggering a massive squeeze, however it WILL drive the price up significantly higher than it is now.</em> - horny131313.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>2.5 What 2020 Has Taught Us?</h2>\n\n<p>I think at this point it is the wrong question to ask (<em>is the stock being manipulated?</em>). To me, the most important thing is what is the upside potential and the risks associated? Then, how to trade GME?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>If you&#39;re new to gamestop, the volatility will seem scary but the shorts fight hard with this one. -10% days followed by +20% days are not unusual.</em> - horny131313</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would like to elaborate on this very idea.

For the real diamond hands you had +147% returns the next 2 months.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Psychologically this was a hard trade for sure. But for those who had diamond hands, it was pretty amazing. If you don’t feel comfortable being at -20% or even -30% returns for months before the stock literally BLOWS UP… Reduce your position and diamond hand with a smaller size.

Debt considered investment grade and not junk is a big positive and one most overlook.</em> - Stonksflyingup</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Short sellers close a part of their position huge short position.</li>\n<li>A major hedge fund takes a significant position on GME.</li>\n<li>Dividend reintroduction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>3.2 Downside Risks</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New short sellers open a position and current ones scale up theirs.</li>\n<li>Momentum towards profitability dies out and the company goes bankrupt.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Honestly if you read this far you know this is extremely unlikely.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Share dilution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>3.3 Overview</h2>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e46jey6nc6961.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bdfbdaf27d5caaf93fea0973ff3f114ab875eee\">Table 6: Upside risks</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/085l0xbic6961.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97f4fedef4b899b1ad49ed0dceb47144644b85ca\">Table 7: Downside risks</a></p>\n\n<h2>3.4 Commentary</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ag3sc9q9c6961.png?width=1023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d55ae8902ba4f3cd3dd4120f698c077b75633ce\">Figure 12: GME is one of or even THE most shorted stock for its valuation (in terms of &#37; short interest).</a></p>\n\n<p>This means two things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is very unlikely for the shorts to continue to short the company especially when its credit rating is being upgraded - we will see if it keeps getting upgraded or not in March.</li>\n<li>If the shorts get to short it more (or new short sellers open a position) it will:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Drive the stock price down (lower market cap), drive the short ratio higher making the unwinding of the short sellers even harder and as a result making the probability to have a short-squeeze VERY BIG if good events happen moving forward.</li>\n<li>Push Ryan Cohen to accelerate its plans.\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>I will personally increase my share-position if it happens.</em></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<h2>4.1 Prices Targets</h2>\n\n<p>Here is a summary of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kow6gs/gme_price_targets_for_2021_according_to_the_short/\">my post</a>:</p>\n\n<p>When the short % of free float went from a high point (~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (~140%) - which by the way are in absolute terms both huge numbers- the stock went up ~94% <strong>BUT</strong> most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that 💎🙌-ing is key to capture most of the gains.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5ysyfz35c6961.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541ade007b74cb376a2477c6705c87999c51cdb5\">Figure 13: GME returns from 3 Feb. 2020 to 1 Sept. 2020</a></p>\n\n<p>Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock you could “feel” like you bled when you watch the stats:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Positive daily returns</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Negative daily returns</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">49.3 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">50.7 %</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>But IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Best daily return</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Worst daily return</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">23.0 %</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-13.7 %</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns.
