Weve arrived at the BDE moment..</p>\n\n<p><strong>SHORTS HAVE TO PAY THE DIVIDEND</strong></p>\n\n<p>Shorts have to pay $1.11 for every share they are short on 3/9</p>\n\n<p>BUYBACK PROGRAM</p>\n\n<p>What else was in that juicy investor conference? Wait for it…</p>\n\n<p><strong>$1 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK PROGRAM</strong></p>\n\n<p>See, RKT makes so much fucking money they can afford not only a special divi, but a $1B share buyback. Im telling you this man is going into the trenches and clearing the shorts out by his fucking self.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>$RKT has been suppressed for way too fuckin long, the company owns 95% of the shares and Jay Farner/Dan Gilbert hate shorts and they have diamond fuckin nuts, they aint sellin. Shorts have to cover their 43mm shares or they are <strong>forced to pay $1.11/share they are short on 3/9</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you can’t do math. If u buy shares and hold thru 3/9.. it’s an instant 5% return via the special dividend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
