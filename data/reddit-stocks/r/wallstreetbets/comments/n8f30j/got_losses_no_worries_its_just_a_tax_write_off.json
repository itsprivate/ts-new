Capital Gains tax can be something you are worried about. But you also have Capital Loss Dedications. If you are married and filing jointly or Single (like most retail investors are), you can claim 3k deduction. For married but filing separately folks, it&#39;s 1.5k. Best part about the system, losses carry over till the amount is fully used as a deduction (15k loss in a year translates to 5 years worth of 3k deductions). </p>\n\n<p>Example. If I lost 15k on my plays before the end of the taxable year (December 31st 2020) and I&#39;m married filing jointly. I can get a 3k deduction from my taxable income or capital gains for my 2020 taxes. This then drops my capital loss down ammount to 12k. Next year for my 2021 taxes, I can use another 3k deduction from the 2020 losses to drop my taxable income. This again drops my capital loss from 2020 to 9k. You can continue to do this till that capital loss amount hits zero. </p>\n\n<p>Key point, no matter how much you gained in a year in trading, it doesn&#39;t just make your capital losses just disappear. Even if I gained in 2021, I can still use the 2020 capital losses to offset all taxable income sources. So make sure you claim those losses WSB. You didn&#39;t lose trading, you simply made it so your taxable income is offset in the years to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just to clarify. It has to a be a total lose at the end of the tax year. This means that after gains and losses. You have to lose money. This can only be calculated on closed out positions. Holding assets if they depreciate in value, doesn&#39;t mean it is considered a loss. &quot;It&#39;s only a loss if you sell&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Someone brought up Gains. If I lost money one year but gained money the next. My 3k deduction gets applied to the Capital Gains tax first. If I lost 15k in 2019 but made 15k in 2020. My 2020 gains will be taxed as making 12k. Now if I  made only 2k in 2020. I don&#39;t pay taxes on that 2k and that 1k left over goes to my taxable income. Consecutive year losses doesn&#39;t just make it compound either. It just make a different deduction pot later down the road.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: Something I forgot to mention but another poster did. Losses on wash sales don&#39;t apply. Look up Wash Sales if you don&#39;t know what it is.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: I attempted to make it clear but failed to do so. The Capital Loss is a deduction, not a credit. This means that it isn&#39;t exactly a 1-1 solution. What I was trying to convey is that a Capital Loss can lower your taxable income. This doesn&#39;t means that you will get 3k back in  a return but that you taxable income is reduced by 3k. So if you are in the upper limit of a tax bracket, that 3k offset to taxable income may mean little. But if you are in the lower end of a tax bracket, that 3k may be able to put you down another bracket so you can qualify for other deductions or credits.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 5: removed realized to avoid confusion with Tax Credits.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
