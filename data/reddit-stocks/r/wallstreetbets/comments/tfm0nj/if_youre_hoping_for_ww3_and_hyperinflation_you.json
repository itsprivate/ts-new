Time for some karma you rainbow bellied bitch.\n\nI'll never judge a someone for hedging their portfolio, but actively hoping for death, destruction and widespread bankruptcy is another thing entirely.\n\nIt's not very nice to want to see the world burn, so that you can make some money.\n\nThe next few weeks will tell that just like every other time we thought the end was here - the world is not actually going to cave in on itself.\n\nI will bet you all my money (and I have) that the bottom was Monday.\n\nReasons why Monday was peak fear:\n\n* The world is beginning to relax a bit as we understand that USA and Russia are not going to nuke each other\n* Europe will not lose access to it's energy\n* Fertilizers will not be sanctioned, and the crisis will not trigger a global famine\n* Despite what the headlines say, Russia was not cut off entirely from SWIFT. Only some banks were.\n* Both sides want some form of peace\n* Just by looking at the inflationary data from 2021, you can see that we are about to hit an inflection point in inflation growth.
