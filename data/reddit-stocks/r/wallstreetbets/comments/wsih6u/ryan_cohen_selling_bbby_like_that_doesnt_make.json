It makes no sense he would sell his position for a $68M profit.\n\nThey said RC and BBBY reached an agreement yesterday, we don’t know what that is yet but it will be announced before the end of Aug.\n\nRC has had a strong relationship with Apes for a long time now. $68M also not worth trashing your rep and image and ego and fan club for. It's not even a profit, it's a hundred million loss with the GME impact taken into account (which he is well aware of). Throw in his entire brand, and obsessive personal identity towards the little guy, and there's no way he would do this without something guaranteed to counterbalance and knock it out of the park.\n\nSelling his stake was likely part of that agreement. Liquidity for BBBY was specifically mentioned and this fits, if they get his Insider Stake. What RC gets in return, we don’t know yet. We can speculate, Buy Buy Baby is the only asset of value that comes to mind.\n\nBig announcement incoming boys and girls, by the end of the month if not tomorrow AM.\n\nSomething way, way bigger than a little profit on stock trade. Think Bigger!\n\nI choose to trust RC for now.\n\nPosition: 614 at $4.78, haven't sold anything.\n\nStop being little bitches. Most of you bought because of a short squeeze anyway, not RC. And the squeeze is still in play.\n\n**Edit**: not $19M but $68M as some of you have pointed out. My opinion stands. He had multiple opportunities to sell for more than that in the past 5 months and he didn't.\n\nAs for calling some of you little bitches, yes you are. And stop playing risky stocks with money you can't afford to lose.",
