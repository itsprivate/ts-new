Earnings coming up, potential CEO announcement, too many catalysts to speak of. Taking part of my gme gains from squeeze 1 and putting it back in. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/543ztb9xbhm61.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a605e4fcf2d7bdc4442751a3918fb27c19ca0641\">https://preview.redd.it/543ztb9xbhm61.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a605e4fcf2d7bdc4442751a3918fb27c19ca0641</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>\nI don&#39;t have time for an EndGame part 7 dd. However I believe there are a number of catalysts leading up to earnings. </p>\n\n<p>1) Cohen as ceo \nSherman&#39;s been ceo for exactly 2 years now. Since Cohen has joined the board other Chewy folks have been hired into senior roles. Cohen is in charge of a committee that is hiring the next CFO and is responsible for capital allocation. Sherman is not on that committee. Sherman tanked the last earnings call and stock price while cohen rescued it by buying a meme level of shares. </p>\n\n<p>Cohen has made Sherman so much money (sherman has 2m shares that he can&#39;t sell easily as an insider). It&#39;s in sherman&#39;s best interests to get out and get liquid on what could be a billion dollar nest egg.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 Sherman was announced as CEO 5 days BEFORE earnings. </p>\n\n<p>2) Debt \nGMEs 2021 bond matures in 4 days. Potential credit rating impact. </p>\n\n<p>3) Potential 3/19 DTCC changes forcing brokers to force close short positions or at least shore up capital (could negatively impact longs as well, unsure here though)</p>\n\n<p>4) IV will likely spike in calls just before earnings</p>\n\n<p>5) cohen&#39;s tweeting </p>\n\n<p>All of this, while a squeeze is actively happening was enough to yolo some shares after hours and some calls tomorrow if we see a dip.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
