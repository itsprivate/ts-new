On Friday Feb 5th, after market close, I decided I was just gonna call it a loss and close my position in GME the following Monday at market open. That Saturday, I drove 4 hours home and surprised my mom at my aunts house.</p>\n\n<p>My aunt put together a birthday dinner for my mom and I thought it would be a nice surprise for her to see her son on her b-day. It was a fun party. We ate, drank, and played games into the evening. At one point though, my aunt remembered something.</p>\n\n<p>She and her spouse moved her old ass couch out of her home to the dump the previous week. In the process of moving however, she found a wallet inside.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bpoihfh7fol61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95e6300998685c2deac982bd32fa2107d0b664f\">https://preview.redd.it/bpoihfh7fol61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95e6300998685c2deac982bd32fa2107d0b664f</a></p>\n\n<p>The wallet was my first wallet ever. It still had my 7th grade student ID card, locker combination, and class schedule inside. What really made my testies tingle though was the Gamestop Value card that was inside.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9wl2va36fol61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16fe66b39e8491e7ac8cbe63976c5257158c487a\">https://preview.redd.it/9wl2va36fol61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16fe66b39e8491e7ac8cbe63976c5257158c487a</a></p>\n\n<p>Of all the times over the last 15 years that this wallet could have been found, it remained hidden until the very time I needed it most. If this wasn&#39;t a sign from God or w/e you do or don&#39;t believe in, I don&#39;t know what is.</p>\n\n<p>After coming across this card my paperhands solidified into solid fucking diamonds. I watched the price like a hawk and bought the dip. I&#39;m in 20 shares at ~$190 now and I&#39;M NOT FUCKIN LEAVIN.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
