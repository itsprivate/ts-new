Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven&#39;t won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won&#39;t see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it&#39;s still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk. It sounds cliche, but this literally is the turning point. This is where we make history.</p>\n\n<p>tldr; hold, buy more, whatever. Don&#39;t fall for their shit. GME 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
