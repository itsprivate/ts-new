I was very confused about this. Why would she have a boyfriend? We are married after all?\n\nBut because I have so much faith in this community, I decided to ask my wife about it. It took me all the courage I had build up from the past 10 years. But I did it. Her response may not surprise many of you. \"Ofcourse I have a boyfriend\", she said. \"You really think I just don't have sex? Like at all?\". Obviously this shocked me. I've been a virgin my whole life. How uncommon is this? I was very confused.\n\nSo obviously first thing I asked was what this guy's name was. \"Dan\", she said. \"Dan?\", I said. \"Are you kidding me? Both our kids are called Dan. Next thing you're going to tell me is I'm not the father of our kids?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We've never had sex\", she said. \"Ofcourse you're not\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell that just blew my mind guys. I'm still overwhelmed. Don't really know what to think anymore. It does however explain why she didn't like the name PLTR. I'm a little down but not to be worried cause atleast I have you guys.\n\nI guess the next step would be to actually ask \"Dan\" for permission. Any tips on how to do that? I really want him to say yes. My schlong has been in the dark since the beginning of times, and it needs to see what's beyond the shorts.",
