A lot of the posts and comments as of late (especially if you sort by new), are absolutely cringeworthy.  Facepalm after facepalm that make me want to sit the person down and say, &quot;sweety, you are going to get absolutely creamed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Lots of people stating the obvious and thinking it is something downright genius.  Lots of &quot;investing my life savings,&quot; &quot;I only have 2K to my name what do I do with it,&quot; &quot;Just starting out how do options work?&quot;.  No understanding of company valuation, overall market sentiment, and probably most not even understanding what a share of stock represents...</p>\n\n<p>Case and point:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tiktokinvestors/status/1350854473598558213?s=10\">https://twitter.com/tiktokinvestors/status/1350854473598558213?s=10</a></p>\n\n<p>While we are all extremely excited that a lot of people are making money these days, and right now you can almost throw a dart at a dartboard and land on something that will  🚀, if you do not know what you are doing, you are playing a HIGH RISK GAME AND YOU WILL LOSE MONEY.  AND POTENTIALLY LOTS OF MONEY.  MAYBE ALL OF IT.  It&#39;s happened throughout history, over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>The folks that play this game and consistently make a ton of money at it are very good at what they do.  They have a lifetime of experience, understanding, and tools at their disposal that we do not have.  I am a finance major, a business owner, and over 15 years in basic investing, and I still get walloped from time to time.  I&#39;ve got nothing on those guys, or the brilliant minds on this thread.</p>\n\n<p>Please make sure you are messing around with money you can afford to lose.  Yes, I am in BB, GME, and a bunch of others, but I&#39;m playing around with money that won&#39;t hurt me if I lose.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the folks on here are putting up their rent money, college money, life savings, and grandma&#39;s disability check on BETS without understanding how much risk they are actually taking.  While we all want Melvin to suffer, look out for your fellow man.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with owning SOME index funds, and the ones I own are making money as well.</p>\n\n<p>Now that has been said,</p>\n\n<p>To the freaking moon.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀</p>\n\n<p>Upvote for your fellow newbie investor about to lose his shirt.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:  If you are in GME, this is not a post encouraging you to sell.  It is too late for your soul and you need to (insert diamond hands here...someone paste it I can&#39;t find it).  GME  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2:  WOW!  I did not expect this to get a lot of attention.  I&#39;m glad that a few people took note and for everyone else looking out, that&#39;s one of the reasons I like this sub!  I want to reiterate - if you understand the above, if you understand the roaring 20s and the Great Depression, and you accept the risks with your YOLO, that&#39;s fine!  This is for the ever growing crowd that thinks 10-15% gains is NORMAL, and that they can leverage themselves to the teeth to become the next DFV overnight.  These people clearly DO NOT understand the risks, and therefore deserve a quick heads up.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve received some messages asking where to start.  That&#39;s great.  Here&#39;s what I would suggest:</p>\n\n<p>Youtube and Google are your friends.  Anything you read that you don&#39;t understand (Calls, puts, shorts, float, squeeze - Google IT).  Start with WHAT A SHARE OF STOCK ACTUALLY REPRESENTS, and that you are paying a price for a small percentage of ownership in that company and its current (or potential/eventual) profits.  Start with BASIC company valuation - learn about market cap, PE ratios, P/S ratios.  Learn how to read an income statement and balance sheet.  Make sure companies have a path to profitability if they are not making money.  With this knowledge, you can start to understand for yourself if a company is potentially over or undervalued.  Start with what companies you know and understand what they are selling, along with trends that you know and understand. When you start getting into stuff that you don&#39;t understand or see the vision for, you&#39;re just along for the ride.  Trial by fire and just getting into it is fine (I learn constantly from my own mistakes and practice makes perfect), but make it a very small percent of what you have. Buy partial shares. Also, realize you will need to probably buy and hold many stocks...it won&#39;t just happen overnight. Recent MEME stocks are an exception. When that happens, awesome. But it&#39;s rarely like that.  GL and have fun with it too.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
