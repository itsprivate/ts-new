Its interface sucks, it looks like some shit that hedgies use to make themselves look so sophisticated; something my wife's boyfriend would use to impress her. So fucking complicated, just let us swipe left and right like we're looking for a quick $20 blowie behind the Wendy's. Why is it all black? I know my colors, I've eaten plenty of crayons, and I can tell you, I've never been in the black! Just give me a rainbow bear if the future is red and a rocket ship if it is green! Please help me guys, it costs almost as much as the capital losses I harvest every year! I need this to work, I can only live off selling clips of my wife getting railed by her boyfriend for so long!",
