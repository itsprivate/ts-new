There are professional manipulators that are not only pumping and dumping but love volatility. \n\n\nHalfway up in a squeeze they start bitching about diamond hands and you hear them say things like, \"But I got my profit,\" \"I like money\" (used to be called tendies by regarded apes where did that go?) \"You don't know what you talk about!\" \"The numbers show that ABCD company will bankrupt!.\"\n\n\nNo, these are not Gaybears. These are people who are starting to bet heavier on puts. They hope you will start selling at some point. It doesn't matter if it's soon but who doesn't love a 40% drop in a squeezing stock when you have daily or weekly puts. \n\n\nI'm not gonna start saying, \"trust me bruh.\" I joke about it a lot and say, \"Trust me bruh\" in some humor posts but this isn't a \"Trust me, Bruh\" post, Trust me, Bruh!\n\n\nYou can do your due diligence very easily these days. You don't have to pay for data either like used to for every single thing. Apes are more sharing than ever. \n\n\nBy using a few sources, I will prove it to you. Let's look at BBBY in the last few months. \n\n\n[Here is the Volume for BBBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?p=BBBY)\n\n\n[Here is yearly, weekly, and other general stats for BBBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/key-statistics?p=BBBY)\n\n\n[Here is the data for Borrowed shares and borrowing cost for BBBY](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/borrowed_shares/?quote=BBBY)\n\n\n[Here is the FTD data until the end of July for BBBY](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/failure_to_deliver/?quote=BBBY)\n\n\n\nHow can you use this data to make some sense? Let's start asking some questions to find a correlation. (I can hear the quants laughing but that's fine. his is for the general apes who have paperhanded in the last two days.)\n\n\nWhen did BBBY start going up from the bottom on a high volume day? \n\n\nOn August 5th, Friday. Open **$6.66**  Close **$8.16** Volume: **52,577,300**\n\n\n\nIs there a huge number of FTDs from July 1st (+35 date is Ausgust 5th)? Nope. Is there a big FTD settlement date coming up? Yes. So the pump started with the pump here. The volume that day was over half a billion. Do you really think this was a WSB pump? I'll leave it up to you.\n\n\n\nWhat happened on Monday? BBBY opened at $10.92! Despite over 122 Million share volume that day and in total 365 MILLION volume that week BBBY traded sideways until Friday August 12. Now this is a stock that has a float of less than 70 Million. All the hype and talk about pump and dump that week, we had no real movement until the day FTDs from July started hitting. July 8 FTDs: 777,475 shares at $5.44. Closing Price on August 12 was $12.95. That's over 1% of the float but it's getting spicier. This week Monday there were 3,152,293 FTDs from July 11. That's about 5% of the float. [Now look at the shares available to borrow and borrow rates again starting August 12.](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/borrowed_shares/?quote=BBBY)\n\nOn Tueday, the same thing kept happenning with nearly 1.2 Million FTDs from July 12th. Now do you understand why BBBY opened at $26 on Wednesday and peaked at $30. Ryan is a smart guy. He sold his shares on days where float was traded 3-5 times and when FTDS had to deliver. Did we have a small short squeeze. Yes. But is it over? No.\n\n\nFunny you ask why. On Wednesday BBBY was added to [Regsho.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp#:~:text=A%20threshold%20list%2C%20also%20known%20as%20a%20Regulation,set%20by%20the%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission%20%28SEC%29.) \n\n\n[Here is the list](http://nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=RegSHOThreshold)\n\n\nThis isn't nearly over. It's just begun. Those FTDs from July was from when the stock was 4-5 dollars. You think they closed? They have only shorted more so that they could profit from paperhanded bitches selling. \n\n\nNow on Monday, it's up to you to decided what to do. \n\n\nAs I mentioend in the beginning, this isn't a trust me bruh post. Everything is laid out for you, hence no TA:DR at the end. Just fucking read, it's the weekend. \n\n\nHave a great fucking weekend.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: This got some traction so time to edit. [Here is where I think we are.](https://steemitimages.com/p/26uUsAjKTsXCBRzTxRJWxpz7qLMdK4Nq6Ha3QAmrmWNLCRew1SDj7JkEoojF6Xsue9cx8dfgMrubcv22vLJexFjJKWYVr46C6dMSrGczCZha5Bp8dwHoN7wfcmChUua6vBBG9QB4E4mLBtnTQ7NhvRNULBqPU35TgkVcM4?format=match&amp;mode=fit&amp;width=1280) The dip before the rip. \n\nThis is the VW squeeze. If you don't know, google it. It takes 2 seconds. I'll let you find out what may happen if you actually understand how shorts may have been caught with their pants down... once again. That's why my thesis is based on FTDs and regsho. I'm not talking about the fundamentals of the company being so great. I believe it's got enough lifeline to keep it going for another quarter. There is an opportunity if they do end up selling Buy Buy Baby. [If you listen to their AGM, just last month, they are considering different options. So it is possible that they may sell it.](https://central.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/vsm/web?pvskey=BBBY2022)\n\n\nI think with the price action and volume from this past week, it is possible that shorts have shorted some more, but at what cost? Cost to borrow was at or above 30% for most of the high volume days. They may have covered some in the last two days, thanks to FUD and paper handed bitches. \n\n\nThe next earnings report is at the end of September. I don't know why a company would just decide to file chapter 11 before that and in the same month they hire a company to deal with restructuring. I haven't seen any consulting company work that quickly. Also, I haven't read anywhere that they have missed an interest payment, [which is around 65Million dollars this year according to this income statement.](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBBY/financials/annual/income-statement) When they actually start missing interest payments, and  can't deal with their short-term liabilities anymore, and if back to college doesn't help with their cash flow this month, then yes.
