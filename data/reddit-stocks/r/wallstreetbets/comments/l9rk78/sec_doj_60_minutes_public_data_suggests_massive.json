Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than <strong>102,000,000</strong> shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.</p>\n\n<p>On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  </p>\n\n<p>Once you include call options, <strong>retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)</strong>. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long Version:</strong>\nA more detailed analysis by <a href=\"/u/johnnydaggers\">/u/johnnydaggers</a> is here.
