Also I&#39;m extremely bored being the weekend and all.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAlso, this is the first essay that I&#39;ve written since my master&#39;s thesis.\nI know you can&#39;t read for shit but I just have to get this off my chest and hopefully save you some money.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTo the new influx of people here - <strong>THIS ABSOLUTELY CONCERNS YOU TOO!!!</strong> There will be no <strong>TL;DR</strong> nor a <strong>TL;CR</strong>. If you can&#39;t read or don&#39;t want to read, here&#39;s a 🚀. Go fuck yourself.</p>\n\n<h1>I. What happens now with GME?</h1>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all some background on me and then we&#39;ll get to the good stuff: Software engineer at a very big company, ex-CTO in 2 failed startups.\nOne of the startups failed miserably and the other obtained 500k in VC funding and then failed miserably.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t believe in short squeezes as an investing framework. Short squeezes are price actions where one side gets the stick and the other gets the carrot. The problem is that, more likely than not, the side that gets the stick is also the side that&#39;s right.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shitron, in his shitty video, although he was wrong 90% of the way, he was right in one instance: There is a reason why short interest is high in a security - the business is failing or expected to fail.\nNow ask yourself this: do you want to put money on the line in the hopes of someone, although that someone is right, gets margin called, then his margin call triggers other margin calls, and you somehow sell at the top and not left hanging with heavy bags worth nothing? Fuck me that&#39;s retarded beyond any autism spectrum. \nIf you &#39;invest&#39; in short squeezes you deserve to lose it all or, if you orchestrated it, go to jail like that Martin Skreli guy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GME will get to high triple digits sooner or later thanks to the small amount of float, low total number of shares, and current low market cap - so this isn&#39;t done yet! \nThe increase is not because of a price action, it&#39;s because Cohen took over, he&#39;s serious about digital transformation, omnichannel, has cash and most importantly has a good management team backing him up.\nThe guys that are shorting need to get out, not because they will get margin called, but because they are wrong.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some pretty good DDs out there and won&#39;t go through them as you should start using google / reddit search to feed your confirmation bias. \nThe only DD that caught my eye is the VC funding one, which is why I told you my background:\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven&#39;t read it, go read it - it&#39;s good - it&#39;s also a painful trip down on memory lane from the time when I was talking to VCs, clients and investors. I firmly believe that the guy is right and this is a very possible future of GME.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other hand, GME as a business doesn&#39;t want to squeeze &amp; be known for a pump and dump. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why?</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Because they have a business to run and not some elaborate scam; </li>\n<li>GME wants to grow organically but cannot do so with this amount of short interest so they most likely will bail the shorts out at some point; </li>\n<li>Who here don&#39;t like <strong>free money</strong>?;</li>\n<li>Their bottom line matters. They want to have the capital to pay down high-interest rate debts and they also want to have money to start investing in growth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>When?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck me if I know. If I knew I&#39;d be a freaking billionaire not ranting on the internet.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there&#39;s a scenario where this doesn&#39;t squeeze at all and the price increases instantly, then GME issues shares, then from that point forward the growth story begins. Be ready for this scenario and temper your expectations accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up on GME there are 2 very possible scenarios that I see in the near future: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>GME will squeeze hard and reach high triple digits soon, go back down hard and then growth begins;</li>\n<li>GME will issue shares, bail out the shorts, pay down its debt and then have free-fuel to rocket into that 50B valuation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, be prepared to hold for a few years if the 2nd scenario comes to fruition or get back in after the squeeze and hold for a few years.</p>\n\n<h1>II. What happens after GME?</h1>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of you are going to have money available. <strong>A LOT OF MONEY</strong>, by your standards. A lot of you small fish, smooth brained, extra chromosomal, autistic retards are going to want <strong>MORE!!!</strong> \nThe truth is, you got lucky, this is one in a decade event, there is no next GME. Keep in mind that the best funds out there make 20% per year. In the long run, you will do worse!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that we should get out of the way: WSB is NOT a pump and dump sub-reddit where someone posts some DD and then everyone else puts money in. That&#39;s stupid, that&#39;s not how investing works, that&#39;s not what this sub is about. To top it all, we don&#39;t have the capital to have any meaningful impact on the market. But, but, but...shut up, nobody is going to pump some worthless piece of shit so you can get out.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a very good post on how to identify a pump and dump here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jdvfok/the_anatomy_of_a_wsb_pump_and_dump/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jdvfok/the_anatomy_of_a_wsb_pump_and_dump/</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read that motherfucker like it&#39;s your bible. Better yet, fuck the bible, fuck Jesus, fuck Buddha and fuck whatever else you fucks worship. That post needs to be printed on paper, laminated, by your bedside, indexed per line and when someone says [4:23] you&#39;d better know the word at that location.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My GME average is somewhere around $16 per share, quite high by some standards, but that&#39;s because I didn&#39;t believe in the original thesis, I didn&#39;t know when Cohen would get serious and quite frankly, from my perspective, before October, the conditions just weren&#39;t there for me to risk money on this. I spent 100 hours+ researching GME before I put a dollar in. I only put money in when I was knowledgeable enough to risk it. You fucks need to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WSB is a corner near the ghetto-supermarket where drug dealers, hookers, retards and currency traders meet up to share ideas. If you new retards don&#39;t believe me, search for a dude named Variation Separate (or something like that) and the red river of loss that followed. Some of the guys here will have had an episode of PTDS after reading that name, You fuckers need to understand that there are some shady people here, that will sound smart, be smart and are after <strong>YOUR HARD EARNED CASH</strong>. Even if they aren&#39;t after your money, they can still be dead wrong.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone will post a TA chart, filled with crayons, support lines, MACDs and all sorts of math equations and you retards will go all in thinking - this is the big one - here comes the money train - choo choo! Yeah the train is here, but you are on the tracks!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for new traders, old traders and everyone else here, when investing, I have the following pieces of advice for you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>do well at your job and earn risk-free money;</li>\n<li>stick to what you know - aka the business segment you&#39;re currently employed in. You will most likely beat <strong>MOST IF NOT ALL</strong> analysts, because you have more intimate day-to-day knowledge;</li>\n<li>if you decide to invest in something else than your current expertise, like gourds or GME, do the research, read 10Ks Qs, S1s, 13Fs, 13Ds, form 4s etc. READ READ READ and get it through your thick skull that nobody else here is going to do it for you;</li>\n<li>learn to spot bullshit!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Did you play GME?</h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, you are winning. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be humble, be smart with your money and most importantly, when this is done, take some god damn time off the market maybe even time off work and relax! I know I will. You will have deserved it.</p>\n\n<h3>You didn&#39;t play GME?</h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucks, but you have an opportunity to learn. Learn why the trade happened, learn the conditions that lead to this trade. This will happen again 10-20 years from now in another context, something will be different but you&#39;ll be able to spot it. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>III. The state of WSB after GME</h1>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-read the previous segment. I think Pumps and dumps and next GMEs will be rampant.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;ll also see 3 main categories joining:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Noobs. You new retards will do well here and lose a lot of money;</li>\n<li>Hedge fund chads. These guys will start reading through the shit here and try to find ways to fuck you, your wife and your wife&#39;s boyfriend. Get ready for pegging if you don&#39;t start reading; </li>\n<li>Pump and dump scalping sharks. These guys will try to trick you into a pump and dump scheme on a company nobody ever heard of and take your money. It&#39;s your own god damn fault for pressing buy/sell so act accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not financial advice! Compulsory GME diamond rockets at the end.</p>\n\n<p>💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎🚀</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English is not my native language so if you are here to correct grammar, fuck you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
