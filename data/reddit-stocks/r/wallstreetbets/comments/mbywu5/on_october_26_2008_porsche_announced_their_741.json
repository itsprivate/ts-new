No dates; no predictions; don&#39;t rely on me to make financial decisions; just fucking facts:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are eerie similarities between the Volkswagen Squeeze and the GameStop situation.</p>\n\n<p>October, 26, 2008, Porsche announces their extremely high ownership of VW&#39;s free float:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Porsche has decided to make this announcement after it became clear that there are by far more short positions in the market than expected. <strong>The disclosure should give so called short sellers - meaning financial institutions which have betted or are still betting on a falling share price in Volkswagen - the opportunity to settle their relevant positions without rush and without facing major risks.</strong>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.porsche-se.com/en/news/press-releases/details/news/detail/News/porsche-heads-for-domination-agreement-1\">https://www.porsche-se.com/en/news/press-releases/details/news/detail/News/porsche-heads-for-domination-agreement-1</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Price on October 26, 2008 (Sunday, day of announcement): $28.745 --&gt; Two Days Later, October 28, 2008: VW Price, $116.150.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>[Now before you Apes go ape shit and say VW was in the $1000&#39;s (yes, it was) I&#39;m going off the new share prices because this is the only place where I can find accurate stock prices on Yahoo Finances dated back to 2008.]</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Come today</strong>. GameStop: $154.03.</p>\n\n<p>GameStop&#39;s 10-K disclosure:</p>\n\n<p>March 23, 2021, GameStop announces an undisclosed &quot;large proportion&quot; of their stock is shorted:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. <strong>To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.</strong> Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze.</strong> A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html\">https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html</a></p>\n\n<p>OK. You&#39;ve made it this far. Does history repeat itself? Yes, it can. Does history rhyme (as in, does it <em>seem</em> eerily similar.) Yes, it can.</p>\n\n<p>HERE&#39;S THE RUB [Hint: It&#39;s in the comparison of how they hinted at short sellers]:</p>\n\n<p>GME:</p>\n\n<p>To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, <strong>investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common</strong> Stock.</p>\n\n<p>VW:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The disclosure should give so called short sellers</strong> - meaning financial institutions which have betted or are still betting on a falling share price in Volkswagen - <strong>the opportunity to settle their relevant positions without rush and without facing major risks</strong>.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You Decide What Happens from Here.
