This used to be a sub full of different opinions, you could tell people that you think they&#39;ve drunk away what little brain cells they had left when they post stupid DD that isn&#39;t even DD. Now it&#39;s like <a href=\"/r/politics\">r/politics</a> , an endless circle jerk over how &quot;The hedge funds will bleed&quot;. I don&#39;t give a shit about your cause, I just want to make tendies and that&#39;s what this sub used to be all about. Now the only content is: GME, GME, Short, &quot;haha Elon twitter go woosh&quot;. Low-quality bullshit content barely worthy of <a href=\"/r/funny\">r/funny</a>. What happened to the likes of JNUG?</p>\n\n<p>Look, I know the game is rigged, we all fucking know that. But this is deranged and has strayed too far from what this sub used to be all about, those sweet tendies. I might sound like your wife&#39;s boyfriend when I tell you this, but we have to stop this pyramid scheme level of group thinking delusion.</p>\n\n<p>DD, good memes and both gain and loss porn are getting smothered in a sea of GME-truthing posts. I think I speak not just for myself but for many other long time members of the sub when i say this:</p>\n\n<p>We need to stop circlejerking over one stock and go back being retarded over many stocks/options/gourd futures etc. Have you even heard of JNUG?</p>\n\n<p>Therefore i propose a ban of all GME content that isn&#39;t proper DD or memes.</p>\n\n<p>TL:DR GME 1000C or 1P I don&#39;t care, I just want this subreddit back.  </p>\n\n<p>Also: Know what JNUG is or ban</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
