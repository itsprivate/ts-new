A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs!!\n\nI live in an apartment, I cannot take delivery of 50 tons of eggs!! What do I do???? I made a killing so I can hire whoever I need to to make this go away but can someone help me? I do not want 50 tons of eggs coming to my door.\n\nWould it be illegal for me to list delivery address as the nearest federal reserve building???\n\nFor reference/perspective: there are between approx 1174 and 2381 DOZEN eggs in a single ton. This puts me at approx 720,000 - 1.2 million eggs. I am really\nStressing out over the logistics of how the fuck I’d ship out this amount of eggs to shelters. It would have to be SO many shelters.\n\nEDIT: Those of your DMing me/commenting offering to buy my eggs, there is a 0% chance I’m doing business with anyone autistic enough to use this sub.
