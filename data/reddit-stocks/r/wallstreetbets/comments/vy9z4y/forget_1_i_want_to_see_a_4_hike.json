Drinking those shitty left over warm budweisers from the night before might help you cope with reality this morning, but its going to make you doubley fucked as soon as you run out of booze.\n\nAnd no, you can't just drink forever.\n\nIf you don't stop pounding the swish and push it too hard, you are actually just going to start puking your brains out - and in the worst case scenario - get alcohol poisoning and have to go to the hospital.\n\nSTOP DRINKING.\n\nThe Fed needs to stop being fucking cute and admit that we are in way the fuck over our heads.\n\nThis chart confirms what your credit card statement is already telling you:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tofyp9gmdb91.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=517f9ccd5453a428b2adc3d326516c6cbe146e04\n\n# TRANSLATION -&gt; INFLATION IS COMPOUNDING EXPONENTIALLY.\n\nHere's the Canadian data for my fellow Canucks out there.
