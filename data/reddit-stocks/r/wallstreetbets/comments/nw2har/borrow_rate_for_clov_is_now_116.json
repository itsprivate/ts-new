For those that don’t know, CLOV is a healthcare company with limited shares available to trade because insiders can’t sell until the stock trades at $30 for a 90 day period. What’s interesting is that short sellers shorted the stock &gt;40% and now they have to fight with retail for the remaining stock to cover their shorts. But here’s the problem, they haven’t covered their shorts yet, the stock is up 100% and as you can see from the borrow fee, some are probably close to a margin call. They are scared shitless because this thing can go parabolic. I’m talking $50-100 a share! </p>\n\n<p>So what are shorts doing today? They predictably tried to crash the stock in the morning by shorting (selling borrowed shares) and that coincided with day traders taking profit. A pretty predictable tactic that is designed to scare retail into selling. Don’t let them fool you. This stock still has plenty of gas left, with an option chain up to $43 now!</p>\n\n<p>LETS FUCKING GOOOOO</p>\n\n<p>Positions: $11 calls , $12 calls , $13 calls and $35 calls</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Fuck off with the 🤡🤡🤡 posts, it won’t save your favourite ticket and/or it won’t help you with your short position.</p>\n\n<p>After market update: </p>\n\n<p>Well today was wild. What we saw was a combination of short sellers fighting back, probably some profit taking and perhaps a gamma ramp down. But the facts of the stock still remain the same. The stock is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shorted by more than 40%</li>\n<li>More than 15% of the float is locked up with insiders WHO cannot sell</li>\n<li>Shorts are now even more underwater with crazy high borrow rates on their new shorted shares </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When people talk about the VW squeeze. There’s always a period before the spike where the stock dips. That dip was today. Now it remains on longs to keep pushing and we’re going to really benefit from a bigger option chain and another gamma ramp upwards.
