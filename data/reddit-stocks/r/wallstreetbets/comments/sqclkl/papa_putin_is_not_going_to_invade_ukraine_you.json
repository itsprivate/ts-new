A big Russian bear trap.\n\nStop putting your money into puts as though Putin is gonna somehow launch an invasion and tank the entire market.\n\nI'm gonna tell you why, so listen up you mouth breathing clowns.\n\n1 - I bet the majority of you talking about this 'InVaSiOn' are getting your information from fucking CNN. The US media is keen to portray Putin as some demonic harbinger of doom, and its a convienant distraction from the fact that you're all going to be homeless soon because food and fuel cost a fortune and mortgages are going through the roof. Quick, lets blame Putin.\n\n2 - This is classic Putin mindset. He's one of the biggest trolls on the world stage. He took the piss in Crimea because Obama was weak as fuck. Remember in August 2012, Obama drew his \"red line\" against Syria if Assad used chemical weapons? Fucking eye doctor Assad then went and dropped a shitload of chemical weapons and the US did jack shit. 18 months later, Putin gambled on a weak assed Obama doing fuck all and rolled his troops into Crimea and stole it. Biden seems to have a more firm stance and Putin is testing for weakness.\n\n3 - Russia doesn't even fucking need Ukraine. To what purpose does Putin want it? It's fucking dogshit. Ukraine has nothing of any worth to Russia, apart from Nostalgia. Can you imagine Russia taking control of the whole country? \"*Ok Putin, here you go, by the way, our population of 41 million people doesn't want you here, so have fun with that. Oh, and there's also this little place called Chernobyl we take care of. Here, have it fucking back*\".\n\n4 - What is Putin actually moving up? The media always talks about \"OmG PuTiN DePloYs TrOoPS!!\" Yeah ok, but what. Most of the pictures i've seen are of the T-72b3 variant, which is a dogshit revamp of the old T-72 which is way outdated. The UK and the US have already delivered a fucktonne of AT weapons to Ukraine which can cause more damage than 0DTE fd's. Back in 2015, Russia deployed some T-72's against Ukraine's troops and they got rinsed. Ukraine even trolled them by capturing some and using them against the other Russian vehicles.\n\n5 - 100,000 troops. That's all Putin has put on the border. \"**OMG THAT'S LOADS!!**\" No it fucking isn't. It took the US nearly double that to invade Iraq back in '03 and Ukraine is 25% bigger. You can also gurantee that the reistance from the military of Ukraine will be a damn sight more fierce than a bunch of Iraq conscripts who fucking hated Saddam and didn't even want to fight in the first place. Speaking of Saddam, it took him nearly 300,000 troops to invade Kuwait, which is about the size of your wifes boyfriends spare bedroom. That's there one where he rails her while you bumpkins are trying to figure out why Robinhood has fucked you over again.\n\n6 - When Putin took Crimea, it took him just 6 days. The president was looking unstable and within a week, Putin moved troops in and took control. he didnt spend months teasing anyone and telegraphing his moves like he is now. \n\nHistory lesson over.\n\nIn short, shut up. Putin isn't going to invade. He's pulling a classic KGB commie troll move. All you üåàüêª stop pissing money away on puts. He's probably got SPY puts expiring in a few weeks and needs them to print before he calls it all off and everyone goes home. \n\nFinally, even if Uncle Putin does invade, that means the US is just gonna throw everything it has at defence contractors, so get your Lockheed calls in right now.\n\nTLDR - Shut up. Putin is trolling. He is master troll. no invasion. puts get fucked.",
