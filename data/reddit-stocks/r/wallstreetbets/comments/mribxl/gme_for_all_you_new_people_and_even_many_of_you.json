  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.</p>\n\n<p>I have a significant position in GME.  I bought in around $100, have been constantly buying more over time, and have held from $350 to today&#39;s price (currently $156).  I will continue to buy/hold.  I&#39;m not here to give you a floor, but I can sure as hell guarantee you that I&#39;m not selling my shares anywhere near 1k.</p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t lie to y&#39;all, I originally bought in solely for the squeeze potential, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here anymore.  We don&#39;t know if the squeeze will squooze, but what we do know is that we will profit handsomely if we&#39;re patient.  Let&#39;s go over a few things:</p>\n\n<p><strong>(1) No one knows the short interest (SI).  There are zero reliable sources for SI data.  Everything that you see is entirely speculation.  Therefore, no one knows if shorts have covered or fucking quintupled down or worse.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(2) If we are truly a part of one of the most heinous financial conspiracies that the world has even seen, I guarantee you the MOASS will NOT occur until the proper safeguards are in place, i.e. NSCC/DTCC/OCC regulations.  If the market can be manipulated to fuck retail, it can be manipulated to delay a MOASS until certain measures are in place.  These regulations may not be fully approved for 2-3 months.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(3) Gamestop, led by Ryan Cohen, is beginning a fundamental transformation.   They paid off their debt.  They&#39;re replacing nearly all of their top level execs.  They&#39;re forming an e-commerce company with people who were part of building some of the most successful e-commerce companies in existence. If/when this transformation is successful, it could result in GME&#39;s price reaching more than $1000 in the next 1-3 years or so.  This is completely independent of any squeeze.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>I believe that illegal market manipulation is taking place, there&#39;s a ridiculous amount of short interest, the MOASS will eventually occur, and on top of that the Gamestop transformation will be wildly successful.  I don&#39;t know when the MOASS could happen.  I can&#39;t possibly estimate a floor since I don&#39;t know the real short interest.  What I do know is that this is the best investment opportunity that I&#39;ve ever seen and here&#39;s the best way to think about this play:</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you believe in the transformation thesis, this should be the easiest investment play of your life.  Some of us bought in a $4, $40, or even $400.  Let&#39;s assume most people&#39;s average share price is $200.  So if the price were to get to $1000, then you&#39;ve made 5x your initial investment.  That&#39;s fucking insane.  You can&#39;t go anywhere in the world and find a (legal and cheap buy in) investment opportunity that has a pretty damn good chance of giving you a 5x return and all you have to do is wait a few years.</li>\n<li>If the MOASS occurs, and the majority of people believe in (1), then one would assume that those people will hold to far beyond low $XXXX.  Why wouldn&#39;t you?  You believe that the price is going to get near there relatively soon anyway.  Again, I&#39;m not here to set a floor, but if GME squeezes, I will say that I won&#39;t sell below $XXXXX, and I&#39;d hope that even the most paper handed of apes wouldn&#39;t either.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So to reiterate: even if there is no squeeze, even if all the shorts have covered, even if some demonic intervention takes place and fucks over retail letting the shorters escape, if you hold, there&#39;s a very good chance that you&#39;re going to get make a ridiculous return.  I&#39;d love to be a part of this transformation, and I&#39;m more than happy to wait for my tendies.</p>\n\n<p>🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  <strong>💎🙌🏼</strong>  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
