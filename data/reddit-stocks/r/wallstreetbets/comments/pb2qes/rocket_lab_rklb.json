Next take away the big rockets (and replace with 17m tall rockets that change colors when being fueled up, called ‘Electron’).\n\nWhat you have left is a company that’s trading at roughly 4 to 5 billion market cap (far cry from SpaceX’s 80 to 90 billion) that has successfully launched over 100 satellites to orbit, and the clear 2nd in the private orbital launch service domain.\n\nWhy I have loaded up on Rocket Lab:\n\n1. Low market valuation relative to peers (i.e SpaceX is already at lofty valuation, leaving less room for price growth, believe around $90 billion). Virgin galactic was trading at almost 2x the market cap, $10 billion, for a while with a lot less to show for it, and countless delays. Astra is trading about half the market cap of rocket lab (without even delivering 1 customer payload to orbit yet?).\n\n2. Proven ability to get to orbit. 20+ successful launches, with 100+ satellites in orbit.\n\n3. Small rockets aren’t as bad of a limitation as you’d think initially, actually provides greater flexibility with launch dates, and more granular orbit positions for customer satellites (and I’ve read that 98% of satellites would be able to fit on electron, but I need to find the link that references this).\n\n4. Plans to use raised capital to fund larger ‘Neutron’ rocket, being built for human space flight, and to further compete with SpaceX as an orbital launch provider for satellite constellations.\n\nRocket lab will finally list tomorrow as $RKLB, and will be ringing the opening bell on NASDAQ tomorrow morning.\n\nPositions: I have a lot of shares",
