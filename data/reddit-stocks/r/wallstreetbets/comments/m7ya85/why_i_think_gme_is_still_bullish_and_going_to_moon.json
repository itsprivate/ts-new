Many of you might even have stopped eating crayons or worse: sold your $GME stocks with huge losses. </p>\n\n<p>I want to use this chance to tell you that not all is lost. Nothing is lost (until you sell in fact!). Of course I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about - I&#39;m really no one to trust in financial advice, so be aware. </p>\n\n<p>But still I am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining. Trends in stocks need corrections, that&#39;s basic DOW-theory. And how much do they correct in general? A 0.5 Fib-retracement correction is very usual in almost all trends. They even sometimes correct a fib-retracement below. </p>\n\n<p>So when you&#39;re looking at my chart now (very fancy, colors!, buy!) you will see that we&#39;re pretty exact around that retracement now. Furthermore price tried to go under EMA50 but directly went up again to the exact position of EMA50. Where are we now?  Correct, almost at EMA50 but NOT below. This is a hell of a resistance and we&#39;re not letting it fall below my fellow apes!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore EMA100 and EMA200 are still showing upward movement, which is also good. </p>\n\n<p>Last but not least MACD aims for its zero-line and might turn positive. You ask when? Hm, if you look at the MACD trend it might be tomorrow, Friday 03/19 (and we are all hoping for a beginning squeeze on that day, don&#39;t we?!)</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, from my perspective everything is still fine. For disclosure, I&#39;m stuck in the upper 300s in GME, and I won&#39;t sell before we reach at least four digits! </p>\n\n<p>TL:DR: Trend is still fine, EMA50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement tomorrow, Friday 03/19 or coming Monday. I like the stock and you should like it too. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rwn267m02un61.png?width=2091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09182b5399332de89d5a0db97254e1762fad8278\">My technical analysis on $GME</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
