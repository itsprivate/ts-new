  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There are lots of posts calling out all of the naysayers and ninnies that are obviously plants sent here to stir up chaos. Clearly it&#39;s working in all kinds of forms - there are certainly people folding and falling prey, but to what extent, who knows. There are posts that are manipulative on all kinds of levels, from careful timing of GME gain porn in the millions, to straight trash talk to GME holders, even posts on other subreddits trash talking GME holders. Anyone that&#39;s been here a while knows this kind of trash talk especially isn&#39;t normal or okay, it&#39;s not what we&#39;re about. We LOVE when people fuck up and lose a bunch of money, it&#39;s a fucking celebration, not a witch hunt. So what is a lone ape in a scary crowded jungle to do? Think about your situation. A large hedge fund vs. Reddit army story was shot out into the public. Mysteriously, buying ability was cut before the projected timing of the squeeze on social media. Shortly after, there were many warning posts of the remaining dirty tactics that we would face in the coming weeks, the serious manipulation, and the fact that it would realistically work on a lot of people. Mark Cuban stopped by, gave us some sweet tips, and warned us that very likely they think they&#39;re smarter than us &amp; kept shorting. We are now in those coming weeks, and we are being mercilessly invaded with BS. This clearly indicates that there is an active effort to manipulate our users, which is a sign to me that we are on the path to doing some damage, and who else would target this community in this way? They have picked their side of this tug of war. Now, what side have others picked? Ask yourself this - if you were ANOTHER hedge fund right now, or any wealthy individual who dabbles in investing, would you jump on the short train and try to bankrupt Gamestop, kick back and watch, or buy GME? You are all out here looking like fools if you think the rich people that AREN&#39;T shorting GME aren&#39;t trying to jump on this fucking money rocket. These people are rich for a reason, they are playing fucking 4D chess on y&#39;all stupid fucks while you pick your nose and can&#39;t remember why you bought the stock you literally bought two fucking weeks ago. You have doubts now because your 30 year old neighbor who invests in bonds made a comment about how loaded you&#39;d be if you sold at $400. Stay strong in your resolve, take note of the clues around you, and remember what convinced you this was a good decision in the first place. Unless you&#39;re a mouth breathing humanoid who just wanted to 10x their pathetic life savings instantly and bought in without reading more than three sentences, in which case, you&#39;re probably in the right place so just shut the fuck up for a while until this blows over. </p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice I kinda just like the stock.  </p>\n\n<p>🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr - there are a lot of other people/hedge funds that invest money that aren&#39;t active on WSB or currently shorting GME, and they&#39;ve probably put some thought into how they can most profit off of this situation based on actual analysis. I&#39;m not one of those smart guys but it seems like usually the answer where more rich people get richer is how it goes.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I&#39;ve been looking at users tonight and noticed there are seemingly bots that got in early enough to pretend to be in on the hold, all just to make it even more convincing when they decide to sell. There are also bots offering to pay redditors to post about selling GME, and maybe redditors are taking the bribe even if they aren&#39;t selling in true WSB degenerate fashion. Anyways, I think I&#39;m going to get off this sub and hold until this all blows over...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
