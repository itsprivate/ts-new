Ryan Cohen is not just rejuvenating a retailer. \n\nRyan is building a tech giant. He's poaching from tech giants. He achieved the balance sheet ratios of a tech giant during the squeezes. He has the strategic vision, focus, skin in the game, and conservative financial approach of a tech giant founder. He *is* a tech founder/billionaire (Chewy). Current tech giants have physical footprints the same size as GameStop or larger. Ryan knows what the potential is, which is why he hasn't sold a single share despite being up 2,135% as of today's close.\n\nPower comes from strategic position. GameStop is not in a powerful position, but Ryan took on this project because he saw the necessary elements and a path to achieve a powerful position. Since then he's been working his ass off for shareholders with this as his sole focus. You didn't see much tangible progress, because the first year was the secretive, big-picture stage. He has promised the market nothing and he will easily over deliver this year. None of this is new information, but it is missing from any Wall St take on GME. They're too busy laughing at apes a year later.\n\nTL;DR: I like the stock.",
