A portion of everyone's salary is automatically invested into the market.\n\n4. The US stock market is 55% of the world market and attracts capital from all over the world.  Stocks are being boosted not just by American firms and individuals, but people from all of over the world allocate their wealth in the US market and hedge against their own domestic inflation and uncertainties. \n\n5. QE. Fresh money is printed and put in the stock market.\n\nMost importantly - FOLLOW THE MONEY: Where does the money go when someone sells their stock?  \n\n1. If the money goes in the bank: The bank will invest or lend out that money, which will find its way back to the market.\n2. If the money gets spent: It will find its way back to the market through the producer of the goods and services from 401k of employees, the investment/bank of the producer.\n\n3. Reinvest at the \"dip\".\n\n4. Invest in other assets like Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or commodities such as Oil, Silver and Gold.  Which arguably carries more risk or lower growth, and doesn't encourage national economic growth at the same level as the stock market. \n\n5. Invest in pre-IPO companies. Which sees most of the ROI when it goes public.\n\nMoney always find its way into the market.  The stock market is the engine that drives innovations and new business ventures.",
