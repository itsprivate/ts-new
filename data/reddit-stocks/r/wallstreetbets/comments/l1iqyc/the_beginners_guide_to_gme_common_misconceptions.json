If you&#39;re the type of person to write this comment, please educate yourself and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/\">read this excellent analysis on the GME stock itself.</a></p>\n\n<p>tldr: dont sell holy shit u fucking retard just hold💎🙌 and you have the potential of selling at ludicrous prices later</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>IM GONNA TAKE OUT ROBINHOOD MARGIN TO BUY MORE HUEHUEHU IM GREEDY AF</em></strong> 😈😈😈</p>\n\n<p>Shorters (big bad companies) can &quot;borrow&quot; your margin stock to climb themselves out of the real bad hole they&#39;re in. If you buy with cash, they <strong>cannot.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are literally working against yourself and the entire community if you buy stocks on margin.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>OK DEN ILL DO OPTIONS???</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>No. The only thing putting pressure on companies who are shorting are <strong>SHARES.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Again, you are hurting yourself and the cause if you buy anything but shares.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>WHEN IS SHORT SQUEEZE?!!? HOW DO I TIME IT???? PRICE TARGET??!?!?</em></strong> <em>🐑🐑🐑</em></p>\n\n<p>Nobody knows for sure. All we know is that companies that are shorting GME stock are losing <strong>b i g m o n e y</strong> as GME stock continues to stay this high, and they&#39;ll thwart and prevent it as best as they can before they eventually give in.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, big short squeezes last anywhere from a full day to a full week. Please refer to the <a href=\"https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/\">VW Squeeze</a> and/or the <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147768239357820929/801235457153302599/bbfbe8f8d0.png\">TSLA Squeeze.</a> These things don&#39;t happen within a few minutes people, you have time.</p>\n\n<p>Price targets in the short term are very tricky to pin down. <a href=\"https://www.gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-20Jan21.pdf\">Here&#39;s a very well done analysis</a> of potential LONG-TERM estimates by our friend <a href=\"/u/Uberkikz11\">/u/Uberkikz11</a>. As for short term squeeze price target? Most of the retard sentiment here is <strong><em>hoping</em></strong> for a squeeze anywhere from $300 to $1000, again very hard to pin down.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Alright, now that you&#39;re caught up to speed, let&#39;s go through some</p>\n\n<h1>COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT GME</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Gamestop has added 6k+ new jobs up for listing!</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l00o7e/gamestop_posts_thousands_of_new_jobs/gjqy92q/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Debunked</a>, HOWEVER they are adding a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/komelh/gme_careers_as_a_reflection_of_their_roadmap/\">few particular jobs that weren&#39;t there before</a>, meaning while they aren&#39;t hiring 7k new people, they&#39;re adding positions that make this new transformation that much more sexy</p>\n\n<p><strong>WE CONTROL THE MARKET@@!!!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, WSB is definitely quite a sizeable chunk and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/\">probably owns just under 10% of GME shares now</a> but you have to remember, there is big money involved. <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings\">GME is owned by a lot of institutions that have way more power than WSB does.</a></p>\n\n<p>I know, I know, autist together = stronk but let&#39;s not get <em>too</em> ahead of ourselves and pretend we can make GME blast off on a moments notice. We DO have power, just stop being mega-autistic about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GME GONNA HIT $1000 LIKE VOLKSWAGEN AND ITS GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW</strong></p>\n\n<p>You know, I was leaning towards GME squeezing VW-esque for a fair bit as well <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyn0nz/should_you_buy_gme_shortsqueezes_and_the/\">(although I was skeptical)</a></p>\n\n<p>However I&#39;m <em>really</em> convinced this is going to take a fair bit more time, weeks to months for anything resembling a squeeze. With more data coming in, GME really does seem like it&#39;s being set up for a <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147768239357820929/801235457153302599/bbfbe8f8d0.png\">TSLA-esque squeeze</a> and hell tbh I&#39;m hoping that it does do that instead. <strong><em>I mean look at that shit</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SET LIMIT SELL ORDERS....? OR DON&#39;T??</strong></p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s tons of speculation on whether if setting limit high limit sell orders (420.69, 694.20) actually makes it so your broker can lower that shit and kind of forcibly sell your stock.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but personally I&#39;m watching this shit constantly so I&#39;m not setting limits at all but I&#39;m actually not too sure which advice is good to follow, maybe it depends on the broker as well?</p>\n\n<p><del>Will edit, please correct me if you have the answer.</del></p>\n\n<p>edit: check comments, still am not personally sure about limit sell orders.</p>\n\n<p>again, checking this stock once/twice a day is good enough to not set limits at all.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thank you beginner for reading this far, however your work may not be over. You could YOLO your life savings or (I HIGHLY SUGGEST) you could continue reading up on the DD Analysis done here on <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">/r/wallstreetbets</a></p>\n\n<p>I know reddit search is retarded so here is a personal curated list of what I think are the most helpful links to getting a much deeper understanding of GME.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/\">One DD to rule them all</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/\">Looking at GME as a Venture Capitalist</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-20Jan21.pdf\">Literal boomer (but really fucking well done) analysis by our friend</a> <a href=\"/u/Uberkikz11\">/u/Uberkikz11</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann\">his twitter</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyn0nz/should_you_buy_gme_shortsqueezes_and_the/\">My previous beginner friendly explanation, Short-squeezes and why you should HOLD</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf\">Ryan Cohen&#39;s letter to Gamestop: MAXIMIZING STOCKHOLDER VALUE by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And yes, this is not professional financial advice, you are taking a risk on your own behalf, I myself and everyone else on here is a retard blah blah blah... <sup>but actually pls buy gme this is a once in a decade event</sup></p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR:</h1>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re a beginner, please educate yourself before dumping money into GME.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to suck Cramers🍆 on live television if I have to see another retard comment in the daily thread.</p>\n\n<p>If you do have money in GME, continue to 💎🙌 and I&#39;ll see you retard soldiers on the moon 🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
