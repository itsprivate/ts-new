Regardless of what you think of the company's future, MOASS, the cult-like hopium echo chamber, etc when looking at the chart over the past year, it's really hard to deny that there has been some cyclical price movement.  And guess what, we're in the process of making another run, as expected based on previous cycles.   Some nice green dildos so far this week with Tuesday +13% and Wednesday +7.5% but have no fear,  you haven't missed your chance to yolo in you fucking degens.\n\nTake a look at this very dumbed down chart:  [https://i.imgur.com/5IHrw0g.png](https://i.imgur.com/5IHrw0g.png)\n\nAll I'm trying to show here is the approximate 60-trading day cycle that we can track over the past year from peak to peak. It's important to note that the sneeze last January was not tied to any of these cycles.   Based on the 60-day cycle, the current run will peak around 2/18, which is in line with a big OPEX clearing date.  What happened around this time last year?  how about the stock more than doubling over a 2 day period.  If we can break the year-long trend and run into OPEX, a  significantly larger move up is possible.\n\nWhile the stock is the lowest it's been in quite some time, it's primed for a big move thanks in part to the options chain.\n\nHere's some fun options activity from today:  [https://i.imgur.com/5hkr52g.png](https://i.imgur.com/5hkr52g.png)\n\nSome  pretty nice call buying pressure coming in.   The put/call ratio has  flipped to heavily favor calls, both in volume and premiums.\n\nOrtex Data:  [https://i.redd.it/fmwok3vxitg81.png](https://i.redd.it/fmwok3vxitg81.png)\n\nConsidering  short positions are self-reported and I don't really trust Ortex data  this all has to be taken with a giant fucking grain of salt but it's  interesting to note that over the past month cost to borrow and  utilization is the highest they've been since before last January with  utilization reaching 100% today. There are some interesting theories as  to why we're seeing this now but that's too complicated for me and not  important to the point i'm trying to make.\n\nTo show my level of weaponized autism, you can see my positions below.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/mk5EArk.png](https://i.imgur.com/mk5EArk.png)\n\nOh also, [https://i.redd.it/dkzcb7poux381.jpg](https://i.redd.it/dkzcb7poux381.jpg)\n\nThe  data i reference has bIeen pulled from various posts/DD of late and is  not my original content. Considering my extremely low IQ, I'm not nearly  capable of coming to these conclusions on my own.  What's been  particularly pleasing to my smooth brain is how multiple people have  come to similar conclusions around these cycles, even when taking  different approaches to get to the same end place.\n\nok, now i'm ready for the gme hate...",
