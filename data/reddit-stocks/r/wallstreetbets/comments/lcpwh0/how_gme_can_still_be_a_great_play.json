Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>They also have an email  in case you can&#39;t call [<a href=\"mailto:investorrelations@gamestop.com\">investorrelations@gamestop.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:investorrelations@gamestop.com\">investorrelations@gamestop.com</a>)</p>\n\n<p>If you want more information <a href=\"https://investor.gamestop.com/home\">https://investor.gamestop.com/home</a></p>\n\n<p>I HOPE I DONT HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT BE KIND IN YOUR MESSAGES AND EMAILS!!!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>here&#39;s a good read by someone smarter than me <a href=\"https://www.gmeretail.com\">https://www.gmeretail.com</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Template written by u/<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AVeryRealHumanity/\">AVeryRealHumanity</a></p>\n\n<p>Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud</p>\n\n<p>Hello,</p>\n\n<p>My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I&#39;ve used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company&#39;s stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time,</p>\n\n<p>Power to the players,</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Precocious_Kid\">u/Precocious_Kid</a> brought up a point: We should ask for a reverse stock split. &quot;In the event that the reverse stock split happens, Citadel and the phantom shares creators will be stuck holding all of their losses on those short positions!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
