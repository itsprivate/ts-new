Elon has 14.8 billion dollars of tax due when he exercises his options (which he has to do before August 20th, 2022), he can significantly reduce the tax bill by billions of dollars by dropping the Tesla stock price. Selling 10% of his shares covers all of his taxes and leaves him roughly a billion dollars in cash to play with.  Basically, he's using Twitter to lower his taxes.\n\nPositions: straddles.\n\nEdit: In regards to the question by u/SaladTossgaming on getting puts: I'm thinking about it as well but concerned about IV. Also, the gamma position on Nasdaq is insane, we may be in for a parabolic run. I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla goes to 2k. Would love other's opinions on this.\n\nEdit 2: not bullish or bearish on tesla price. Simply commenting on the selling.\n\nEdit 3: Slightly out of context but pertaining to a question in one of the comments.  There was $450 million of ITM call buying (January 2024 $1000 strikes) in a single day last week.  That's not only a significant dollar amount but also, similar positioning had occurred prior to the SPX inclusion and share split.  Sorry if this causes confusion about what action(s) to take but it's part of the reason why I'm neither bullish nor bearish (see Edit 2). Note - option flow isn't the clearest indicator; for example, a large holder of Tesla may have had to sell their shares due to Tesla becoming too large of a % in their portfolio (required to sell per portfolio risk management), however - since they still want to participate in the upside they may have purchased ITM options to compensate for the sale.",
