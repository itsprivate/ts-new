That is what I am going to be.</p>\n\n<p>I believe in my ideas. I believe in myself. I know why I&#39;m here today.</p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t let myself down just because I see some red days (or green days!).</p>\n\n<p>No matter how things will turn out to be. No matter how red a day / week / month will be.</p>\n\n<p>I will <strong>hold.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Edit: This is not just about GME, this is a general discussion</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Edit II: Guys I&#39;m not saying that diamond handing was all there is to DFV&#39;s success. Of course his extraordinary DD and his education did most of the work, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it was easy to hold through the tough times. What I&#39;m trying to tell you is that his conviction and determination should be taken as an example</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Edit II: Wow thank you guys for all the awards, glad you enjoyed!</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
