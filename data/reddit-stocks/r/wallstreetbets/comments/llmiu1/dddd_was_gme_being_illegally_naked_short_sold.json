This is a continuation of a similar analysis I did <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/larhlw/dddd_is_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/\">last time</a> when the last data set was released, with a few modifications. Since I&#39;m sure 99% of y&#39;all are barely going to read this entire thing, let alone read a second wall of text, I&#39;ll just re-use some of the content and explanations in this post.</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don&#39;t buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a Failure to Deliver?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/\">see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you&#39;re curious</a>. This can happen for many reason, and in the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm\">examples given by the SEC</a> includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they&#39;re able to later source that share quickly after it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Methodology &amp; Caveats</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to process the raw SEC data and join it with some market data from an API, which I&#39;ll paste below. This processed, enriched data, which I have uploaded <a href=\"https://www.file.io/download/SbQSw9PUtZfS\">here</a> for anyone wrinkle-brained enough to dig through the data themselves, is then analyzed by another script to answer several questions to help definitively show what sort of involvement of naked short selling in GME during Jan 15 - 29. The answers we&#39;re going to specifically answer is</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How many days saw a significant amount of FTDs for GME, and how does that compare to other stocks?</li>\n<li>What was the total value of FTDs of GME during this period, and how does it compare to other stocks?</li>\n<li><strong>What % of the volume for GME couldn&#39;t be delivered during this time?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The last part is the most important imo, since GME accounted for an absurdly large portion of the market&#39;s volume for multiple days in January, so if you don&#39;t normalize for volume you&#39;ll obviously have GME top every analysis in absolute terms.</p>\n\n<p>Now, <strong>these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers</strong> because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.</li>\n<li>The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred (i.e. T+2 settlement), so <strong>literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day&#39;s volume</strong>. However, I&#39;m going to make an assumption that a day&#39;s volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results if anyone goes through the raw data.</li>\n<li>The dollar value itself is wrong because it&#39;s using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out while answering those questions, so it should give a fairly accurate, albeit imperfect, representation of this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Code</strong></p>\n\n<p>Feel free to skip this section if y&#39;all are code illiterate, but putting this here for transparency and so that someone can call me out if I&#39;m making any of the results up or if I have a bug somewhere, which considering I threw this together in less than an hour, probably is the case. If you do see something wrong pls comment and I&#39;ll fix it if it&#39;s legitimate.</p>\n\n<p><em>Processing Code</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>import json\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport time\nimport requests\n\nPOLYGON_API_KEY = &#39;&lt;POLYGON API KEY HERE&gt;&#39;\nVOLUME_DATA_API_URL = &#39;https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=&#39;

$25M (8 days) and cumulative value of FTDs (&gt; $1B) in the SEC list</p>\n\n<p>but</p>\n\n<p>Both can be explained by the fact that GME accounted for a disproportionately large amount of the total volume during the period. If you <strong>normalize by volume, GME becomes the 66th stock with the most Failure to Delivers</strong>. While this may show that a few players have been doing something sketchy, it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s any systematic fraud going on.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT - I&#39;m an idiot and forgot to * 100 for percentage.
