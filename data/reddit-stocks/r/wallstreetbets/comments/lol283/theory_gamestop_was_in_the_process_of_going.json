  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I was just poking around randomly on Google. I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape-like conspiracy.</p>\n\n<p>Short end of it, I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain my thought process. Maybe I&#39;m retarded but you apes help me to see if I&#39;m crazy or autistic.</p>\n\n<p>The real estate connection begins with this PDF document:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf\">https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>CCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit.</p>\n\n<p>The PDF starts off innocently. Just a thank you note, President&#39;s Forward and random ads.</p>\n\n<p>But then it begins to list a directory of members. On Page 46 there&#39;s a strange coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>Gamestop&#39;s real estate leasing manager, Christopher Morris is listed.</p>\n\n<p>Right underneath is Scott A. Morris of...... Citadel Partners LLC.</p>\n\n<p>I was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn&#39;t seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords. Just... a really funny coincidence. Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol</p>\n\n<p>But then I did some other digging and found a random document:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&amp;id2=0\">https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&amp;id2=0</a></p>\n\n<p>Which is a voting form for Ascena Retail Group&#39;s bankruptcy filing.</p>\n\n<p>On page 49 and 50 something jumped out at me:</p>\n\n<p>GOLDMAN SACHS &amp; CO -- F/A/O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP -- ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT</p>\n\n<p>Idk if it&#39;s well known, because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin&#39;s accounts.</p>\n\n<p>I looked further into it and found:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd\">https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Custodian</strong> Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co LLC, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co LLC, National Financial Services LLC</p>\n\n<p>Melvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan.</p>\n\n<p>And it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory. I can&#39;t find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage\">https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage</a></p>\n\n<p>So would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris, Gamestop&#39;s regional leasing manager, Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 (<a href=\"https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/\">https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/</a>) and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially?</p>\n\n<p>And then at that point word got around to Melvin who&#39;s probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it&#39;s a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop?</p>\n\n<p>Then all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they&#39;ve ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin&#39;s hard insider traded tendies.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a cooky theory but plausible.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Forgot to mention current position 48 @ $77 </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
