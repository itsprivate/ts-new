As the prices surges, Market Makers are forced to write more calls and buy shares before they even become available, surging the price higher. </p>\n\n<p>So, now because we have fallen all the way back down to $40, we have a catapult cocked down as far as it can go, ready to be launched.</p>\n\n<p>There are <em>millions, and millions, and</em> <strong><em>millions</em></strong> of shares written in those call options all the fucking way up to 800. These shares are not only buried in the 2/26 calls, but also every single date after this as well. <strong><em>So many fucking shares.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If we can get to 800 and <em>all these calls become</em> <strong><em>in the money</em></strong> the Market Makers will have to scramble to buy millions and millions of shares that will surge the price up.</p>\n\n<p>The craziest part is that this does not even take into account the shorts covering. So, as the Mother of All Gamma Squeezes squozes, sending the price into the thousands, the shorts will then also be skyrocketing the price at infinitely higher prices.</p>\n\n<p>If you did not read my last dd <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/\">here</a> about GME short interest being 400%, we learned that <a href=\"/u/thabat\">u/thabat</a> ran an AI-generated model of GME’s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme <strong><em>$130k a share.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Now, while I then believed this to be a completely outlandish number, I now believe to have realized that this gamma squeeze that will occur if we hit 800, <strong><em>is what it predicted.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p><em>To reiterate:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I believe that the AI-Model of GameStop&#39;s share price, which predicts $130k a share, is predicting this because it believes that we will hit 800 before 2/26, therefore causing the</em> <strong><em>M</em></strong><em>other</em> <strong><em>o</em></strong><em>f</em> <strong><em>A</em></strong><em>ll</em> <strong><em>G</em></strong><em>amma</em> <strong><em>S</em></strong><em>queezes. Which will</em> <strong><em>then</em></strong> <em>trigger the infinity short squeeze which sends us to $100k+.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Many others are also starting to realize this as well, check out this post on <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/</a></p>\n\n<p>While this is not financial advice, it is in my opinion that we need to do our best in holding and buying in order to get the stock price above $800 before Friday. This AI believes we fucking did it, lets prove the future right.</p>\n\n<p>💎🙌  </p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/rocket/\">🚀</a></h3>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
