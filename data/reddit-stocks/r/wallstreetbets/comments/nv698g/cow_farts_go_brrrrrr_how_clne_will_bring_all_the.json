Only problem is that we seem to be a bit scattered currently with almost 7 different tickers being mentioned over and over again.  Let&#39;s get straight to the point, we want to make money.  (By the way I&#39;m not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded).  Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:</p>\n\n<p><strong>CLNE.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked.  But we&#39;re talking about Mr. Clean right now.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Well, it&#39;s the only one with the government on our side.  Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles?  This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call &quot;Renewable Natural Gas&quot; (RNG).  </p>\n\n<p><strong>So how the fuck are they doing this??</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let me explain.  The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that&#39;s not a good number for us.  But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that&#39;s captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative.  And who eats this shit up??  Amazon.  Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon&#39;s warehouses.  Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://investors.cleanenergyfuels.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clean-energy-signs-agreement-amazon-low-and-negative-carbon-rng\">Source</a>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Price</strong></p>\n\n<p>The stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being.  I&#39;m sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I&#39;m not going to go too deep into that.  Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10.  The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a company that&#39;s easily worth at least double what it&#39;s trading at right now but because of the small float it&#39;s pretty easy to manipulate.  The IB&#39;s are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week&#39;s last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it&#39;s an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short.  That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f\">https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Play?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Shares.  The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely.  And even if you don&#39;t play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  Cow farts go BRRRRRRR.  Super undervalued company that has great potential in the future and actually has the fundamentals to support it.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>10x 13C 6/18</p>\n\n<p>100 shares @ 8.73</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
