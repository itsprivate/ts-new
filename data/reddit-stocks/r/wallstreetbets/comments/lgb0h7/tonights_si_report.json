I want to caution my fellow autists from reading too much into this single piece of data. Let’s start with what we know about tonight’s report:</p>\n\n<p>1) This report is based on self reported data. </p>\n\n<p>2) The fine for misreporting, if caught, is pennies on the dollar compared to the costs to cover.</p>\n\n<p>3) The data report covers up until the 29th.</p>\n\n<p>So what are the possible outcomes:</p>\n\n<p>1) Data is accurate, HF covered: I believe at this point GME becomes a long play. There is the potential for an acquisition or a turn around/pivot in the business model. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.</p>\n\n<p>2) Data is accurate, HF did not cover: I believe the play here would be to buy as much as you can. This would push up the price pushing more expiring calls ITM and put further pressure on the HF. We would likely get a significant influx of new investment interest from retail and the squeeze is on. The play is buy and hold.</p>\n\n<p>3) Data is inaccurate: This is the most likely outcome given the money at stake. If it shows they haven’t covered then there would be no real sense in putting out false data. If it shows they have covered then it becomes a gut call. Personally, the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort, expense, etc. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.</p>\n\n<p>In all three scenarios buy and hold seems to be the most prudent course of action. The only reason to sell IMHO is if you believe GME will go bankrupt. </p>\n\n<p>Ok so I’m going to buy if I can or continue to hold ... what could happen that would turn this around?</p>\n\n<p>1) If not covered, a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze. Elon, Cuban, another HF, etc. Personally,I have my Tesla in my shopping cart already.</p>\n\n<p>2) If not covered, GME reverse stock split. This could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits.</p>\n\n<p>3) If not covered, emergency shareholder meeting. My understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote, this initiating the squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>4) If covered or uncovered, significant renewed public interest in GME. A lot more likely if uncovered, but it’s a strange world we live in so I wouldn’t completely rule it out if they covered.</p>\n\n<p>5) If covered or uncovered, GME public offering of 10 million shares at $x price (we will say $200). This sets a bottom for the stock in the short term, I believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around. I am actually a bit puzzled why this hasn’t already been done.</p>\n\n<p>6) If covered, GME being acquired by a major player at a reasonable price. This would ensure continuing good will from the existing shareholders and would ensure the GameStop name lives on.</p>\n\n<p>7) If covered, GME makes a strategic purchase or alliance that then starts to justify a higher evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously these are the thoughts of some retarded ape. Full disclosure, I am currently down around 100k in my positions on GME. In my mind, the invested funds were completely lost at the moment of purchase so it doesn’t bother me to hold forever or until I win, whichever comes first. 🦍🙌💎🚀🌕</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The report is supposed to reflect until the 29th.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
