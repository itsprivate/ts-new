Call it lucky or whatever, I did take a risk and it worked out, after failing over and over (especially with options).\n\nMore than 2 years ago just before covid I was introduced to FD's by this group and I was idiot buying puts when we witnessed greatest bull run in the history after covid crash.\n\nHowever today, I made up for all losses and more than doubled my portfolio where I was before covid.\n\nAll I want to tell all the retards here that Its ok to risk some when you're young. America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car everything needing an excellent credit score.\n\nOh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.\n\nWe all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck those 1% saving accounts. Go for the millions. If you don't make it, it doesn't matter anyways because most of us will die working. But at least you would have tried, which is more than the most.\n\nI Finally achieved goal of getting account to seven figures and now I decided not to buy any call/put options but might sell some occasionally.\n\nGood luck to all you degenerates, keep fighting and one day you will win or get lucky just like I did!!\n\nLink to portfolio snapshot: [https://imgur.com/a/u4Lw0Gu](https://imgur.com/a/u4Lw0Gu)",
