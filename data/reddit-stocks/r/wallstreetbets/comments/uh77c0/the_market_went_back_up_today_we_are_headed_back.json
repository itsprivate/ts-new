It just keeps going up.  Where as in past decades it went up and then back down again, this time, it just went up 4 times as much, and didn't go back down at all.  That is exactly why I believe it will keep going up, and by the end of the year, we will all be very rich.\n\nFurthermore, Elon Musk, leader of the most profitable car company in the world, just sent out a tweet telling his shareholders never to sell a stock they believe in.  Right after he sold $8.5 billion dollars worth of his own company's stock.  That is how dedicated he is to trading.\n\nSee the chart below:  This is what we in Finance refer to as a \"reverse camel toe\" or a \"sleeping giant formation.\"  See back in 2020, everyone thought this was the end of the bull market, and there was going to be a recession.  But actually, that was just a little hit, just the push that the American economy needed to *unlock its potential*.\n\nAfter that, the index skyrocketed.  I think that's exactly what is happening right now.  There is even more potential to be unlocked, and I am taking off my shorts and elongating my longs\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4tcbbjdi6x81.png?width=963&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44806f1ce19b707f6fb0c4aa461e0f3d35b8124f",
