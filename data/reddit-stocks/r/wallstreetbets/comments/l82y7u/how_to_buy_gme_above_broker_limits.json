If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY.

You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$GME is $300</li>\n<li>The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000</li>\n<li>Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).</li>\n<li>Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
