Unfortunately, after peaking above 330, after a series of trading halts, plummeted down to 198, with restabilization by EOD.</p>\n\n<p>To the unexperienced eye and paper hands, this looks like a time to sell.</p>\n\n<h1>However...</h1>\n\n<p>To the experienced trader, this is a textbook Salmon chart. Lemme explain it clearly to the retarded paper hands here.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a9906egsmbm61.jpg?width=1504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6488bd00fd49bf5615874b05f2a0517172fd2926\">The graph to a newbie</a></p>\n\n<h1>But if you look closely a pattern emerges</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zatemtj4nbm61.png?width=2224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c768bd643543c9828979aa58056b1a060197f5b\">Behold! The Sockeye salmon chart</a></p>\n\n<p>The Sockeye Salmon chart movement is a dead giveaway. It begins as a massive dip that goes below red (to match the color of breeding Sockeye), then some wacky shit for the ventral fin, and we have stabilized at the belly of the fish, in the green for approaching the head.</p>\n\n<h1>But what about the natural predator of salmon coming to spawn?</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/4qpbtglkpbm61.gif\">That’s right, gay bears are behind this shit.</a></p>\n\n<p>Bears the natural antithesis of salmon, and gay bears the antithesis of the retail traders. But how have the gay bears forced the stock to plummet? What manipulation did they have this time?</p>\n\n<h1>You may be familiar to ladder attacks, but let me introduce you to fish ladder attacks.</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wxxih8reqbm61.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=472de53d1dbb29bbe51b2c971242a4f098859d6f\">This is a fish ladder for the uninitiated </a></p>\n\n<p>Ladders allow fish to get upstream to spawn wealth, despite hedge funds preventing direct, uninhibited access. </p>\n\n<h1>Hedgefunds have stationed gay bears at the ladders to eat the incoming paperhanded salmon, which was the primary driver in today’s major crash.</h1>\n\n<h1>But what’s that tube representing retail trading?</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lc3itddgsbm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11792c453e0f6ee0c52f28a6ebde6166eb465b93\">A larger diagram explaining how the parties are interacting.</a></p>\n\n<h1>Thats right, its salmon tube time</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/5z7cp28ktbm61.gif\">But who’s loading the salmon?</a></p>\n\n<h1>Diamond hands, Ryan Cohen and other big players are literally loading willing salmon into the tube to bypass the gaybears and fish ladder attacks, to take us straight to valhalla for our tendie spawn.</h1>\n\n<h1>Prediction graph for the upcoming days</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/09itt4dstbm61.png?width=2224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e713b8049baed07ff6e6cc4c38da9b4b5c56fca\">https://preview.redd.it/09itt4dstbm61.png?width=2224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e713b8049baed07ff6e6cc4c38da9b4b5c56fca</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Come take me to the upstream, all you gotta do to HODL✋🏻💎🤚🏻🚀🐟</h1>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor or wildlife ecologist, this is not investment or fishery advice, I just like the stock and the sockeye</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
