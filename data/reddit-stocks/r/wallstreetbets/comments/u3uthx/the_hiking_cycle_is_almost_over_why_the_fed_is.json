  "selftext": "A few months ago I made this post about how [the fed is trapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1uf49/the_fed_is_trapped_they_have_to_hike_rates_but/) and can only raise rates roughly 5 times (in increments of 25bp) before they have to start easing again\n\nWell in that time, the market expectation for the number of hikes went from about **FOUR** 25bp hikes in 2022, to now the market pricing in **ELEVEN** 25bp hikes in 2022.\n\nThis absolute madness, and isn't going to happen.  The fed is talking a big game about hiking a ton to crush inflation, but they will instead crush the economy much more quickly than they think.  In fact, after just a single 25bp hike in March, we are roughly 75% done with this hiking cycle already.\n\nHow can that be?  Well the federal government is increasingly in massive debt, and the fed's secret mandate is to help them consistently refi this debt at lower yields to prevent a debt death cycle of increasing interest payments.\n\nJust take a look at how this has worked for the past 30 years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p94l7g7wxkt81.png?width=1483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=519081f19be85fe87217b765c734b53382d0d27b\n\nThe blue line (upper chart) is the federal debt multiplied by the average of the fed funds rate and the 5-year yield\n\nThe teal colored line (lower chart) is the fed funds rate.  Be sure to click on the chart so you can read it closely.\n\nBut basically any time the blue line hits that rising resistance level, the hiking cycle stops, without fail.\n\nThis is very inconvenient this time around for the fed, as they are getting screamed at by everyone about inflation, so they are going to have to quit the hiking cycle after just four more 25bp hikes (that could be just two 50bp hikes) while inflation is still raging.\n\nThey have to choose, inflation, or destroy the US economy.  People being able to afford less is the route politicians choose over people becoming unemployed and not being able to afford anything.  They will always choose mass discomfort over devastation for a sizable portion of the populace. People who have their lives destroyed are much louder than those who are a bit less comfortable month after month.\n\nAnd remember 2008?  The housing bubble? Well we are currently at risk of repeating that meltdown, and the fed is hell bent on never allowing another 2008 to occur.\n\nCheck out this chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hi13v5zpykt81.png?width=1483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c842e36213648e89fb168dec28a03e171b4bc87c\n\nThe blue line is the inflation adjusted mortgage payment index.  It's showing mortgage payment burdens for new home purchases are at the level that caused prices to start declining back in 2006-07.   The yellow line is the 30yr mortgage yield, and the green line is housing prices.\n\nThere are 3 ways to get that blue line back down into the \"safety zone\" as I'll call it.\n\n1. Lower nominal prices\n2. More inflation to cover for nominal price rises\n3. lower mortgage rates\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow lower nominal prices risks a housing crash, not something the fed wants. So using a combination of 2 and 3 is likely what we'll get.  And in fact, the 10yr yield (the yield that the 30yr mortgage prices off of the most) is looking very toppy just about now.\n\nIt's sitting precisely at it's 40-year resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lp8481y7zkt81.png?width=1483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8b38e2751de78e934054c5a68a40251bcbb9fea\n\nIf this chart breaks it means our financial markets break.  Our society is built on increasingly lower long term rates over time, and increasing debt levels. Is that sustainable over the very long term? Hell no.  But do you think Powell wants to be the fed chief that allows the system to collapse?\n\nThe 10yr is likely tapped out, the fed's jawboning on higher rates actually raises recession risk and is causing the curve to invert, meaning we can still get higher short term rates while long term rates top out or head lower on fears of the recession that the fed is guaranteed to cause with their rate hikes.\n\nBetween the housing market and the 10yr, the market is already telling the fed they don't have much more room to hike before they break things.\n\nSo what happens when the fed stops hiking while inflation is running hot?\n\nMore inflation, yield curve control via QE, and higher prices for real assets.  They are going to inflate away the debt by keeping interest rates on that debt lower than the rate of inflation and allowing nominal GDP to grow in proportion to that debt.  Thus shrinking the debt GDP ratio to a more a sustainable level.\n\nNow for what I like for the stagflationary environment the fed is creating:\n\nsilver, uranium, platinum, energy plays, real estate (in that order)\n\nTickers include PSLV and SILJ, SRUUF and URNM, PPLT or SPPP, USO and PXE, and for real estate I prefer the actual thing over REITS, but you can buy REITS if you like\n\nFeel free to ignore what I like and buy assets you think will be best in stagflation (which we haven't lived through since the 1970s).\n\nGood luck everyone! Never trust the fed!",

They are going to inflate away the debt by keeping interest rates on that debt lower than the rate of inflation and allowing nominal GDP to grow in proportion to that debt.  Thus shrinking the debt GDP ratio to a more a sustainable level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for what I like for the stagflationary environment the fed is creating:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;silver, uranium, platinum, energy plays, real estate (in that order)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tickers include PSLV and SILJ, SRUUF and URNM, PPLT or SPPP, USO and PXE, and for real estate I prefer the actual thing over REITS, but you can buy REITS if you like&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ignore what I like and buy assets you think will be best in stagflation (which we haven&amp;#39;t lived through since the 1970s).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck everyone! Never trust the fed!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
