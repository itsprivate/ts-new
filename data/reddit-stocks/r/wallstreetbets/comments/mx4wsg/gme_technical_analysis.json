Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.</p>\n\n<p>- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$</p>\n\n<p>- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!</p>\n\n<p>- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.</p>\n\n<p>- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.</p>\n\n<p>- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.</p>\n\n<p>Please have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I&#39;ve labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr 🚀 🚀 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
