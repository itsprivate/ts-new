I even bought a bit more at the midpoint prices of today. From my observations, this is how the institutions conspired to crush the longs in order to give the shorts breathing room to cover.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The beginning of the day was intentional. They let fomo run GME all the way into the sky with almost no resistance whatsoever.</p></li>\n<li><p>However, at around 10-10:30 AM EST, something odd happened. The brokers suddenly jacked up their margin requirements for GME. My portfolio previously had a lot of buying power, which suddenly disappeared.</p></li>\n<li><p>We were intentionally allowed to break 150 (which is the highest option strike available) in order to make everyone fomo even harder. Then, the dump came, and it was vicious. At the same time, CNBC started an hour-long segment bashing GME nonstop. Only Cramer provided a bit of token resistance. Every other analyst was calling this move unwarranted and warning that tons of people will be bagholding.</p></li>\n<li><p>As a result, everyone who chased in on margin got fucked. Even my sizeable portfolio was margin called. Fortunately, while I&#39;m retarded, I&#39;m not the most retarded and was not all in GME and was using only a little margin. I was able to cover easily. The unfortunate morons who fomo&#39;d in on margin above today&#39;s open were not so lucky. I imagine a lot of retards got liquidated on the way down.</p></li>\n<li><p>The cascading effect let us fill the gap completely and even a little past. However, the important point is that we closed above Friday&#39;s close at +18% for the day. I see this as very bullish. So keep holding and don&#39;t fucking sell into the fear the other side tried to create. Going forward, stop buying GME on heavy margin. Use cash accounts if possible. Don&#39;t let yourself be set up as a domino piece for the shorts to knock over into everyone else.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR: MMers, brokers, and shorts conspired to screw us. They let us run price up, then jacked up margin requirements, and finally dumped. Despite that, we defended Friday&#39;s close quite well so DON&#39;T FUCKING SELL.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
