I am seriously considering throwing my ROTH into this. We’re talking a LOT of money. I’m not a whale, god no, but I want to yeet this cash and see if it can double or triple in the next week. </p>\n\n<p>What GME shorters and my actual retard brother and everyone else is failing to understand is, we certified smooth brains on this sub can see GameStop’s FUTURE potential. We already knew GameStop was a “dying company” but fuck, we held the goddamn line and now some of you can afford a full meal at Wendy’s, and not just some fries. GameStop is due for a massive transformation, and we see it. Boomers clearly don’t, the Gay Lemon did not, but we hold and buy SHARES because we understand that this isn’t a bet on the past but faith in the future of the company. </p>\n\n<p>I have been in this army since the price hit $36.00. Now it’s at $65 or some shit like that, and I KNOW it my heart it has room to 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to atleast $100 next week. Shit, I feel in my jellies it’ll hit $120-$130 by EOW next week. </p>\n\n<p>So 💎🤚 bulls, is it time to YEET the Roth IRA all into GME, and if so, when should I buy in to help the cause? I need to see who else is standing and holding, I wanna see REAL AUTISTS rise up and tell me to hold. I believe in it, but do YOU?</p>\n\n<p>Cheers, and good luck fuckers. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>TLDR - Should I gamble entire Roth IRA for delicious tendies next week? Also, SCREECH RETARDS I wanna hear that you’re still BALLS DEEP in this bad bitch.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
