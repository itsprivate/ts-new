Originally, like 1980s, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. Now, the basket of goods can be changed rather frequently, and has been seen more as a cost of living index within the United States. As we saw in 2021 where they removed poultry and a lot of other goods from the CPI basket.\n\nHowever, if we were to plug todays numbers into the 1980s CPI formula purely looking for an output of cost of goods between two periods. We get [this](https://imgur.com/a/Dmhsqrx), note that this chart only accounts up until December 2021, the CPI has only gotten worse since then. One thing is certain, the Central Banks are dancing with an unknown fire with regards to monetary policy. The outcomes of which absolutely nobody can forecast, but it does look grim for the average consumer.\n\nOn an anecdotal point:\n\nI have a family friend that runs a small hole in the wall pizza joint in a strip mall. They are entirely family staffed by the big Italian family so don’t feel the brunt of labor shortage, more so only cost of goods increases. In 2015, their slices were priced at 2 dollars. In 2019, they increased prices to 2.50 a slice. Last month they just increased prices again to 4 dollars a slice. Obviously this is a single data point, but experience can be telling.\n\n🏳️‍🌈🐻 checking out",
