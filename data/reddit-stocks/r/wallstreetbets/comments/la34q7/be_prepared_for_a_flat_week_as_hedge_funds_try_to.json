So if I were a greedy, fraudulent bastard who would try to bankrupt a company for a few bucks and would rather risk crashing the market than take a loss, how would I deal with a hungry pack of 🦍 🦍 🦍 beating down my door for my lunch money? Well, we’ve seen them try a number of dirty tactics to try and scare us into selling. Short ladders, lying in the media that they closed their position, restricting free trading of a stock, and more. But all of these moves had one thing in common, and failed for the same reason: it showed us that they are DESPERATE for us to SELL, only confirming to us that they do in fact still hold a huge short position. </p>\n\n<p>So then what could they do to convince us that it’s over and the short squeeze won’t ever squoze? The answer is simple: nothing. Stop driving the price down, stop the FUD campaigns, just do... nothing. Let us sweat it out and speculate while the paper handed start to fold and trigger a selloff. The interest they would have to pay on their position is PENNIES compared to the difference if they can manage to close their positions in the $100s instead of the $1,000s. </p>\n\n<p>Don’t panic if the price is flat today, or all week, or even next week. It could very well be the next step in their plan. You can’t expect to make it to Mars without stopping for fuel once you break out of Earth’s atmosphere 🚀🚀🚀🚀. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR apes together strong 🚀🚀🚀🚀 —&gt; 💎💎💎💎💎 —&gt; 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
