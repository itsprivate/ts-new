If MNMD&#39;s poor up-listing performance today didn&#39;t turn you off, here is some DD that will hopefully give you a better idea of what the company does. Plenty of people seem to think that MNMD is going to be selling tabs of acid and caps of mush to folks, but that&#39;s just not it. Take a look at whats below if you&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Psych Sector Quick Overview</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the moment, there are (I think) 28 publicly traded companies in the sector. They are pretty much all penny stocks, except for Compass and Mind Med. This is a nascent sector and most likely an extended play given the time it takes for the drugs to come to market. Basically the sector can be divided into three main groups: <strong>1) Drug Developers</strong>, <strong>2) Clinic companies</strong>, and <strong>3) Recreational Companies</strong>. Many companies blend these different categories but the one we are looking at today is predominantly in the drug development space. The drugs they are working on can be classified into two distinct categories: <strong>1) Classical psychedelic compounds</strong> (Psilocybin, LSD, DMT, etc.) and <strong>2) Novel psychedelic compounds</strong> (Derivatives and Novel Formulations). MindMed is focused on developing a blend of these two. There&#39;s an incredible wealth of research that has gone into these substances and how they are presumed to be far more effective than traditional therapy options in treating a variety of psychological disorders and ailments. In fact, <strong>Ketamine is already being used</strong> in assisted therapy in many places around the world. The sector had quite the run last fall and early into the new year. Looking like there might be another run based on a couple of big-name catalysts in the coming weeks. Because of the volatility and anecdotal hype, plenty of people have likened the sector to weed. But anyone who has felt the benefits of these drugs knows it&#39;s not the same. Sure, most of the companies are going to fail, and many don&#39;t have a lot to offer at all. However, MindMed is one of the biggest names, with the biggest backers and the most expansive drug pipelines, so it&#39;s nice to think they are in a league of their own.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mind Medicine:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To get us started, their mission statement: “MindMed’s mission is to <strong>discovery, development, and deploy</strong> psychedelic inspired medicines and therapies intended to treat diseases in the areas of <strong>psychiatry</strong>, <strong>neurology</strong>, <strong>addiction</strong>, <strong>pain</strong>, and potentially others such as <strong>anxiety disorders</strong>, <strong>substance use disorders</strong> and <strong>withdrawal</strong>, and <strong>adult attention deficit disorder</strong>.”</p>\n\n<p>The company breaks its process down into three parts that I’ll preface here so that you can reference them as you read through:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Discover:</em></strong> This is where new compounds are being discovered, formulated, and tested in pre-clinical settings. Making sure things are safe and effective.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Develop:</em></strong> Where the clinical trials start-up and the big money is spent.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Deploy:</em></strong> Commercialization, distribution, scaling, access; the business side of things.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Will touch more on these different stages and what they have going on further down.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>MindMed: Financials and Company</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Drug development is crazy expensive, and MindMed has taken the opportunity many times to raise capital to finance its growth and development over the last year. Investors have complained quite a lot about it over the previous year, but it’s a reality we’re just going to have to deal with. Also, on this note, keep an eye out for up to CAD $500 million to be raised over the next two years; the base shelf prospectus has been filed and will be effective in the near future. *Sorry, I really don’t feel like doing all to currency conversions between USD and CAD.*</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Funding –</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Total Funding:</em> As of March 30, 2021, MindMed had a <strong>cash balance of $203 Million (All in CAD)</strong></li>\n<li>Tranche 2: February 18, 2020 MindMed completes second tranche for <strong>$9,227,000 CAD</strong></li>\n<li>Tranche 3: February 26, 2020 MindMed completes third tranche for <strong>$10,252,000 CAD</strong></li>\n<li>Offering 1: May 26, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal financing for <strong>$9,582,000 CAD</strong></li>\n<li>Offering 2: October 30, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal for <strong>$28,751,000 CAD</strong></li>\n<li>Offering 3: December 11, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal for <strong>$34,523,000 CAD</strong></li>\n<li>Offering 4: January 7, 2021 MindMed completes bought deal for <strong>$92,100,000 CAD</strong></li>\n<li>Offering 5: March 8, 2021 MindMed complete private financing deal for <strong>$19,500,000 CAD</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Base Shelf Prospectus:</strong> On April 9th, 2021, MindMed filed their final short form prospectus, pretty much laying out a way for them to more easily <strong><em>raise up to $500 million (CANADIAN) whenever market conditions are optimal for the next 25 months.</em></strong> <em>So be on the lookout for some pretty decent money-raising when/if the share price is looking crispy</em></p>\n\n<p>MindMed has never shied away from milking the pockets of eager investors; nor should they. The consistent interest from investors is a great sign; it&#39;s not as if people are scared of throwing their money into this company.</p>\n\n<p>MindMed <strong>burned through $24.2 million</strong> CAD in 2020. <strong>Total comprehensive loss</strong> for the year of 2020 was <strong>$35.1 million</strong> but was offset by like $8 million.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Expenses –</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>One of MindMed’s recent filings laid out how they intend to allocate their funding over the next year or two reasonably well. If you’re looking for this kind of information, you can find the MD&amp;A filing on SEDAR. They also lay out how they anticipate allocating funding from specific offerings to specific programs. It’s a lot of information, but I’m not going to include it here. Quite a few of MindMed’s acquisitions have been predominantly made via the offering of shares, so they haven’t had the same level of cash burning as some of the other emerging companies in the sector. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>55 Million Class A shares were offered for their 18-MC program</strong></li>\n<li><strong>81,833 Multiple Voting Shares</strong> (8,183,300 equivalent) were <strong>issued to acquire Health Mode</strong> (plus a cash payment of $286,000)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Fair Value of Common Shares:</em></strong> Haven’t been able to find any estimates or projections. If you know of any, just send a message, and this will be updated. The recent offering prices and warrant exercise prices might give you an idea of what investors have been willing to pay for the issued shares. Will put those below. Also, the up-listing today saw some tremendous volatility and the stock reaching all time highs.

The partnerships they have with labs for R&amp;D are reputable academic institutions that MindMed has agreed to help fund. In turn, MindMed has exclusive access to trials, data, and discoveries. The chart below is taken from their filings hopefully, it gives you a sufficient idea of what the companies structure is looking like.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9ctohyh20sv61.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a37d60137e163a5e925fffdf9f51a97049bd849f\">https://preview.redd.it/9ctohyh20sv61.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a37d60137e163a5e925fffdf9f51a97049bd849f</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>MindMed: Pipeline</strong></p>\n\n<p>MindMed has a pretty comprehensive pipeline of drugs they are developing. This pipeline has started to expand more due to their partnerships and acquisitions. Through their partnerships with labs, universities, and researchers, MindMed has exclusive licenses, including DMT, MDMA, LSD, Psilocybin. There are currently <strong>four trials going on at University Hospital Basel</strong>, and <strong>13 have already been completed</strong> giving MindMed some very valuable data to help push their approvals and research along with faster than they otherwise could have. Here’s an overview of their programs, compounds, and trials, along with their stage of development.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Discover:</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>April 2020, MindMed signed a nice <strong>exclusive collaboration deal with</strong> <strong>University Hospital Basel’s Liechti Lab</strong> (some of the most prolific psychedelic researchers). All IP, trial data, and tech that’s developed here are MindMed’s for the foreseeable future. This originally only gave them <strong>access to LSD trials</strong> and data, but they’ve since upped their game and expanded the deal to include trials and data on <strong>MDMA, DMT, MDMA-LSD (candy flipping), and Psilocybin</strong>. Any solid discoveries or advancements will be integrated into MindMed’s pipeline. For example, MindMed already gained data from an ongoing <strong>P2 LSD-Anxiety trial from UHB.</strong></li>\n<li>February 11, 2021,  <strong>MindMed announced a partnership with MindShift</strong> out of Switzerland. This partnership is <strong>focused more on developing novel psychedelic compounds</strong> to add to their pipeline. This has been a huge trend in the sector. Companies are trying to modify the compounds to be more conducive to the therapeutic process. Lots of talks have been had around <strong>taking the “trip” out of the trip</strong>. They are basically allowing people to feel <strong>the benefits without hallucinating</strong>. Their CEO said some <strong>compounds have already been identified</strong> for development, but there’s not much on what exactly these secret compounds are. However, patents have apparently been filed over these compounds, so if any of you sleuths can find them, it would be much appreciated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Develop:</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Once psychedelic compounds are identified, they’ll move onto this stage. As of now MindMed has a couple big ones in the works which you’ll be able to find more details on in the chart below. The trials of focus right now investigating 18-MC and LSD for different purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Company / Partner</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Compound</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Disorder / Purpose</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Progress / Stage</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Rights / IP / Data</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Market Competition</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed (Project Layla)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">18-MC (ibogaine derivative)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Opioid Use Disorder, Withdrawal, and Potentially Other Addictions</td>\n<td align=\"left\">P2a (Q3 2021)  P3 (<strong>at the earliest</strong> <strong>2023)</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Provisional patent filings (MindMed Assignee)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Company focused on developing other Ibogaine derivatives.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed (Project Lucy)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">LSD</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Anxiety</td>\n<td align=\"left\">P2b (Second half of 2021)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">UHB Data</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Many companies in the sector are focused on treating anxiety</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed (UHB)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Ketanserin</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Psychedelic Antagonist (The Naloxone of Psychs)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">P1 (ongoing)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed + UHB have filed a patent application preserving worldwide rights</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Benzos have been used to kill trips.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed (UHB)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">LSD</td>\n<td align=\"left\">LSD Cluster Headaches</td>\n<td align=\"left\">P2 (ongoing)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">UHB Data and Rights</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Some other headache type trials going on, but not as far along</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed (Project Flow)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">LSD</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Adult ADD</td>\n<td align=\"left\">P2a (approval granted Q3 2021)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">UHB Data and Rights</td>\n<td align=\"left\">No ongoing trials in other companies investigating this</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed</td>\n<td align=\"left\">LSD</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Microdosing (focus, creativity, mood, anxiety)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">(Starting soon)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Honestly don&#39;t know</td>\n<td align=\"left\">First ever P2a clinical trial for microdosing LSD.

However, they are the assignee of a family of patents in the US, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand for psychotherapy using <strong>3-MMC</strong>. The disorders it covers are distress, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder. A lot of other MindMed IP is being held as trade secrets for the time being, so there’s not a lot to say about it at the moment other than they are expanding their pipeline significantly.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>MindMed: Partnerships and Technology</strong></p>\n\n<p>Alright, so now that we have all the major trials and compounds pretty much covered, the third part of the MindMed process is the <strong><em>deploy</em></strong> phase. This is where their technology projects and other partnerships come into play. The chart below should give you a decent overview of the three biggest developments to come out of MindMed in this front.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Partner/Project</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Purpose</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Project Albert</td>\n<td align=\"left\">JR (CEO) has been stressing the importance of <em>Project Albert</em> for some time now. He has repeatedly emphasized that MindMed is a drug development <em>and</em> technology company. <em>Project Albert</em> is based on designing and integrating digital therapeutic tools into the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy process. They’re looking to integrate wearables, tracking, platforms, and other tools into the therapy process so that it can be more patient-personalized, effective, and informative. They’re also hoping that this part of the company improves the access people have to these medications through telemedicine.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed + HealthMode</td>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed added HealthMode to the company to expand <em>Project Albert</em>. Using AI, MindMed aims to help speed up the clinical research process and improve patient monitoring efforts. MindMed took on HealthMode’s entire team and portfolio and will begin to integrate what they have into the trails being developed as well as future patient monitoring platforms.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">NYU Langone</td>\n<td align=\"left\">MindMed is now funding a program at NYU Langone Health to train and prepare the future psychedelic researchers and psychiatrists for the future when these drugs come to market. This isn’t so much a revenue-generating project as it will benefit the sector at large by having professionals prepared to deliver these therapies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">MindShift Compounds AG</td>\n<td align=\"left\">I know I touched on this briefly earlier, but the MindShift partnership is where MindMed will gain access to second-generation psychedelic compounds. We all know about the classical psychedelic compounds (LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA, DMT, etc.); second-gen compounds are being tailored specifically for different therapeutic purposes allowing companies to engineer more effective and, in some cases, safer compounds. Tons of companies are going down this path, so it’s good to have this partnership to add to the portfolio.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully that helps some of you out and get you familiar with MNMD. Below this is information on the compounds and trials that MNMD is pursuing. If you aren&#39;t interested in a bit of science feel free to cut it off here. If you are, keep reading.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Information on Compounds and Trials :</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sections in Order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>LSD Neutralizer</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Cluster Headaches</strong></li>\n<li><strong>LSD for Adult ADHD/ADD</strong></li>\n<li><strong>LSD for Anxiety</strong></li>\n<li><strong>18-MC for Addiction</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>LSD Neutralizer</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>As I’m sure a lot of you know, LSD trips last a while. When we are looking at LSD as a compound to be used in assisted therapies, that trip duration brings up some major question marks.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Assisted therapies require trained professionals to guide the sessions. Therapy sessions aren’t cheap; the cost of therapy alone is a major barrier for many people seeking out mental health support. Couple the cost of the compounds and the specialization required for extended psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy sessions and you have a recipe for some potentially pricey treatments.</li>\n<li>LSD is not toxic to the human body. You don’t see the same type of physiological or neurotoxic potential that traditional drugs have. However, that does not mean we’re home free here. It’s important to recognize that LSD does have some potential health harms that we should all be aware of. Improper use can lead to potential physical harm. Bad trips can lead to emotional distress. If you don’t screen for underlying psychological conditions like psychosis and schizophrenia some people can experience serious cognitive harms.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This neutralizer technology is purported to act as an off switch for LSD trips. Quick pill and a little while later the trip is over. This funky little compound is called <strong>Ketanserin</strong> and it’s a major part of dealing with the two issues I mentioned above. If you’re able to control and attenuate the trip, you’re able to reduce the time needed to conduct the therapy session. This can reduce costs related to therapy  making it more affordable for a greater number of people. In theory, it could also allow people to take higher single doses, should the therapy demand it, and have the effects neutralized when needed.</p>\n\n<p>Now onto the harms… Luckily for all of us, the harms mentioned above can be managed/mitigated. Proper psychological screening can work out issues related to underlying conditions. Managing set and setting helps reduce the potential for harms related to improper use like stupid behavior and bad trips. This LSD neutralizer is just another great tool in the therapist&#39;s tool belt that can be used to mitigate harm during therapy. Being able to stop the experience allows for a failsafe on the therapy sessions which ensures that no one comes out of it worse than they went in. As an add-value, this compound could be sold to recreational users (in theory) to ensure safe at-home use and could also be used in ER departments where occasionally, I&#39;m sure some people come in experiencing bad trips.</p>\n\n<p>Cool beans, so how does it work? Well, let me use a quick analogy to get the ball rolling.</p>\n\n<p>We are all aware of opioids and how people can easily overdose on them. Guaranteed many of you have also heard of Naloxone, the antidote for an opioid overdose. Think of Kertanserin as you would think of Naloxone.</p>\n\n<p>Naloxone and Kertanserin are both antagonists that act against the effects of their respective counterparts. Opioids produce their effects by interacting with the four opioid receptors we all have in our brains. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that works by binding to those receptors and knocking the opioids off of the receptors for a duration of time; allowing for people to seek the additional help that they need. <a href=\"https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/understanding-naloxone/\">Source here</a> (If you’re in Canada, go to the pharmacy and get a free Naloxone kit.. you could save a life)</p>\n\n<p>This brings us to Kertanserin and LSD. The psychedelic effects of LSD have been theorized to produce their effects through partial serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism. (Agonism being the opposite of Antagonism) Kertanserin works as an antagonist to the same receptor, allowing for the effects of LSD to be attenuated. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-017-4610-0\">Here is a study</a> that substantiates the claim that Kertanserin fully blocks the subjective effects of LSD. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.030\">Here is another one</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Cluster Headaches</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, you get headaches, but do you get cluster headaches? I sure hope not. If you do, oh boy does MNMD have the treatment for you. Cluster headaches multiple short, debilitating headaches that can occur repeatedly for expended durations of time. Cluster headaches can go away for a while and then spring back up on you years later. They don’t affect many people <a href=\"https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/188/3/217.3.full.pdf\">(~0.1%)</a> and there isn’t a lot of information out there on what causes them. Regardless, they are painful and people shouldn’t have to deal with it if they don’t have to.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional treatments for cluster headaches include oxygen and sumatriptan for single attacks; and verapamil, lithium, corticosteroids, and more for cluster <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0333102410363490\">attack periods.</a> However, anecdotal evidence has suggested that LSD and Psilocybin are both more effective in dealing with individual attacks and attack periods.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ck-wissen.de/ckwiki/images/1/14/IHS_IHC_2009_BOL_Halpern.pdf\">One study</a> using a non-hallucinogenic analog of LSD, 2-Bromo-LSD (BOL), found that three single doses of BOL can either break a series of cluster headache attacks or reduce their frequency and intensity. Furthermore, for some, BOL allowed them to achieve remission from their previous chronic cluster headaches. No adverse outcomes were observed in the study. The interesting thing about this study is that the researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of action is unrelated to the serotonin receptor agonism that scientists are theorizing is responsible for hallucinations. This means that it isn’t so much about the hallucinations, but something else that these beautiful compounds have in store. They theorize that the positive effects are the result of serotonin-receptor-mediated <em>vasoconstriction</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13311-020-00962-y\">A very recent 2020</a> study backs this up when evaluating the migraine suppressing effects of Psilocybin. The study found that ONE SMALL SINGLE DOSE of shroomies magic chemical, psilocybin, was far more effective than traditional treatments in dealing with migraines. Furthermore, the suppressing effects of the psilocybin on migraines were sustained over two weeks. Again, this study backs up the previous claim that the effects are independent of the hallucinogenic properties of the drugs.</p>\n\n<p>The current phase 2 study going on at UHB in Switzerland <a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03781128?term=LSD&amp;cond=Cluster+Headache&amp;draw=1&amp;rank=1\">can be found here!</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>LSD – For Adult ADHD</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Stimulants suck for a lot of people who had ADD/ADHD. They often kill your sex drive, they make you irritable, and they sometimes make you lose weight among many other things. Having a viable alternative is something many of us have dreamed of for a long while. I guarantee you’ve all heard the stories of Silicon Valley execs micro-dosing LSD to improve their productivity and creativity. Well, it looks like our ex-silicon valley CEO now wants to lay down some hard science on this practice.</p>\n\n<p>So what does the anecdotal evidence say?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02791072.2020.1761573?casa_token=FGgn9elCDA4AAAAA:P3_F-W3CDq-kHsfupA86zgGYB-guSujfCYtu-F3yHZ1IZOeYvNs3M9uwdWrt_HkQvEIqD4aPYtRW\">Study 1</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>General effects have been described as “a really good day”.</li>\n<li>80% of people surveyed reported a positive or neutral experience.</li>\n<li>The most common reason for stopping the micro-dosing regime was that people felt the practice was ineffectual.</li>\n<li>Many patients reported positive impacts on depression and anxiety.</li>\n<li>Some patients felt that micro-dosing long-term exacerbated their mental health issues.*</li>\n<li>69% person of surveyed college students who micro-dosed reported at least one negative side effects from the practice. The most common negative side effect was hallucinations (44.2%). (Maybe from inaccurate dosages?)</li>\n<li>One other very common concern was the legality of the practice. (Gotta hate those stupid laws)</li>\n<li>Multiple studies reported that people consistently felt great improvements in creativity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02791072.2019.1593561\">Study 2</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Many patients reported that they wanted to microdose for their diagnosed ADHD/self-diagnosed attention issues.</li>\n<li>Most surveyed reported productivity increases and that they procrastinated less.*</li>\n<li>This study proposes that despite LSD and Psilocybin acting on different neuroreceptors than traditional stimulants, that their effects could be positives because they are still stimulating drugs.*</li>\n<li>A substantial amount those surveyed reported substituting micro-dosing for their stimulants.</li>\n<li>Participants reported improvements in home life including a more giving, patient, and open attitude with family members.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00672/full\">Study 3</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The most prevalent mental disorder diagnoses in this study were depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and ADHD/ADD.</li>\n<li>Microdosing was rated more effective than traditional treatment options for ADHD/ADD.</li>\n<li>The study theorized that micro-dosing is often preferred because it doesn’t come with as many negative side effects.</li>\n<li>Specifically for ADHD, micro-dosing did not come with the same crash that stimulants did.</li>\n<li>An additional advantage was that there was not a need to microdose daily.

There is a lot to it, but you can sift through the section titles quickly. I would recommend reading Question 5, 6, 7, and 8. (Page 1043-1046)</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately there isn’t much clinical evidence to back this one up. I’m glad MMED is taking the steps needed to address this gap in the literature. It will for sure be one that I am paying attention to. Consistent themes in the studies included some negative effects related to dosage. I think that a clinically dosed regime would resolve a lot of these issues especially if a determined dosage scale based on body weight, metabolism, and other factors was developed. However, one major concern I have is that there is anecdotal evidence of microdosing exacerabting underlying mental health issues.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>LSD – For Anxiety</strong></p>\n\n<p>A lot of the current focus in terms of LSD and anxiety has been its use in palliative care. People who are faced with some pretty scary diseases have reported some great improvements in their condition after psychedelic experiences. Anxiety is a very very broad category of diagnosis. I won’t be able to cover them all here but I will list the 12 broad diagnosis possibilities the DSM-V gives us. The ones I focused my research on are bold.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Separation Anxiety Disorder</li>\n<li>Selective Mutism</li>\n<li>Specific Phobia</li>\n<li>Social Anxiety Disorder</li>\n<li>Panic Attack</li>\n<li>Agoraphobia</li>\n<li><strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</strong></li>\n<li>Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder</li>\n<li><strong>Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition</strong></li>\n<li>Other Specified Anxiety Disorder</li>\n<li>Unspecified Anxiety Disorder</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881114555249?casa_token=J8Q8H2JouXYAAAAA:95_8VljUYfbiwXvmRWPb50WxwavksJhfR26xxtf8mSS1GIHYTDxR_V2rENfuYS5KOR1iHxilvy22\"><strong><em>Study 1</em></strong></a><strong><em>: LSD-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated with a Life-Threatening Disease</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>This study interviewed 10 participants who had undergone LSD-assisted psychotherapy to assist in dealing with their palliative-related anxiety. After 12 months the patients were interviewed and none of them reported any lasting adverse reactions or effects. 77.8% of patients reported a reduction in anxiety and 66.7% reported a rise in quality of life.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in reading about the first-hand accounts I would recommend reading more into this particular quallatative study. Some of the effects and stories are very profound.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201786\"><strong><em>Study 2</em></strong></a><strong><em>: Modern Clinical Research on LSD (Very Comprehensive)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Mechanism of Action: (For the Science People)</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>LSD potently binds to serotonin 5-HT receptors (1a, 2a, 2c), dopamine d2 receptor, and a2 adrenergic receptor.</li>\n<li>The hallucinogenic effects are mediated by the drugs affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. This has been proven due to the ability to block these subjective effects using an antagonist (See the LSD Neutralizer).</li>\n<li>The full scope of the mechanisms of actions has not been fully identified. However, one key mechanism is the activation of frontal cortex glutamate transmission.</li>\n<li>LSD binds more potently to 5-HT2A receptors than does psilocybin.</li>\n<li>Unlike other serotonergic hallucinogens, LSD binds to adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In humans, LSD may enhance dopamine neurotransmission. (COOL)</li>\n<li>LSD increases functional connectivity between various brain regions. (COOL)</li>\n<li>Functional brain imaging showed more globally synchronized activity within the brain and a reduction of network separation while under the pharmacological effects of LSD.</li>\n<li>LSD decreased default mode network integrity.</li>\n<li>LSD reduced left amygdala reactivity to the presentation of fearful faces. (COOL)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Adverse Effects:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and pupil side.</li>\n<li>Adverse effects 10-24 hours after administration include difficult concentration, headaches, dizziness, lack of appetite, dry mouth, nausea, imbalance, and exhaustion.</li>\n<li>No severe side effects have been found and it is physically non-toxic.</li>\n<li>Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a rare disorder stemming from psychedelic use. Occurs almost exclusively in illicit use or patients with underlying cognitive predispositions <strong>like anxiety</strong>. (Uh oh)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Effects on Patients:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Profound anxiety or panic was not experienced by patients of one study.</li>\n<li>LSD mainly induced blissful states, audiovisual synesthesia, changes in the meaning of perceptions, and positively experiences derealization and depersonalization.</li>\n<li>At 200 micrograms, LSD acutely induced mystical experiences in patients undergoing psychotherapy. This is important because previous studies with psilocybin have shown that mystical experiences are correlated with improvements in mood and personality and <strong>better therapeutic outcomes in patients with anxiety</strong>, depression, and substance use disorders.</li>\n<li>Music has been used to produce greater feelings of transcendence and wonder in patients.</li>\n<li>LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces and enhanced emotional empathy.</li>\n<li>LSD produced moderate ego dissolution.</li>\n<li>LSD produced lower fear perception which may be useful in psychotherapy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Mid/Long Term Effects:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The use of classical psychedelics is associated with lower psychological distress, lower suicidality, and lower mental health problems.</li>\n<li>LSD in healthy subjects increase optimism and trait openness 2 weeks after administration and produced trends towards decreases in distress and delusional thinking.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There isn’t a ton of research on LSD for treating anxiety out there right now. You’re far more likely to find literature on psilocybin. This could be for a variety of reasons but regardless it is fantastic that MMED is again, researching to fill the gaps here. My biggest takeaways here are that LSD is showing some significant promise concerning treating anxiety. The effects that it has on the human brain make it a fantastic candidate for integration into therapy sessions. However, something that is often overlooked is the importance of the role of the therapist. I’ll have to look harder into what MMED is doing to develop therapeutic processes but like <a href=\"https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1454576/FULLTEXT01.pdf\">Study 3</a> iterated, the relationship between the therapist and patient is imperative. Additionally, the patient needs to be equipped to deal with any adverse outcomes or reactions that could arise throughout the treatment. I think this part in particular bodes well for MMED since the LSD neutralizer is a fantastic way to ensure safety throughout the entire therapeutic process.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>18-MC – For Addiction</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ahhh 18-MC, MMED’s promise child… Addiction is a bitch, there’s no doubt about that. The toll it has and continues to have on the world is horrible. Opioid overdoses are consistently increasing, alcohol dependence continues to destroy families and lives and cocaine abuse is no joke.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf\">STATS</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>52 million people currently use opioids.</li>\n<li>Opioids are responsible for ~2/3 substance abuse-related deaths.</li>\n<li>11 million people inject some form of opioid on a daily basis.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I could list all the addictions in the world but I’m sure you get the picture. It’s a serious issue, one that MMED seeks to resolve with 18-MC.</p>\n\n<p>Before we look at 18-MC we have to talk about Ibogaine. <a href=\"https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf\">This study</a> gives a great overview of Ibogaine but I’ll give you the summary here. Ibogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid that is found within the <em>Tabernanthe iboga</em> plant in West Africa. The plants&#39; root bark can be consumed in both refined and crude forms, and in high doses can produce trance-like states with visual and auditory hallucinations. Ibogaine has been theorized as an effective natural treatment of substance use disorders.</p>\n\n<p>How Ibogaine works on the human body and mind is still speculative. Ibogaine serves as an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist. This particular receptor is a molecular target for several abused drugs. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816684/#:%7E:text=Glutamate%20plays%20a%20pivotal%20role,for%20several%20drugs%20of%20abuse.&amp;text=These%20ligands%20include%20the%20NMDA,partial%20NMDA%20agonist%20d%2DCycloserine.\">A previous study</a> on NMDA receptor modulators found that agonism of these receptors has some limited benefit in treating drug addiction. However, without further study, the way it produces its anti-addictive effects are still in question. For all the science buffs out there, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077262\">this study</a> rules out one other mechanism of action of Iboga Alkaloids.</p>\n\n<p>Ibogaine has previously been investigated as <a href=\"https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf\">a treatment for opioid use disorder</a>. A study in 1999 focused on ibogaine in the opioid detoxification process. Patients were treated using different doses of ibogaine based on bodyweight. 76% of the participants did not experience opioid withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours. Furthermore, they did not seek out their substances of choice for the three days they were under observation post-treatment. Another 12% of the patients did not experience withdrawal symptoms but still decided to resume drug abuse.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf\">Another study</a> on individuals who sought out treatment for their opioid use disorder found that after 12 months, 75% of participating patients tested negative for opioid use. To back this up, a later study found that one month after treatment, 50% of patients reported no opioid use for the following 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this promise, Ibogaine has the potential to be a dangerous compound. There have been 19 documented fatalities from Ibogaine, one of which was under medical supervision. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Szumlinski/publication/227933445_Glick_SD_Maisonneuve_IM_Szumlinski_KK_18-Methoxycoronaridine_18-MC_and_ibogaine_comparison_of_antiaddictive_efficacy_toxicity_and_mechanisms_of_action_Ann_N_Y_Acad_Sci_914_369-386/links/5dfa3722a6fdcc28372907e6/Glick-SD-Maisonneuve-IM-Szumlinski-KK-18-Methoxycoronaridine-18-MC-and-ibogaine-comparison-of-antiaddictive-efficacy-toxicity-and-mechanisms-of-action-Ann-N-Y-Acad-Sci-914-369-386.pdf\">Ibogaine induces body tremors</a> at moderate doses. In high doses, Ibogaine is neurotoxic. Ibogaine also has the potential to decrease the human heart rate and impact blood pressure. These possible dangers served as the impetus of <strong>Stanley Glick (Big Stud)</strong> and colleagues to try and produce a safer synthetic iboga derivative. 18-MC is born</p>\n\n<p>Since 18-MC and Ibogaine are so closely related I’m going to pull from some more recent studies on both of them to give insight into the efficacy of these drugs on addiction.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00952990.2017.1320802\">This study</a> found that the clinical effects of ibogaine on opioid withdrawal symptoms appeared to be comparable to those of methadone. In this particular study, 50% of patients reported no opioid use during the previous 30 days, 1-month post-treatment, and 33% reported no use in the previous 30 days at the 3-month mark. These rates of reduction in use were greater than those who had been treated with buprenorphine. Drug use scores were improved relative to pre-treatments and were (moderately) sustained over 12-months.</p>\n\n<p>In one of Glick’s <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Szumlinski/publication/227933445_Glick_SD_Maisonneuve_IM_Szumlinski_KK_18-Methoxycoronaridine_18-MC_and_ibogaine_comparison_of_antiaddictive_efficacy_toxicity_and_mechanisms_of_action_Ann_N_Y_Acad_Sci_914_369-386/links/5dfa3722a6fdcc28372907e6/Glick-SD-Maisonneuve-IM-Szumlinski-KK-18-Methoxycoronaridine-18-MC-and-ibogaine-comparison-of-antiaddictive-efficacy-toxicity-and-mechanisms-of-action-Ann-N-Y-Acad-Sci-914-369-386.pdf\">early studies</a> on 18-MC in rats, he and his colleagues found that it shared all the purported anti-addictive effects of Ibogaine. The advantage of 18-MC is that it is theorized to <strong>not have the same hallucinogenic activity as Ibogaine</strong> since it does not bind to serotonin receptors. Furthermore, it is <strong>less toxic than Ibogaine both physiologically and neurologically</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It is theorized that 18-MC will be able to assist in dealing with more than opioids, however. Alcohol, amphetamines, and cocaine have all been mentioned as possible substances of abuse that can be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>One important thing to take out of all of this is that one of the studies found that abstinence from drug abuse lowered over time. This means that there is a potential for repeat treatments over time. Despite this, the frequency in which this would have to occur appears to be significantly less than current alternatives like methadone treatment.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - Mind Medicine is developing drugs to treat all your mental health needs. They have the biggest and best pipeline out of any publicly traded psychedelic stock, they are the farthest along overall in terms of aggregate trial progress, and they have emerging compounds that are going to be put into trials starting soon. The CEO loves the idea of integrating tech into the space so theres more than just drugs to get excited about. Revenue is far out but money making opportunities are not.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
