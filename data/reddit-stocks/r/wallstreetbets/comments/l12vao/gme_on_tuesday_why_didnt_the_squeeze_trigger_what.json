At this point, we can see that there are barely any shares left for them to short.</li>\n<li>Paper-handed autists who panicked-sold when they bought in at 43-34 and saw it drop to 38 without understanding it was going to happen due to the shorts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>They <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/MMb3i5n.png\">timed their tweet and simultaneously shorted close to 2.2m shares</a> but people were relentless in buying them all up. As we can see, the trackers eventually stopped tracking the shares available to short, as it went from a million down to <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/773545837212598284/801303927215226901/dq6ajcxm7bc61.png\">8,000 to 7,000 bouncing back up to 100,000</a> before it went radio silent.</p>\n\n<p>​</p>\n\n<p>Yet even with their efforts, people still bought and they barely tanked the stock price at all. It even tested the 42 price limit once again just prior to power hour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did those 100,000 shares get freed up?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, you got it, paper-hands who are selling their shares &amp; refilling the shorts&#39; ammo.</p>\n\n<p>Also brokers who borrow shares from people&#39;s account on opting to pay them interest for the melvins &amp; citrons to short (please explicitly call your broker to say you do not want them lending shares out)</p>\n\n<p>They are done, unless there is a mass exodus of people who sell their shares(we can clearly see that&#39;s not the case, any dip is immediately bought up and we go right back to challenging any price limits of 41, 42, 44) ; the interest rates for them to borrow shares to continue to short their positions will eventually kill them. We are already at 57% interest over the weekend, we are so very close.</p>\n\n<p>​</p>\n\n<p>For the squeeze to occur, many people must understand what is actually going on.</p>\n\n<p>​</p>\n\n<p>If you do not, then seeing it fall from 43 to 38 in a couple of hours will definitely scare you. But there&#39;s a reason why we call it diamond-handing, because none of these actually matters. There will still be dips, there will be always people paper-handing their shares but once it squeezes, it will be glorious. There are people who got in over a year ago and have made millions who will not let go, because they fully grasp the situation.</p>\n\n<p>​</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t let your heart rule over the sensible minds who know this inside out for a year or 2 in this one, because if you are afraid the squeeze is not coming and decide to sell your shares, just know that the same way it gets continuously bought up at 38,39 there will be people who still go in.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>tl;dr:</strong></h2>\n\n<h2><strong>1. BUY SHARES WITH CASH. TURN OFF SHARE BORROWING.</strong></h2>\n\n<h2><strong>2. STOP PAPER HANDING GME!! DIAMOND HAND ALL THE WAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</strong></h2>\n\n<h2><strong>3. BUY SHARES WITH CASH. TURN OFF SHARE BORROWING.</strong></h2>\n\n<p><em>credits to <a href=\"/u/pinholeandwheels\">/u/pinholeandwheels</a></em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
