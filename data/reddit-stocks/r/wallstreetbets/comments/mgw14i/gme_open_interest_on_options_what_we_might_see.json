It looks like there are some major pain points on both sides depending on where it ends up Thursday:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9wu99jv3v9q61.png?width=323&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cb708a31a5ea9544267dc993c22fdc999a60c2d\">https://preview.redd.it/9wu99jv3v9q61.png?width=323&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cb708a31a5ea9544267dc993c22fdc999a60c2d</a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, it looks like $169 is the break even where there is the same amount of open interest. At the $220 mark we see a pretty massive shift, and at $250 puts are almost completely wiped out. If I were a hedge fund with lots of puts, I would be saving all my ammo for Thursday to get this down below $169.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/upr3l4u5w9q61.png?width=313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21ccaf6c7119b9772a5059e14bc523a1613592ca\">https://preview.redd.it/upr3l4u5w9q61.png?width=313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21ccaf6c7119b9772a5059e14bc523a1613592ca</a></p>\n\n<p>It also looks like we might see some major pressure around the $250 mark, as that could really spice things up if we ended $250+ by eod Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Bears need $170 or below by EOW to gain the upperhand leading into next week. If it ends ~$180-$190, good chance we don&#39;t see too much of a change next week, maybe a bit of downward pressure. If we hit $250 by EOW, we <strong>might</strong> see something big happen.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: If you think this is a GME TO THE MOON THURSDAY post because of open interest I don&#39;t think you read it right. I am just expressing where I see a majority of the options rest and where  I think we might see a lot of action occur/what it might mean for next week (@ $170, $220 and $250). I&#39;ve got 63 @ 151 avg, and just trying to figure out what sort of plan I have for buying, as holding is not sufficient for increasing my blood pressure.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
