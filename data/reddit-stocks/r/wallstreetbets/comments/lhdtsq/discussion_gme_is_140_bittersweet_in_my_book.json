Without the 💎👐,  Melvin Capital &amp; Citadel would have spewed enough propaganda via Jim Cramer and the rest of CNBC&#39;s GREEDY Citadel&#39;s deep pocketed-lined talking heads swaying via Citadel&#39;s bribes / donations to their &quot;expert&quot; anchors, analysts, supreme &quot;analyzed&quot; research. The average stubborn, impossible boomer will <em>follow</em> exactly.what they see on CNBC and affiliated &quot;researched reports&quot; along with their strategic plays. </p>\n\n<p><strong>CERTAIN</strong> Manipulating Hedge funds (Melvin Capital and Citadel) always buy low, hype it via CNBC through the faces of their puppets and sell the highest when it makes enough profits for them to slowly start shares causing minimal peaking while staying under the radar.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t forget how much these scumbags made off the market crashes from 2008 thru 2009. </p>\n\n<p>Hey Melvin, I&#39;m sorry to hear that you weren&#39;t able to get GameStop cheap enough to cover you shorts. Citadel, I&#39;m sorry you wasted all of that sweet sweet bailout money you gave to Melvin Capital to just have the temporary bandages blown off and now it will be even more painless when you swing right through strike 2. you may have had the boomers fooled with your fake news,. Citadel, but us diamond hands knew better.. we started a family,  very close tight-knit family who depending on each and others&#39;s ginormous balls and heart-felt promises to connectings of OUR FAMILY!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>DON&#39;T FUCK WITH MY FAMILY MOTHER FUCKERS!</strong> </p>\n\n<p>These 💎 👐 are not going away, we love playing &quot;Guess how much Melvin lost today?&quot; You greedy fucks deserve to lose fair and square as us retail traders do not have the same advantage to produce sudden &quot;glitches&quot; with your Robinhood exchange puppets, your &quot;Sell GME and hurry to silver before you miss out on the NEXT BIG THING.. </p>\n\n<p>Grosses part, the FUCKING TREASURER OF THE FUCKING UNITED FUCKING STATES HAD PUBLICLY ACCEPTED ALMOST $1,000,000, YES, ALMOST ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN &quot;DONATIONS&quot; FROM CITADEL TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE VOLATILITY OF &quot;CERTAIN&quot; YET-UNNAMED STOCKS THAT MELVIN CAPITAL WAS LOSING BILLIONS IN THEIR RIDICULOUS SHORTS COVERING MORE THAN 100% OF A STOCK. SINCE WHEN THE FUCK CAN YOU OWN MORE THAN 100% OF A COMPANY? HOW IS THAT LEGAL TO BET SHORTS AT 122%,.140% -- WHERE&#39;S THESE COUNTERFEIT STOCKS???</p>\n\n<p>OH RIGHT!! MELVIN CAPITAL CAN JUST KEEP ISSIING FAILURE TO DELIVERS (FD&#39;S) AND PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY ARE RECEIVING THEIR SHARES, WHEN IN FACT, THEY ARE IOU&#39;s!!! And they just play the victim of &quot;oh there was a glitch, and this happened, blah blah blah) SEC and FINRA slap them on the wrist, during their luncheon at their offices. </p>\n\n<p>THE SEC AND FINRA ARE TRU COWARDS IF THEY DO NOT FOLLOW TJR WITH THE BLATANT MARKET MANIPULATION FROM - The Kingping &quot;Citadel&quot; , The Fat Greedy Bastard (Melvin Capital) and The Puppets (Robinhood)</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t like her stock<em>ings</em> anymore, we are married now 😉</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
