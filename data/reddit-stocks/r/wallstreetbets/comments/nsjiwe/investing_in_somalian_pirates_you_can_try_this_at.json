Everyone laughed at me and told me to eat rocks. Everyone fuckin laughed. Until now:</p>\n\n<h1>Part 1: DD</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/btzzb4qncc371.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cc1bb02a4c4daf006350c0c235c052dc94a461c\">Pirate attacks per year are at an ALL TIME LOW.</a></p>\n\n<p>I instantly realized after seeing this that big business and the government don&#39;t consider pirates real threats anymore. There are cargo ships parked all over the damn place just waiting for a pirate with the RPG I bought him to take. This was my first confirmation bias. Which is why I knew I had to find a way to buy in.</p>\n\n<p>I then turned to the only place I knew that could help me find out more about how to invest in the next Benjamin Hornigold:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u4xewo0kcc371.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fad1d5fbaa6ca2099a6d50937bfbc01ba806dcb7\">https://preview.redd.it/u4xewo0kcc371.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fad1d5fbaa6ca2099a6d50937bfbc01ba806dcb7</a></p>\n\n<p>It didn&#39;t work. However, after a few more days of digging around googling autistic keywords, I found it:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j1s27bfgcc371.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce27a12461fd6e8263a54401e0a629de4988afec\">https://preview.redd.it/j1s27bfgcc371.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce27a12461fd6e8263a54401e0a629de4988afec</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aopgdopecc371.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f70c98f6e552c9a81de03ae10b5485669988aa1b\">Found my Hornigold</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bingo.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer before I go any further: You might be thinking to yourself, &quot;wow what a prick. Who would invest and give guns to people who you pretty much know are going to use them on other humans? What kind of sick person would do such a thing?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>To that I say 1) fuck off and 2) this is <strong>GOOD FOR THE ENVIROMENT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nc8s2jg6dc371.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80b4da050cd95ecfd3e0459f093066921744dd77\">https://preview.redd.it/nc8s2jg6dc371.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80b4da050cd95ecfd3e0459f093066921744dd77</a></p>\n\n<p>So - with the ethics/DD taken care of, I began my Journey to find a way to get some pirates invested in.</p>\n\n<h1>Part 2: Actually finding the pirate stonk exchange</h1>\n\n<p>Not gonna lie - this was a pain in the ass. Turns out, the only way to actually invest in pirates is to give them the money/guns physically. My Wendy&#39;s check didn&#39;t give me enough for an air plane ticket and to invest so instead I decided to just buy the RPGs and send em out to them.</p>\n\n<p>I got in contact with a guy who called himself &#39;3 leg&#39; off a site im pretty sure I cant post on here and sent him an email asking if they had any stock I could buy in their pirate crew (and how many shares I would get for sending over an RPG).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/avrh9es0dc371.png?width=1315&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1fb8cd5800eb0d5c1e74bee8e67ee67b63504d0\">I made sure to translate it into somali too.</a></p>\n\n<p>After some time he got back to me:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5sv6nkg3dc371.png?width=243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5e5529d89f8215bfed1b2f8e04dbce431f50acc\">https://preview.redd.it/5sv6nkg3dc371.png?width=243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5e5529d89f8215bfed1b2f8e04dbce431f50acc</a></p>\n\n<p>So, I bought 3 RPG-7&#39;s from places unknown and sent them off to Jowlo Road.</p>\n\n<p>It has currently been about 5 months now since I sent the original 3 RPG&#39;s. The only contact I have received from 3 leg was some weird email in Somali:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i0g092xscc371.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1880a30b80699440fa858277425616c9229bfad5\">https://preview.redd.it/i0g092xscc371.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1880a30b80699440fa858277425616c9229bfad5</a></p>\n\n<h1>Part 3: Current Day</h1>\n\n<p>So here we are, almost 6 months down the line - no money left in my bank account and no word from 3 leg. I&#39;m starting to think something might have happened to them while they were out at sea and am worried. 3 leg, from what I knew, was a pretty stand up guy. He replied fast to my emails and was quick to send me an address. It makes me think the RPG&#39;s might not have been enough. I am saving up currently to make a trip out to Hardaheere (the town he lives in) to make sure they are okay and to hopefully find the tendieman too. Will report back if I make any headway.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: 1 share GME, 1 FIS JAN 2022 210c, 3 RPG-7 military grade unmarked, 46 RPG-7 ammunition</p>\n\n<p>Obligatory Rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>P.S when is paper trading competition? out of $$$</p>\n\n<p>Edit: wow this blew up, butt pirates bouta be loaded.
