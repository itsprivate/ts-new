Large scale data mining can find trends for rising stonks on this sub before we even can. The hedgefunds are paying ridiculous amounts of money for developers to make it so that retail investors continue to have less power and access to less information than them.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, we have enough programmers on this sub we could (and should) get an open source competing team going to democratize this information. I&#39;m looking into it now, but unfortunately I have very little experience data mining/analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Reworded a sentence for clarity, missed the ninja edit grace period by a smidge</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Within 30 minutes of posting this, I have enough offers for help to get this started. I&#39;ve never contributed to an open source project before much less owned one, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be in good hands. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/claireballoon/wallstreetbets\">I&#39;ve gone ahead and made a repo for you to follow, although nothing exists yet.</a> I humbly ask that you not overwhelm me as I&#39;m figuring all this out. I&#39;m getting a discord organized first, feel free to DM me with your background and a request to be added. Once there&#39;s at least some form of moderation in place for that, I&#39;ll post that publicly and we can all go from there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> Changed the imgur link to be one uploaded anonymously for privacy concerns, the images themselves have not been changed. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you to the 100+ people who have DM&#39;d me with offers for help--it will take me a long time to be able to sort through all of these. Please stay patient. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4:  If possible, please send me a reddit DM rather than a chat.</strong> For some reason, I am no longer able to send chats. Not sure if I&#39;m being rate limited or just a bug.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has shared similar projects that already exist. After I finish adding all interested collaborators, the next steps will be brainstorming and identifying what our objectives are--what we want to accomplish, what is reasonable, what our goals are. This will include incorporating or collaborating with what already exists.</p>\n\n<p>For the skeptics out there--I understand your doubts, but I am endeavoring to do whatever I can with the momentum this post has gotten. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong> If you have legal experience and/or are a lawyer that can help us make sure we&#39;re not breaking the law, we need that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 7:</strong> I am still going through the DMs to those who have already sent them. For those now seeing this post please fill out this <a href=\"https://forms.gle/kq9LdjagEhoDz4X5A\">google form</a> rather than sending me a DM.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
