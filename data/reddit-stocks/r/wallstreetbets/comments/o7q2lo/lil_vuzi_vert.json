Vuzix is a crazy fucking eyewear company that are essentially the future of manufacturing and surgical tools. Now, why is this important? Google tried to do this shit like 8 years ago and nobody cared, right? Yes, that's correct. There’s one other thing that's correct too. Google's attempt absolutely sucked and they did not pursue improving their product. Vuzix remains on the leading edge of smart eyeglass technology with over 146 patents. So, it’s too late google, you already lost this one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/czqvyeqgjf771.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc7fcc46d770489304b2090036d56895d0e230d4\n\n \n\nAnyway since I took one semester of an entry level laser course in college, I’m going to explain this technology to you. The waveguide technology employed by vuzix deliver high quality, full color images directly to your fucking eyeball. Now, these images are completely transparent so it allows the user to still interact with natural reality. This differs from other products, which deliver a useless opaque image.\n\nNow how can this help with surgery? Do you remember when Tony Stark goes into repair mode while in the iron man suit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vyrb1kyjjf771.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8fcee5ffcd29dc9d6fec61a83031e0094ef534b\n\n Yeah, that’s what these glasses do. They can provide a whole digital map of whichever part of the body they are working on. That’s not all. They can also provide a live video stream with an augmented reality presence in order to assist surgical techs in helping their surgeon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjujg42njf771.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&s=622d7f16edb9c84a3d8224121077358f89714a02\n\n Now that I've showed you some of Vuzix's tech lets take a look at the third graders their up against:\n\n* **Thirdeye Gen** \\- really cool name, where’d they get that at? *Hot Topic??* Anyway, this company doesn’t hold a candle to Vuzix. They aren’t even attempting to use this crap in surgical applications yet, but they do have some implementations in healthcare by basically doing the same thing a tablet can do. This can also be said for their manufacturing applications as well. Plus, just look at these things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bh6vfbhxjf771.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ebd116fe95f02e689942efd6209343ca8fc47b0\n\n \n\n* **Microvision** \\- Need I say more\n* **Vrteek** \\- Mainly just focused on virtual tours and videos. That’s cool, stay in your fucking lane.\n* **Manus VR -** this is actually a really cool company, but their applications are more focused on digital production applications. This wouldn’t necessarily be a competitor at this time but since its along the same lines it should be mentioned\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Time to look at some numbers for you viewers with more then 10 brain cells:**\n\nIn 2020 Vuzix experienced very rapid growth. This can be attributed to technology finally catching up to the product as well as a lot of new big orders from reputable companies. In 2021 Vuzix saw sales increase 2.4 million dollars, or 177% year over year!!\n\n* Data interpreted from Vuzix website show Quarter 1 2021 results at a 49% improvement year over year.\n* Sales of their products show an improvement of 2,383,000 year over year as well..\n\n**So , expenses.**\n\n* Vuzix operating expenses reported in Q1 of 2021 were reported to be $7,654,000. Yes, these rose compared to the same quarter last year where operating expenses were $5,339,000. Obviously this is related to increased production.\n\n**What does this look like per share?**\n\n* Vuzix reported net loss per share of -$.12. Year over year, this is a -$.06 improvement.\n* Vuzix is becoming more efficient. With increased sales and lower operating costs this company is pushing towards positive cash flow in the coming quarters.\n\n**See below from vuzix website**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wts336nakf771.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=f938b9b99f88a7282aae023c248e3a89c6c967af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39ccipnckf771.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=303d20bd25405d58fe71a1b2da2a414a761d6105\n\n \n\nI want to talk about this stock over the past few months. Vuzix saw an amazing run up in their stock price following both their quarter 4 2020 results as well as the q1 2021 results. Following q1 2020 the stock price rose an incredible 443% to an at the time high of $23.59. Q1 2021 results brought a slight dip in the stock price followed by another run-up of 30% to an all time high of $30.57. Sounds like some real fomo territory right? Following this impressive all time high this stock has seen a decrease of 43%. It now sits at $17.48 per share. A bit of a drop from its ATH (aqua teen hunger...force).\n\nA drop in this territory is completely natural for a growing company. During a press release on March 26 Vuzix announced that they were offering 4.1 million shares of its common stock at $20.50 a share (compared to the stock price of $26.32 at this time). This was beneficial for the company to raise funds to put towards further r&d (ranch and dicks). Although this initially dropped the stock price, it then rose to its ATH of $30.57 just 2 weeks later. The following drop from all-time high can be related to natural selling of the stock as well as a maxim group downgrade from a “buy” to a “sell”. This downgrade was most likely due to a dude with a less than average sized dick. It might also simply be attributed to the stocks very fast run up earlier this year, and is based solely on valuation.\n\nSo, where are we today? Definitely not the Wendy's bathroom...anyway. Over the past five days, the stock price seems to have bounced off of a new low of $15.64 on June 22nd back to a price of $18.05 on June 24th. It has remained within this range over the past 3 days.\n\n What am I driving at here:\n\nImprovement in operating costs and increasing sales quarter over quarter show this company is becoming more efficient and are carving their name right into the fucking side of the augmented reality industry. Personally, I’m expecting to see killer earnings in q3 2021. A new (as of 06/02/2021) medical electrical equipment safety standard certification will push this equipment directly into the new remote medical environment created by the COVID epidemic. Anyway, I’m running out of steam. Maybe just ask Cathie Woods who bought the dip and added $13.5 million in Vuzix (as of 06/01) to the ARKW etf. She has previously added shares of Vuzix to the ARKQ fund as well. (I know, she didn't buy the top which in of itself shows some real development of her character)\n\nTLDR: Laser image eyeglass company lets surgeons cut people open better. A recent drop in share price provides a great entry point for a company with a great future.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2lbnri3lf771.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d45ef12023f8097c902afa974a3f771ac4a6d1f5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice.",

Vuzix is a crazy fucking eyewear company that are essentially the future of manufacturing and surgical tools. Now, why is this important? Google tried to do this shit like 8 years ago and nobody cared, right? Yes, that&#39;s correct. There’s one other thing that&#39;s correct too. Google&#39;s attempt absolutely sucked and they did not pursue improving their product. Vuzix remains on the leading edge of smart eyeglass technology with over 146 patents. So, it’s too late google, you already lost this one. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/czqvyeqgjf771.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc7fcc46d770489304b2090036d56895d0e230d4\">https://preview.redd.it/czqvyeqgjf771.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc7fcc46d770489304b2090036d56895d0e230d4</a></p>\n\n<p>Anyway since I took one semester of an entry level laser course in college, I’m going to explain this technology to you. The waveguide technology employed by vuzix deliver high quality, full color images directly to your fucking eyeball. Now, these images are completely transparent so it allows the user to still interact with natural reality. This differs from other products, which deliver a useless opaque image.</p>\n\n<p>Now how can this help with surgery? Do you remember when Tony Stark goes into repair mode while in the iron man suit?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vyrb1kyjjf771.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8fcee5ffcd29dc9d6fec61a83031e0094ef534b\">https://preview.redd.it/vyrb1kyjjf771.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8fcee5ffcd29dc9d6fec61a83031e0094ef534b</a></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, that’s what these glasses do. They can provide a whole digital map of whichever part of the body they are working on. That’s not all. They can also provide a live video stream with an augmented reality presence in order to assist surgical techs in helping their surgeon. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yjujg42njf771.png?width=1417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622d7f16edb9c84a3d8224121077358f89714a02\">https://preview.redd.it/yjujg42njf771.png?width=1417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622d7f16edb9c84a3d8224121077358f89714a02</a></p>\n\n<p>Now that I&#39;ve showed you some of Vuzix&#39;s tech lets take a look at the third graders their up against:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thirdeye Gen</strong> - really cool name, where’d they get that at? <em>Hot Topic??</em> Anyway, this company doesn’t hold a candle to Vuzix. They aren’t even attempting to use this crap in surgical applications yet, but they do have some implementations in healthcare by basically doing the same thing a tablet can do. This can also be said for their manufacturing applications as well. Plus, just look at these things:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bh6vfbhxjf771.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ebd116fe95f02e689942efd6209343ca8fc47b0\">https://preview.redd.it/bh6vfbhxjf771.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ebd116fe95f02e689942efd6209343ca8fc47b0</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Microvision</strong> - Need I say more</li>\n<li><strong>Vrteek</strong> - Mainly just focused on virtual tours and videos. That’s cool, stay in your fucking lane.</li>\n<li><strong>Manus VR -</strong> this is actually a really cool company, but their applications are more focused on digital production applications. This wouldn’t necessarily be a competitor at this time but since its along the same lines it should be mentioned</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Time to look at some numbers for you viewers with more then 10 brain cells:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 2020 Vuzix experienced very rapid growth. This can be attributed to technology finally catching up to the product as well as a lot of new big orders from reputable companies. In 2021 Vuzix saw sales increase 2.4 million dollars, or 177% year over year!!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Data interpreted from Vuzix website show Quarter 1 2021 results at a 49% improvement year over year.</li>\n<li>Sales of their products show an improvement of 2,383,000 year over year as well..</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>So , expenses.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Vuzix operating expenses reported in Q1 of 2021 were reported to be $7,654,000. Yes, these rose compared to the same quarter last year where operating expenses were $5,339,000. Obviously this is related to increased production.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What does this look like per share?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Vuzix reported net loss per share of -$.12. Year over year, this is a -$.06 improvement.</li>\n<li>Vuzix is becoming more efficient. With increased sales and lower operating costs this company is pushing towards positive cash flow in the coming quarters.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>See below from vuzix website</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wts336nakf771.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f938b9b99f88a7282aae023c248e3a89c6c967af\">https://preview.redd.it/wts336nakf771.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f938b9b99f88a7282aae023c248e3a89c6c967af</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/39ccipnckf771.png?width=1999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303d20bd25405d58fe71a1b2da2a414a761d6105\">https://preview.redd.it/39ccipnckf771.png?width=1999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303d20bd25405d58fe71a1b2da2a414a761d6105</a></p>\n\n<p>I want to talk about this stock over the past few months. Vuzix saw an amazing run up in their stock price following both their quarter 4 2020 results as well as the q1 2021 results. Following q1 2020 the stock price rose an incredible 443% to an at the time high of $23.59. Q1 2021 results brought a slight dip in the stock price followed by another run-up of 30% to an all time high of $30.57. Sounds like some real fomo territory right? Following this impressive all time high this stock has seen a decrease of 43%. It now sits at $17.48 per share. A bit of a drop from its ATH (aqua teen hunger...force).</p>\n\n<p>A drop in this territory is completely natural for a growing company. During a press release on March 26 Vuzix announced that they were offering 4.1 million shares of its common stock at $20.50 a share (compared to the stock price of $26.32 at this time). This was beneficial for the company to raise funds to put towards further r&amp;d (ranch and dicks). Although this initially dropped the stock price, it then rose to its ATH of $30.57 just 2 weeks later. The following drop from all-time high can be related to natural selling of the stock as well as a maxim group downgrade from a “buy” to a “sell”. This downgrade was most likely due to a dude with a less than average sized dick. It might also simply be attributed to the stocks very fast run up earlier this year, and is based solely on valuation.</p>\n\n<p>So, where are we today? Definitely not the Wendy&#39;s bathroom...anyway. Over the past five days, the stock price seems to have bounced off of a new low of $15.64 on June 22nd back to a price of $18.05 on June 24th. It has remained within this range over the past 3 days.</p>\n\n<p>What am I driving at here:</p>\n\n<p>Improvement in operating costs and increasing sales quarter over quarter show this company is becoming more efficient and are carving their name right into the fucking side of the augmented reality industry. Personally, I’m expecting to see killer earnings in q3 2021. A new (as of 06/02/2021) medical electrical equipment safety standard certification will push this equipment directly into the new remote medical environment created by the COVID epidemic. Anyway, I’m running out of steam. Maybe just ask Cathie Woods who bought the dip and added $13.5 million in Vuzix (as of 06/01) to the ARKW etf. She has previously added shares of Vuzix to the ARKQ fund as well. (I know, she didn&#39;t buy the top which in of itself shows some real development of her character)</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Laser image eyeglass company lets surgeons cut people open better. A recent drop in share price provides a great entry point for a company with a great future.</p>\n\n<p>Positions:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y2lbnri3lf771.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d45ef12023f8097c902afa974a3f771ac4a6d1f5\">https://preview.redd.it/y2lbnri3lf771.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d45ef12023f8097c902afa974a3f771ac4a6d1f5</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
