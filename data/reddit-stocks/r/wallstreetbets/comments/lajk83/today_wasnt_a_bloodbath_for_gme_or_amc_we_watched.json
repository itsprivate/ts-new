Just hold your stock, buy more if you can afford to! </p>\n\n<p>Check out real time trade stats by googling: &quot;Nasdaq AMC real time trades&quot; and you&#39;ll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. </p>\n\n<p>These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!</p>\n\n<p>The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was <strong>resistance</strong> You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks. </p>\n\n<p>The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we. </p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice. I’m just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <strong>LOOK AT THIS SHIT LOL</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beijing_bobby/status/1356377066988564486/photo/1\">https://twitter.com/beijing_bobby/status/1356377066988564486/photo/1</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: <strong>IF YOU’RE WONDERING IF YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING WITH $AMC EL PRES KNOWS AND IS STILL HOLDING.</strong> \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Thowe51/status/1356320431142268928?s=20\">https://twitter.com/Thowe51/status/1356320431142268928?s=20</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
