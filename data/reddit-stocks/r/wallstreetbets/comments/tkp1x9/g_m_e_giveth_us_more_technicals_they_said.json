We will revisit this idea later.](https://preview.redd.it/i2he1fqvu2p81.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7594ebd4b89b195e70e285aa0004defa65d42a3b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Rapidly Ballooning Short-Borrow Fees\n\n[Ortex's tweet](https://twitter.com/ORTEX/status/1506331956379750402?cxt=HHwWhMCs3d67yOcpAAAA) shows that short-sale interest did not decrease in yesterday's 50% price increase.  Instead, it went up to 24% of the free float.  Some would ask how the short increase from 21% to 24% in one business day is possible on an already-capped-out-for-31-days 100% utilization?  I digress - and we already know the answer as to why: they somehow obtained more shares to short with, as unreported, and clearly have not even begun to buy to cover their 'current plus new' short-sales yet.  Either way, these shorting-hedge-funds, nevertheless, are now facing elevated capital requirements.  We know that Ortex shows that max cost to borrow just jumped to over 45%, but let's take a look at Interactive Brokers borrow fee:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[IBKR's short-borrow rate has jumped above 12,000&amp;#37; \\(after hours\\).  This is statistically significant, as you can visually see the range breakout in the chart.  Pre-market and nominal open borrow rate may indeed be sustained above 100&amp;#37;, which implies an immediate, newfound demand for collateral for those with outsized short-borrows](https://preview.redd.it/0azs5d2bu2p81.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c75056fd43e3b460fcd69bac80a9a777bf5ca1c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Half of  G M E  Shares are now 'locked' and not transactable\n\nContrary to what was implied about me [by mainstream media yesterday](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-shares-soar-30-and-take-other-meme-stocks-on-a-ride-after-reddit-poster-touts-shares-at-a-58-2-discount-11647988145), my fundamental technical analysis was not the primary catalyst of the immediate supply-and-demand-based 50% rise in the share price.  I don't suspect that a billionaire, or anyone really, analyzed [my TA yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tjw86u/g_m_e_where_we_stand_with_the_technicals/) and decided, \"Oh, Thump4's TA shows that the stock is heavily discounted, so I must buy it.\"\n\nThe real catalyst seems to have been from raw demand, and most notably by G M E's chairman, who independently bought 100,000 more G M E shares in the morning, making his total ownership of the company 11.9%.  Although we have no data on what insiders are buying until SEC 13F forms are filed, insiders may indeed be continuing to purchase more raw shares since they are now able to 2 days after earnings.  Yet, this brings up an interesting technical topic: insider ownership shares are 'locked,' meaning these shares are *not* freely traded on the market.  Therefore, when we combine G M E's Directly Registered computershare total (10 Million shares registered with the transfer agent - 8.9M as noted from the [F-17 Page (page 10 on the pdf of last week's annual report)](https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/71e30d98-2102-4bdd-b0b8-eb151e09f803) and 1M+ estimates thereafter) with 23 Million shares institutionally owned ([as shown from fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) and thereby restricted, then we have a *past-looking sum* of 33 Million.  We can safely assume that 3 Million more shares will be either bought by insiders and/or directly registered with computershare this week (provided the newfound demand for the stock), so we are at 36 Million shares 'locked'.  Since the shares outstanding total is 76.34 Million, then that means that ***47.2% of the tradable shares outstanding are currently 'locked' and not able to be transacted on any market exchange, regardless of whether that market exchange is 'dark' or 'lit'****.*  This inherently implies that any movement in G M E 's  market price is about twice as sensitive to normal economic demand-vs-supply forces than a typical stock, because the float is literally cut in half.\n\nThis leads to a G M E stock price that is now hypersensitive to any demand for the stock, or net volume.  That was shown above, and a two-fold increase in nominal pressure on short-sellers who must fold their poker cards and buy-to-cover their egregious ([and some would say illegal](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prosecutors-explore-racketeering-charges-short-seller-probe-sources-2022-02-18/)) short-borrow liability position.  Them not doing so would technically lead to a [London-Metal-Exchange-like](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-chinese-nickel-market-mystery-london-metal-exchange-tsinghsan-11647982954) scenario, where in this case the entire global stock market would have to be halted for days for the NSCC to theoretically but illegally allow Citadel Securities, Point72, and other hedge funds to somehow maintain their shorts, similarly to the Chinese nickel short-selling 'tycoon.'  This scenario would permanently destroy faith in American markets for decades.  Them buying to cover now, while the price is still so discounted is safer for them, more responsible for the safety of American markets, and would allow for them to possibly survive this and be able to happily talk about how they got beat (kinda like the Citron Research guy who loved to claim afterward that he was so handsomely defeated by a bunch of reddit 'kids' in this generationally-dynamic market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Astronautical Fundamentals - the new digital-asset Marketplace\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[G M E 's non-fungible-asset marketplace is now out in 'beta'.  This being released in the evening, could serve as a new catalyst of buying demand for G M E stock, in that it will lead to a new revenue stream on sales of virtual art and gaming skins, worldwide](https://preview.redd.it/8ypcg42693p81.png?width=1241&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a05ad79bfa9e563e115ce9bb63d0bfb5c041050)\n\n# TLDR:\n\nHalf of  G M E 's shares are locked and not able to be further transacted.  This has caused an economic shortage of available supply of the stock - and this available supply clearly is rapidly diminishing.  Ortex max cost to borrow just ballooned above 45%, and IBKR's borrow fee rate just ballooned above 12,000%, marking a serious collateral demand and high probability of margin calls of short-sale positions: those short-sellers who now stand to face unlimited economic loss based on the elevated risk they fairly took by shorting this stock.  On Company fundamentals, the[ beta N..F..T.. marketplace website is out](https://beta.nft.gamestop.com/), implying the additional revenue stream from virtual art and gaming skin collectibles [is now live and powered on the backend by loop-ring L2](https://medium.loopring.io/gamestop-nft-marketplace-powered-by-loopring-l2-6cdb9289d937).  Technicals reveal that G M E 's Net Volume, from yesterday's 50% increase in share price, was paltry.  Volume is about 85 Million away from even being classified as a historically-noteworthy day for G M E.\n\nEdit: I am not considering fiddling with my DRS'd shares, nor am I closing [any of my call options positions](https://imgur.com/a/e5upBh9) at any point, even though I am up about 1000% yesterday.  I am upset that my transfer of my tax return into this account did not lead to a successful execution of my order for new call options.  But, I am confident that my new market order for them - yes, I know - for today will be executing at these prices that are clearly so discounted to the real net asset value.  When G M E 's return on their investment is realized, the stock could be worth $1,000.00's of dollars per share, but as a newer, sleeker, Web 3.0, block-chain-backed, highly-sophisticated Amazon-killer.",

Pre-market and nominal open borrow rate may indeed be sustained above 100&amp;#37;, which implies an immediate, newfound demand for collateral for those with outsized short-borrows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Half of  G M E  Shares are now &amp;#39;locked&amp;#39; and not transactable&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what was implied about me &lt;a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-shares-soar-30-and-take-other-meme-stocks-on-a-ride-after-reddit-poster-touts-shares-at-a-58-2-discount-11647988145\"&gt;by mainstream media yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, my fundamental technical analysis was not the primary catalyst of the immediate supply-and-demand-based 50% rise in the share price.  I don&amp;#39;t suspect that a billionaire, or anyone really, analyzed &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tjw86u/g_m_e_where_we_stand_with_the_technicals/\"&gt;my TA yesterday&lt;/a&gt; and decided, &amp;quot;Oh, Thump4&amp;#39;s TA shows that the stock is heavily discounted, so I must buy it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real catalyst seems to have been from raw demand, and most notably by G M E&amp;#39;s chairman, who independently bought 100,000 more G M E shares in the morning, making his total ownership of the company 11.9%.  Although we have no data on what insiders are buying until SEC 13F forms are filed, insiders may indeed be continuing to purchase more raw shares since they are now able to 2 days after earnings.  Yet, this brings up an interesting technical topic: insider ownership shares are &amp;#39;locked,&amp;#39; meaning these shares are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; freely traded on the market.  Therefore, when we combine G M E&amp;#39;s Directly Registered computershare total (10 Million shares registered with the transfer agent - 8.9M as noted from the &lt;a href=\"https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/71e30d98-2102-4bdd-b0b8-eb151e09f803\"&gt;F-17 Page (page 10 on the pdf of last week&amp;#39;s annual report)&lt;/a&gt; and 1M+ estimates thereafter) with 23 Million shares institutionally owned (&lt;a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/gme\"&gt;as shown from fintel&lt;/a&gt;) and thereby restricted, then we have a &lt;em&gt;past-looking sum&lt;/em&gt; of 33 Million.  We can safely assume that 3 Million more shares will be either bought by insiders and/or directly registered with computershare this week (provided the newfound demand for the stock), so we are at 36 Million shares &amp;#39;locked&amp;#39;.  Since the shares outstanding total is 76.34 Million, then that means that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;47.2% of the tradable shares outstanding are currently &amp;#39;locked&amp;#39; and not able to be transacted on any market exchange, regardless of whether that market exchange is &amp;#39;dark&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;lit&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  This inherently implies that any movement in G M E &amp;#39;s  market price is about twice as sensitive to normal economic demand-vs-supply forces than a typical stock, because the float is literally cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This leads to a G M E stock price that is now hypersensitive to any demand for the stock, or net volume.  That was shown above, and a two-fold increase in nominal pressure on short-sellers who must fold their poker cards and buy-to-cover their egregious (&lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prosecutors-explore-racketeering-charges-short-seller-probe-sources-2022-02-18/\"&gt;and some would say illegal&lt;/a&gt;) short-borrow liability position.  Them not doing so would technically lead to a &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-chinese-nickel-market-mystery-london-metal-exchange-tsinghsan-11647982954\"&gt;London-Metal-Exchange-like&lt;/a&gt; scenario, where in this case the entire global stock market would have to be halted for days for the NSCC to theoretically but illegally allow Citadel Securities, Point72, and other hedge funds to somehow maintain their shorts, similarly to the Chinese nickel short-selling &amp;#39;tycoon.&amp;#39;  This scenario would permanently destroy faith in American markets for decades.  Them buying to cover now, while the price is still so discounted is safer for them, more responsible for the safety of American markets, and would allow for them to possibly survive this and be able to happily talk about how they got beat (kinda like the Citron Research guy who loved to claim afterward that he was so handsomely defeated by a bunch of reddit &amp;#39;kids&amp;#39; in this generationally-dynamic market).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Astronautical Fundamentals - the new digital-asset Marketplace&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8ypcg42693p81.png?width=1241&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1a05ad79bfa9e563e115ce9bb63d0bfb5c041050\"&gt;G M E &amp;#39;s non-fungible-asset marketplace is now out in &amp;#39;beta&amp;#39;.  This being released in the evening, could serve as a new catalyst of buying demand for G M E stock, in that it will lead to a new revenue stream on sales of virtual art and gaming skins, worldwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;TLDR:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half of  G M E &amp;#39;s shares are locked and not able to be further transacted.  This has caused an economic shortage of available supply of the stock - and this available supply clearly is rapidly diminishing.  Ortex max cost to borrow just ballooned above 45%, and IBKR&amp;#39;s borrow fee rate just ballooned above 12,000%, marking a serious collateral demand and high probability of margin calls of short-sale positions: those short-sellers who now stand to face unlimited economic loss based on the elevated risk they fairly took by shorting this stock.  On Company fundamentals, the&lt;a href=\"https://beta.nft.gamestop.com/\"&gt; beta N..F..T.. marketplace website is out&lt;/a&gt;, implying the additional revenue stream from virtual art and gaming skin collectibles &lt;a href=\"https://medium.loopring.io/gamestop-nft-marketplace-powered-by-loopring-l2-6cdb9289d937\"&gt;is now live and powered on the backend by loop-ring L2&lt;/a&gt;.  Technicals reveal that G M E &amp;#39;s Net Volume, from yesterday&amp;#39;s 50% increase in share price, was paltry.  Volume is about 85 Million away from even being classified as a historically-noteworthy day for G M E.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I am not considering fiddling with my DRS&amp;#39;d shares, nor am I closing &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/e5upBh9\"&gt;any of my call options positions&lt;/a&gt; at any point, even though I am up about 1000% yesterday.  I am upset that my transfer of my tax return into this account did not lead to a successful execution of my order for new call options.  But, I am confident that my new market order for them - yes, I know - for today will be executing at these prices that are clearly so discounted to the real net asset value.  When G M E &amp;#39;s return on their investment is realized, the stock could be worth $1,000.00&amp;#39;s of dollars per share, but as a newer, sleeker, Web 3.0, block-chain-backed, highly-sophisticated Amazon-killer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
