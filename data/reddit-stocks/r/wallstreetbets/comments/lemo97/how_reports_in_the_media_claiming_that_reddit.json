Turns out there are over 1000 articles on it. But in doing that research I found a fairly accurate history of how this all started. And, just to be clear, a post on WSB did set the price of Silver skyrocketing; but, also to be clear, some reporters are just lazy.</h1>\n\n<h1><strong>Background</strong></h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Monday, January 25, 2021, $GME stock reached a high price of $159 per share before dropping to $76. Even though the CNBC people were calling this “A Side Show,” they spent most of the day talking about it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>-Tuesday, January 26th, 2021, $GME closes at $147 per share. WSB goes Viral on news that Melvin Capital needed a 2.5 Billion dollar bail out. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pnax/wsb_traffic_growth_what_going_viral_looks_like/\">WSB clocks 15 million unique searches that day alone.</a></p>\n\n<p>-Wednesday, January 27th, 2021, WSB was national and international front-page news. $GME hits $350 per share. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gamestop-reddit-explainer-what-s-happening-stock-market-n1255922\">Here’s the Today Show segment about us, showing front page headlines, and Stephanie Rule showing us some love… despite being worried for ‘new investors’ (but we’ll definitely take the love part)</a></p>\n\n<h1>January 27th, 2021:</h1>\n\n<h1>How the Reddit / $SLV Rumor began</h1>\n\n<h2>(I’m just assuming WSB was getting 25 million hits by this day)\\</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On Thursday, January 27, 2021, <a href=\"/u/jjalaj30\">u/jjalaj30</a> (who is not a bot) posted:\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/gl1u57n/?context=3\">“THE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN THE WORLD SLV SILVER $25-$1000”</a>  Good for Him being passionate about his investments, BTW! This post must have been seen by millions because, I’m just assuming, WSB was getting 25 million hits by this day given the virality of the previous days.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Sales of Silver ETFs and Spot began to rise </p>\n\n<p>$GME reaches $480 (OP buys 1.45 shares of $GME at $360 because Why Not. Also bought $BBBY at $36… and holding).  Robinhood shuts down trading, $GME price starts immediately crashing </p>\n\n<p>2.On Thursday afternoon, at 12:03pm (I’m assuming eastern time?) the First article about Reddit causing the price Silver to go up is written by Reuters.  <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29X2DT\">“Reddit raiders swarm silver stocks as GameStop, BlackBerry retreat”</a> and quotes directly from <a href=\"/u/jjalaj30\">u/jjalaj30</a>’s post</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>On Thursday afternoon, 2:45pm, metal industry websites and investor blogs begin running blog articles stating ”Reddit Day Traders” are fueling this random rise in Silver sales:\n-<a href=\"https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/silver-prices-012820212\">Bullion Vault</a> \n-<a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/news/silver-prices-surge-as-reddits-retail-army-refocuses-wrath-against-precious-metal-short-sellers-202101281501\">Street</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The first article claiming WSB was leaving $GME and heading to silver came from the Wall Street Journal at 4:38pm: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silver-surges-as-gamestop-day-traders-move-into-other-assets-11611848703?mod=searchresults_pos8&amp;amp;page=1\">Silver Surges as Game Stop Traders Move Into Other Assets.</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Blogger/reporter Anna Golubova posted an article at 11:48pm on Kitco about an Army of Day Traders piling into silver? She explains that analysts think the price of silver will reach $40 and <a href=\"https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-28/Army-of-day-traders-piling-into-silver-As-prices-rally-analysts-point-to-40-and-higher.html\">shares a screenshot of the above post by u/jjalaj30.</a></p></li>\n<li><p>However, The London based Investors Chronicles gave a good analysis of why Silver (and Gold) were higher. <a href=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/news/2021/01/29/robinhood-anger-silver-linings/\">They say its because the US dollar slid.</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Friday, January 29, 2021</h2>\n\n<p>7.Friday, 2am, Bloomberg runs a story: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/silver-market-jitters-are-on-display-after-reddit-frenzy\">Reddit Investors piling into silver raise prices a Second Day.</a></p>\n\n<p>8.Friday Morning, Kitco News does a long segement discussing the Wednesday Reddit post about shorting Silver: <a href=\"https://www.kitco.com/news/video/show/Market-Analysis/3191/2021-01-29/Retail-investors-want-to-short-squeeze-silver-to-$1k-is-this-possible#_48_INSTANCE_puYLh9Vd66QY_=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kitco.com%2Fnews%2Fvideo%2Flatest%3Fshow%3DMarket-Analysis\">https://www.kitco.com/news/video/show/Market-Analysis/3191/2021-01-29/Retail-investors-want-to-short-squeeze-silver-to-$1k-is-this-possible#_48_INSTANCE_puYLh9Vd66QY_=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kitco.com%2Fnews%2Fvideo%2Flatest%3Fshow%3DMarket-Analysis</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>But a metal indusrty blog Mining [dot] Com does an entry on Friday morning cslling this a <strong><em>“Frenzy.”</em></strong>: <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/silver-prices-higher-on-reddit-frenzy/\">Silver Prices rally for second day on Reddit Frenzy</a>\\</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Weekend sales of physical Silver soar. From Friday to Monday the price of Silver goes from $25.50 to $28.50. That’s a huge jump in the silver market. Somehow, the only explanation for this has to be Reddit, right.\\</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sunday, January 31, 2021. Bllomberg TV does a story: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-01/reddit-inspired-army-takes-aim-at-silver-video\">Reddit-Inspired Army takes aim at silver.</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>By Monday, Feburary 1, 2021. All the news outlets are running with a story that Reddit is causing the silver price to spike.</h2>\n\n<p>The Wall Street Journal runs story: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddits-silver-rush-is-another-symptom-of-market-madness-11612183688?mod=searchresults_pos6&amp;amp;page=1\">Reddit’s Silver Rush Is Another Symptom of Market Madness</a></p>\n\n<p>If you go to Google News and type in “Reddit Silver” for that date of Feburary 1st, 2021, you’ll get 13 pages of results. This is my favorite one:</p>\n\n<p>Monday, Feburary1, 2021, at 11:53am, Yahoo Finance publishes a story based on a person’s tweet (I’m not kidding, its based on a Tweet): <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-gamestop-thanks-reddit-precious-163259125.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZDsEHA-5OI2NT7xu3gDSn-lm5-Z3hF-SmzHD37Ltfe7CsXTW2GlA34k2slxHlCvDD0sz94ubt2biqmTiijfuYhyEnN_GiRvx7SsCjgw0WMVtUaqP8xPAHS2f0-AfSx5O9Dx5rG13NR6nZCpwMx6X9vRl97RIalfeddG-tctorR\">Is Silver the New Game Stop? Thanks to Reddit, Precious Metals hits 11 year high.</a></p>\n\n<h2>On Tuesday, 3/2/2021, The price of silver ‘corrects.’ Stocks WSB are HOLDING THE LINE on ($GME, $AMC, $BB,) start losing some market value too. So naturally all the new outlets lump Sliver, $GME, $AMC, $BB as one WSB total corridnated Short-Squeeze attack that failed because all these Redditors were stupid.</h2>\n\n<p>Tuesday, Forbes: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2021/02/02/reddit-group-fails-in-effort-to-squeeze-the-silver-market/?sh=2e2dde403bcb\">Reddit Group Fails in Effort to Squeeze Silver Market</a></p>\n\n<p>Ben Martin of the Sunday Times wrote on Tuesday: <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/reddit-army-falters-as-silver-rally-loses-steam-cs5gfpjh7\">The spot silver price slid by 8 per cent from Monday’s eight-year high as a rush into the metal by amateur traders co-ordinating on the Reddit social media website faltered</a>\\</p>\n\n<h2>So, Yes, a Redditor did post on WSB about silver. Reuters ran a story about the post, then Metal Industry people wrote articles about the post after Reuters, then The Wall Street Journal said WSB moving away from $GME and into silver, then lazy journalism took over where other reporters just start copying other reporters’ articles <a href=\"https://observer.com/2015/04/journalisms-sourcing-problem/\"> - Here is a Good Read on that - </a>, and then when silver corrected on the same day $GME and $AMC took a hit, all the media blamed us.</h2>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
