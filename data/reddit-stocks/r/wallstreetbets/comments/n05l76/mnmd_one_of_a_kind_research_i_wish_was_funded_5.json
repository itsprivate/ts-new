I had people in my life that I wish had the opportunity to experience this type of treatment. A treatment outside of conventional pharma or therapy, both of which I am a huge advocate for (please always seek help), but sometimes there is a different means. Something that could have helped the person who everyone said they &quot;tried everything&quot; for. I&#39;m sick of hearing we tried everything when there is more. I hope we can continue to progress and alter our perception of how to treat the many different things that so many struggle with every day.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the only thing this company produces is one new treatment at least it adds one more thing to the &quot;tried everything&quot; process, because it&#39;s one more thing that could have maybe helped him.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
