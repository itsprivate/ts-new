I got the call because I begrudgingly love this sub and the autists that frequent it.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, so people want to buy FD&#39;s and get paid but it&#39;s important to understand what you&#39;re actually doing when you buy that option and pay that premium.</p>\n\n<p>I am hoping that I won&#39;t be downvoted to oblivion because I&#39;m actually trying to help people understand as much as I can and be more successful. I&#39;m not an expert so this is my best understanding of how options work.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s talk about options...</p>\n\n<h2>Strike Price</h2>\n\n<p>A strike price is the set price at which a derivative contract can be bought or sold when it is <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp\">exercised</a>. For <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\">call options</a>, the strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder; for <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp\">put options</a>, the strike price is the price at which the security can be sold.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp</a></p>\n\n<p>the strike price is what everyone screams about and it&#39;s the magic numbers we want to watch the price go to in order to ensure our options are In The Money (ITM) If options are ITM that means that your option has value, even if it doesn&#39;t go past the point where you hit a break even ( which ideally you want to see to realize a profit) All option contracts that are ITM are subject to potential exercise and this is where the magic happens.</p>\n\n<p>Options that expire OTM are worthless. All those 3/5 C800, yes all 30,000 of them that expired? Free money to the people that sold them to you? Why did you give free money to the people that are going to spend it to try to stop you from making more money? Well probably because you didn&#39;t understand what you were doing.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Premium</h1>\n\n<p>This is the money you paid to the option seller. The hedge fund, the market maker, the theta Chad trying to fuck your wife&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s girlfriend. You need to keep in mind that this money goes directly into their pocket and they don&#39;t just put it away for a rainy day. They may do shit with that money to increase their chances of being correct and decrease your chance of being out of the money (OTM)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h2>Delta</h2>\n\n<p>Delta is the ratio that compares the change in the price of an asset, usually <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketable_security.asp\">marketable securities</a>, to the corresponding change in the price of its <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp\">derivative</a>. For example, if a stock option has a delta value of 0.65, this means that if the underlying stock increases in price by $1 per share, the option on it will rise by $0.65 per share, all else being equal.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp</a></p>\n\n<p>At-The-Money options typically have Deltas hanging around .5 ($.50 per $1 of underlying price movement) where as far OTM calls have extremely low Delta because they&#39;re still extremely unlikely to expire ITM. Options that are ITM already have Delta&#39;s around 1($1 for every $1 of underlying price movement) because every gain is seen as a profit because you&#39;re already past the point of probability.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h2>Gamma</h2>\n\n<p>Gamma is the rate of change in an option&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp\">delta</a> per 1-point move in the underlying asset&#39;s price. Gamma is an important measure of the convexity of a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp\">derivative&#39;s</a> value, in relation to the underlying. A <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp\">delta hedge</a> strategy seeks to reduce gamma in order to maintain a hedge over a wider price range. A consequence of reducing gamma, however, is that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp\">alpha</a> will also be reduced.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Gamma incorporates time. Gamma will be low and look much like a bell curve with respect to time. When time decreases the price of the option is extremely sensitive to time because you have less time to see your option change in value. ITM options become increasingly more likely to expire ITM and OTM options become increasingly less valuable because it would take a fucking miracle to make them ITM.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Let&#39;s talk about orders and price movement a little</h1>\n\n<p>What makes selling an option safe? What makes it risky? Ask yourself a simple question. if you want to be successful are you move likely to sell an OTM call at C50 or C500. Obviously you&#39;re more likely to not get assigned your call exercise if your strike price is higher. How can you understand the risk?</p>\n\n<p>A few key concepts</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Volume</h1>\n\n<p>Knowing how much buying and selling happens on a regular basis can inform your intuition as to how much volatility you might expect. If you see a stock with a volume of 1M you might assume from that the chance of volume of 100M is very low.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Holding</h1>\n\n<p>Holding your shares of your stock does a few things when we consider basic economics</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It lowers the supply of the desired underlying.</li>\n<li>It may not have any effect at all on the demand</li>\n<li>Smart people will look at a &#39;cult&#39; of people holding and understand that this is a &#39;control&#39; or a constant rather than a variable on which they can incorporate to make decisions. If you know people won&#39;t sell suddenly and that if you can presume that they have no more buying your a portion of your risk is mitigated by the simple fact that you are concluding a buying frenzy is unlikely to occur =&gt; making sold calls safer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Consider the bloodbath of the past few weeks. Stocks are tumbling but GME... it&#39;s basically stayed very consistent. Some stocks are down 20/30 percent, but GME is basically flat. How? people aren&#39;t selling and they also aren&#39;t buying that much.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Open Interest</h1>\n\n<p>Open interest is sometimes confused with trading <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp\">volume</a>, but the two terms refer to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050615/what-difference-between-open-interest-and-volume.asp\">different measures</a>. On a day when one trader who already holds 10 option contracts sells those 10 contracts to a new trader entering the market, the transfer of contracts does not create any change in the open interest figure for that particular option.</p>\n\n<p>No new option contracts have been added to the market because one trader is transferring their position to another. However, the sale of the 10 option contracts by an existing option holder to an option buyer does increase the trading volume figure for the day by 10 contracts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp</a></p>\n\n<h1>What strikes are people buying calls for?

It&#39;s not for rich people.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at what some folks are buying these days</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0kcgnkle5cl61.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=346f279562a639f270f3aace65f050af4066a58d\">https://preview.redd.it/0kcgnkle5cl61.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=346f279562a639f270f3aace65f050af4066a58d</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ycm0qj1d5cl61.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd7f30c9ba32c1bbe354bee1b350dca3af680ab8\">https://preview.redd.it/ycm0qj1d5cl61.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd7f30c9ba32c1bbe354bee1b350dca3af680ab8</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jzu7qymu3cl61.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1407dcfa5492f20d740b073dad7c9c91f0f702e6\">Do you guys see what the problem is yet?</a></p>\n\n<p>People are spending their money buying these retarded calls that have no chance of success.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Remember when I said earlier that if you sell a call and you have money it&#39;s in your best interest to use that money to increase your chance of success?</p>\n\n<p>It makes sense to spend as much much as you need to to mitigate risks. If you winning cost them $100,000,000 and it will only cost them $99,999,999.99 to make sure you don&#39;t expire ITM, guess what...</p>\n\n<p>THEY&#39;RE GOING TO DO THAT THING.</p>\n\n<p>This is the basic economics of opportunity cost. For you retards that didn&#39;t take economics or don&#39;t read it means the valuable path is derived by comparing it to all other paths.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously they&#39;re not spending all of their premium to make sure options expire ITM, if they were it&#39;d be a bad trade to begin with. These folks are smart, they know math, understand probability and have a deep understand of options arbitration, orders, limits etc.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>So what am I saying?</h1>\n\n<h1>TLDR</h1>\n\n<p>Buying super far OTM calls is fucking retarded. You&#39;re just handing the people you&#39;re trying to beat free money. It&#39;s harder to win when you keep giving all the advantages to the people you&#39;re trying to take money from</p>\n\n<p>Buying ATM/ or close OTM (Next Strike) has a very real possibility of actually making you money. Those options might actually cause a price increase.</p>\n\n<p>If people who bought calls were stacked ATM near the current market price this could very easily start a gamma squeeze. Every seller doesn&#39;t want to get fucked so every single one of them is going to try to cover their own ass.</p>\n\n<p>Like if the options were something like</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>135 - 15,000</li>\n<li>140 - 12,000</li>\n<li>145 - 20,000</li>\n<li>150 - 15,000</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>SUDDENLY</h1>\n\n<p>All of the call sellers become potential panic-buyers afraid of losing their Manhattan condo.</p>\n\n<p>Do you see the difference? Every time a strike is hit the next strike becomes almost destined to be hit. The amount of shares needed to cover those sold calls forces the price up if they&#39;re exercised and it&#39;s a mathimagical chain reaction. The important thing to look at is what is the volume of limit sells between the strike prices? if there isn&#39;t enough shares between strike prices that are within that price range it $135 going ITM makes not only $140 to go ITM but now suddenly $145 may become ITM and we haven&#39;t even dealt with $140 yet. Do you get it now? </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t come at with that bullshit like I&#39;m a shill or bot either check my history I was posting DD pre-GME craze.</p>\n\n<p>If you think I&#39;m wrong =&gt; cool. But don&#39;t downvote me because I&#39;m trying to help you. I wish all of you the best and I hope GME goes to $1,000 and Biden legally classifies DFV as the first living deity in human history.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
