  "selftext": "**TL;DR**\n\n* No tapering or rate hikes until 2022, at the earliest. So 6 more months of bull market. Buy calls.\n* JPow is buying so many bonds, that the bond market is no longer a reliable indicator of inflation.\n\nI had been eagerly awaiting Jerry Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole, and honestly thought he would have actually said something. Instead, it was mostly a nothing-burger. So brrrrrrrrr it keeps going; at least for six more months.\n\n**Summary of Speech:**\n\nHe talked for a while and basically rehashed the same stuff he’s been saying. Let me save you your time:\n\n* Inflation is transitory. Nothing to see here.\n* Inflation should get back to 2%\n* Covid could still pose a problem, even though the recovery is moving right along.\n\nJPow said nothing about when QE might slow down; only that he ***might do it if*** the economy gets stronger. Which is what’s he’s said for a year? This is a very weaksauce indicator.\n\n**Economic Metrics:**\n\nStocks? All time highs.\n\nHousing prices? All time highs.\n\nUnemployment? 5%? Companies are begging for workers and $15/hr is the defacto minimum wage.\n\nInflation? It is also roaring.\n\nThere is no economic case to keep QE running at $120 billion per year.  The market can stay irrational longer than bears can stay solvent, especially when the market is pumped up by brrrrrrrr.\n\nSo what happened and how can we make money?\n\nThe $USD nose-dived on Powell’s speech. Various US dollar ETFs (DXY, UUP, USDU, UDN) are now hitting their 50 day moving averages or moving in that direction.  Just pick one of those ETFs and look at their chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sc0069ej3k71.jpg?width=1589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74daa04d179749b165fc625310bd69be8309ccaa\n\nHere is another example from another US Dollar ETF. Both show their 200 day and 50 day moving averages coming together, and now they are hitting or crashing through their 50 day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88eh38ggj3k71.jpg?width=1592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07b1d395c0abde85105304307628df90298027c8\n\nGLD and other gold etfs also broke above their long term moving averages after JPow’s speech. Here is GLD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pi49fxxij3k71.jpg?width=1588&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0be5686a41e5ebfdb7121e7370f059276f84aab2\n\nThe fall in the Dollar and sharp rise in gold are both an important signal. If the US Dollar holds here, its strengthening is over and it is time to go (stay?) whole hog into inflationary stocks, precious metals, etc.   And that’s what most of us are holding, so that’s good news.\n\nOne final note: When you see tables like this on CNBC, ignore them (more than you already do)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/32mybqwlj3k71.jpg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=589b532bd025f329aae3fe1244a6d43870d5fc9b\n\nIn every textbook or old investing book, for like 100 years, bonds were a good indicator of inflation and deflation. Bond traders were very savvy, the markets were deep and liquid, etc. But with years of QE, the Fed now owns trillions of dollars of bonds, and is still spending nearly $1 trillion per year buying more Treasury bonds. For certain US treasury bonds, the Fed owns more than 50% of the outstanding bonds. So, the bond market is not going to react as accurately as in the past, when the biggest whale in the pond only buys bonds, and never sells them, and buys \\~$80 billion of Treasury bonds per month.  And JPow has committed to keep buying them for at least 6 months.\n\nBull market continues, inflation will rip.\n\nBuy 3 and 6 month out SPY calls. Other inflationary plays are stuff like GLD, Rio Tinto (RTNTF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX), and individual gold and silver mining companies and ETFs, but each of these asset types can have individual risks and are not purely driven by inflation.\n\n**EDIT:** SPY 475 by end of year is my conservative guess.

Bond traders were very savvy, the markets were deep and liquid, etc. But with years of QE, the Fed now owns trillions of dollars of bonds, and is still spending nearly $1 trillion per year buying more Treasury bonds. For certain US treasury bonds, the Fed owns more than 50% of the outstanding bonds. So, the bond market is not going to react as accurately as in the past, when the biggest whale in the pond only buys bonds, and never sells them, and buys ~$80 billion of Treasury bonds per month.  And JPow has committed to keep buying them for at least 6 months.</p>\n\n<p>Bull market continues, inflation will rip.</p>\n\n<p>Buy 3 and 6 month out SPY calls. Other inflationary plays are stuff like GLD, Rio Tinto (RTNTF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX), and individual gold and silver mining companies and ETFs, but each of these asset types can have individual risks and are not purely driven by inflation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> SPY 475 by end of year is my conservative guess.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
