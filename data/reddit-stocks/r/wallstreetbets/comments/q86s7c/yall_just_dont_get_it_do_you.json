You subconsciously believe 100% runups in 15 months is fairly normal.\n\nEvergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real.\n\nAssuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood.\n\nWhy isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market. Just watch the Big Short again, there is a substantial period where swaps are not priced properly even as defaults skyrocket, as various investment banks try to get ahead of the crisis and \"head for the exit in a crowded theater.\"\n\nIMO, the people who are going to hurt the most are the thetards who have been selling naked puts and making bank for the past year and don't realize how exposed they really are.
