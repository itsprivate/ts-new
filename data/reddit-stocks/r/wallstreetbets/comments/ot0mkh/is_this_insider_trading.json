Now, like we get quite a few cars but not as many, but we have quite a few more people walking in for takeaway.\n\n My guess is approximately 300(+-100) come in per hour but before it was around 310 (+-110) at McDonalds and at Wendy's it is now 200 (+-80) versus the 214.20(+-100) it was before. These were done by calculating the average by using different weights depending on the time that I selected at random.\n\nAlso, I am not really sure how reliable my numbers are as sometimes I would get bored and just guess the number of customers that were there.\n\nMy question is, as I have done this technical analysis, would it be insider trading to buy a bunch of puts as I think McDonalds and Wendy's will both tank like around 10% (+-15%)because fewer people are ordering. Like McDonalds has at least 10,00,00 stores in the USA so it will be quite a significant amount of dropping and I can also long McDonalds when Wendy's release their earnings first as when their stock drops McDonalds will also go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S: Is it insider trading if it is like 500 usd?\n\nEdit: guys I just checked and their next earnings is at the end of this week as there is a contract expiring on 7/30.
