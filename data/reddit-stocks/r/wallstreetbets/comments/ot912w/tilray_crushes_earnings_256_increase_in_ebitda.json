The increase was driven by 36% growth in net cannabis revenue to $53.7 million, which included four weeks of contribution from legacy-Tilray, a 10% decline in distribution revenue, net beverage alcohol revenue of $15.9 million following our SweetWater acquisition on November 25, 2020, and wellness revenue of $5.8 million from Manitoba Harvest.\n\nNet income of $33.6 million during the fourth quarter compared to net loss of $84.3 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 285% to $12.3 million during the fourth quarter from $3.2 million in the prior year quarter marking the ninth consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nGross profit decreased 19% to $22.5 million during the fourth quarter from $27.8 million in the prior year quarter.  Included in gross profit was a one-time inventory valuation adjustment of $19.9 million resulting from excess inventory quantities upon the business combination with Aphria. Adjusted gross profit, excluding inventory valuation adjustment, increased 53% to $42.4 million during the fourth quarter from $27.8 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nFree cash flow increased 112% to $3.3 million in the fourth quarter from ($28.3) million in the prior year quarter. \n\n**Financial Highlights- 2021 Fiscal Year** \n\nNet revenue increased 27% to $513.1 million during 2021 from $405.3 million in 2020. The increase was driven by 55% growth in net cannabis revenue to $201.4 million, which included four weeks of contribution from legacy-Tilray, 1% growth in distribution revenue to $277.3 million, net beverage alcohol revenue of $28.6 million following our SweetWater acquisition on November 25, 2020, and wellness revenue of $5.8 million from Manitoba Harvest due to our Tilray reverse acquisition on April 30, 2021.\n\nNet loss of $336.0 million in 2021 compared to net loss of $100.8 million in 2020 was driven by $63.6 million of transaction costs related to out-of-pocket fees to consummate our business combinations, and $170.5 million of non-cash unrealized loss on our convertible debentures.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 598% to $40.8 million in 2021 from $5.8 million in 2020. \n\nGross profit increased 28% to $123.2 million during 2021 from $96.1 million in the prior year.  Included in gross profit was a one-time inventory valuation adjustment of $19.9 million in Q4 resulting from excess inventory quantities upon the business combination with Aphria.  Adjusted gross profit, excluding inventory valuation adjustment, increased 50% to $143.9 million in 2021 from $96.1 million in 2020.\n\nEnded the year with a strong balance sheet and liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $488.5 million",
