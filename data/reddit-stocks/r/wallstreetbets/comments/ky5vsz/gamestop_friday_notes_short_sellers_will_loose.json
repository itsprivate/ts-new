I want to use this opportunity to thank everyone for holding their line. Many of us, including myself, have bought more shares today and will continue to do so until we see the actual squeeze happening.</p>\n\n<h3>📅 This has happened today:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An annoucement was made that GME board members who are resigning have sold their shares causing today&#39;s price drop as a reaction by the market to these news (NEGATIVE but the market came together and held the line to minimize impact)</li>\n<li>Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin on $GME (NEUTRAL)</li>\n<li>There is current talk about margin calls going out soon (POSITIVE)</li>\n<li>Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday (POSITIVE)<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>🔮 This will happen soon:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Short sellers will be margin called soon - there is no way around this now</li>\n<li><strong>We will have another large squeeze</strong></li>\n<li>GameStop will undergo a huge transformation and capitalize on the ever-growing esports / video game market</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h3>🐻 Melvin and other short sellers</h3>\n\n<p>You targeted the wrong firm! You were gambling on 45,000+ people (FT &amp; PT) to loose their jobs as GameStop would slowly go out of business. </p>\n\n<p>But guess what: after Ryan Cohen bought further into GME this will never happen. The team at RC Ventures will make sure of that. And us, we will hold the line and buy further into it until we get rid of all large short positions. GME is not a dead company, it is just getting started.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GameStop is here to stay and will undergo an amazing transformation!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Note: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have very low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence.</p>\n\n<p>PS:  🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Positions: 190 shares, 5 1/22 $38c (full reinvestment of my old calls)</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Today was a rough day but an amazing setup for the coming week. $GME will go to the moon.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: explained some confusing bullet points</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
