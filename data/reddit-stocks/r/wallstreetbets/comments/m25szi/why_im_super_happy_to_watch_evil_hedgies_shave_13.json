I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I&#39;ll reach 9.</p>\n\n<p>That being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let&#39;s be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren&#39;t 100% sure.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m an expert in Chinese history, and I&#39;ll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”</p>\n\n<p>Truth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn&#39;t tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we&#39;ve been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.</p>\n\n<p>And let&#39;s be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s definitely a lot of time. At that scale it&#39;s not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.</p>\n\n<p>So what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts <em>HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED</em>. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today&#39;s coordinated attack wouldn&#39;t have happened.</p>\n\n<p>Not just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! </p>\n\n<p>You know it&#39;s like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Chinese History, there&#39;s this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it&#39;s costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.</p>\n\n<p>Fellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.</p>\n\n<p>Now... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/aTaF8j6\">to the skeptics who need proof for everything</a></p>\n\n<p>I obviously have better things than to post everything on social media like a attention seeking person. I&#39;m a retarded ape not a peacock. Your tongues will wag too no matter what even if my picture has shown my platform to be ancient. But that&#39;s nothing to do with my investing preferences. </p>\n\n<p>For you skeptics who need proof for everything and choose to always doubt and flake, here it is. &quot;A confident man does not live for the applause and approval of the non-worthy&quot;. Your skeptical outlook has only said to me that you clearly did not see Gamestop for what it really was earlier on, and even if DFV&#39;s DD was shown to you in those days, you were a late adopter. It has also shown me that you have the paper hands tendency when you don&#39;t see potential and when the going gets tough. </p>\n\n<p>I thought I have surpassed and ignored most silly comments, but thanks to the 1% of negative words, you have helped me see I still react to silly nonsense and it&#39;s something I need to change in myself. You are a Hyena and this is a community of apes. Reflect on yourselves.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
