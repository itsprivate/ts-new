Second week for BBBY is also a gap up on Monday and ended up the week over 60% from last Friday.\n\n- Third week is where all the action in GME took place, a big 50% gap up Monday before it settled down a bit lower and then huge moves on that Tues and Wed, closing the week around $320. Let’s see what this upcoming third week brings to BBBY.\n\nSome other observations. GME short percentage of the float was definitely higher and shorts were caught off guard, you’d think they’re better prepared this time. Also, Ryan Cohen took his stake around 4 months before the GME run-up and here we are 5 months after he disclosed his stake in March.\n\nThe other observation is the level of contempt the financial media and analysts had for GME as though they knew better and tried to save us from our own stupidity. Analysts started coming out of the woodwork panning GME, how it’s a failing business, how it’s going bankrupt, how it’ll be back to $5 next week. Even that same dude, Anthony Chukumba, was all over CNBC and Bloomberg talking how Gamestop is worth $10 and that’s him being generous. The higher the fever pitch against GME, the more interest the stock generated on this board and elsewhere, as if it was an us against them battle. The more people bought the stock and calls, the higher chance for a Gamma squeeze and here we are again with call options exploding and heading into monthly expiration where things can get really wild.\n\nTLDR; similarities between GME and BBBY runs could mean an explosive week coming up, strap your belts.",
