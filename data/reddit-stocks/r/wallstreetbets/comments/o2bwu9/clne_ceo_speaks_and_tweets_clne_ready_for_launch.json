During the interview Mr. Littlefair knocked it out of the park but also alluded to something Amazon wants to say about their deal.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htY1t6F5QVU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htY1t6F5QVU</a></p>\n\n<p>As of right know we all know that Amazon is buying in big time with 20% stake in CLNE (🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀) at 13.4X/share, but what&#39;s left unsaid is from the horses mouth at Amazon. Mr. Littlefair mentioned that Amazon is going to have something to say which is fair to assume is rather positive news.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally Mr. Littlefair is active on Twitter and just dropped this bombshell (positive)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heard from  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TotalEnergies\">@TotalEnergies</a>  </p>\n\n<p>CEO today that they have sold all they&#39;re going to sell. They wanted to re-coup their original investment and they have. Still own a little over 20% of our outstanding shares. Our partnership with them remains <strong>firm and deep</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/A_Littlefair/status/1405672450902269955?s=20\">https://twitter.com/A_Littlefair/status/1405672450902269955?s=20</a></p>\n\n<p>So what does this mean? Well, it appears Total Energies won&#39;t be dragging the fucking price down and now the $13 price point that was important for gamma considerations (🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀) has a higher probability for tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>(ETA: I&#39;m aware of NrdRage&#39;s DD and his suggestions on other considerations, feel free to peruse his big dick energy DD <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos_cow_farts_and_you_how_amzns_deal_w_clne_is/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos_cow_farts_and_you_how_amzns_deal_w_clne_is/</a> )</p>\n\n<p>🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚</p>\n\n<p>Well, I like the fucking stock (and my $9 calls) so I&#39;m holding and buying a little more. What do you do? That&#39;s up to you.</p>\n\n<p>So what does everyone else think of the interview and the revelation by the CEO about Total Energies movement with their holdings in CLNE?</p>\n\n<p>🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚</p>\n\n<p>ETA: I was doing some light reading and thought that this was important to include.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.act-news.com/news/propane-autogas-provides-energy-supply-resiliency/\">https://www.act-news.com/news/propane-autogas-provides-energy-supply-resiliency/</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll give my opinion of what the article says.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially what they&#39;re saying is that resilience and diversification in the energy and vehicle markets are paramount for not just your everyday person and the environment but also our (or any nations) national security. However the argument in the article is for Natural Gas and not for Renewable Natural Gas that CLNE provides via 🐄 💨 and because of that glaring oversight I believe the article falls short. </p>\n\n<p>That said the articles premise can be applied to and expanded and improved upon with RNG which CLNE provides. We can&#39;t remain beholden to either fossil fuels or battery tech in order move freight and goods across the roads. CLNE is fortunately uniquely poised to provide not just proof of concept with RNG but bringing their product to scale in short order and making our country (and any country that would adopt the tech and infrastructure) stronger and safer for it.  </p>\n\n<p>So... 🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚 </p>\n\n<p>🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
