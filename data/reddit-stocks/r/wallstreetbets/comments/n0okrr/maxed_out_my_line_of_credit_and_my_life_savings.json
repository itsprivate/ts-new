Here&#39;s the kicker, I live in Toronto, Canada. If you want a detached house that&#39;s not a meth den, you need to either : be making 6 figures, be a mega-frugal buzz-kill for years, have rich parents, or have a very successful only fans. But here&#39;s where my superpower kicks in: im cripplingly retarded, im so retarded that i should be sterilized so i never re-produce. I took the roughly 50k that I had saved up from living at home with my parents until I was 27 like some dirty man-child goblin feeding off of Cheez-Its crumbs and Frozen Pizzas, and, I took another ~30k from my Line of Credit to YOLO $MNMD, an at the time an OTC Schedule 1 drug company. This was all the DD I did:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>googled shroom stock companies, $MNMD was one of the biggest with by far the most pipelines for FDA approval,** lizard brain activated** more chances for success i guess or some shit</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve done every drug below the Injectable tier, MDMA, Shrooms, LSD etc\nLogo and website cool <strong>ape brain engaged</strong></li>\n<li>i wish i was kidding but thats it, there is no more bullet points, it took about 35 minutes of googling to YOLO $80k, every penny i had to my name.\nI bought in last December and on multiple occasions I&#39;ve had the ability to sell and finally buy my own place and start building equity, but then i&#39;ll just be house poor for 25 years. I always knew this was going to be a long hold. If you&#39;ve ever done shrooms or molly, you know what it&#39;s like, you shouldn&#39;t need convincing to invest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>that should be your DD</strong></p>\n\n<p>then i found the mindmed subreddit where i met mere Gods amongst mortals posting price targets, DD&#39;s, Quality Memes. Things i look at and pretend i know what they mean. I knew i found my home, and all the posts further reinforced my conviction in this company. I just hid there lurking since before 1000 members. i&#39;ve been up hugely, i&#39;ve been down hugely as well.</p>\n\n<p>The one intangible thing i can&#39;t shake is the gut feeling that somehow my Autism will prevail, i may have finally weaponized it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The way i look at it is this is my lifes lottery, this is my DFV moment, one attempt to gap up my social class or relegate to being lower middle class for the rest of my life &quot;Get Rich or $ROPE trying &quot; - 50 cent</strong></p>\n\n<p>If i do lose it all, well at least i was invested in something where the goal is the betterment of individuals like me, fellow retards. And i&#39;ll be able to sleep at night knowing that. Also my loss porn will fuel my masturbatory sessions for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>if i had this money in literally any other stock a 10% dip and I&#39;d paperhand and $ROPE but for some reason with $MNMD, it just feels like for once im very very early to something, i always look at shit like $SHOP $TSLA $WEED and go , if only i would have bought x amount back in y ,</p>\n\n<p><strong>pics for proof</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/5R1FsE7\">https://imgur.com/a/5R1FsE7</a></p>\n\n<p>Link to the DD that made me confident i&#39;m in the right company for the right reasons</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzxtz5/mnmd_starter_due_diligence/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link\">https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzxtz5/mnmd_starter_due_diligence/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link</a></p>\n\n<p>🚀🚀🚀to the fucking moon, or back to my parents basement to allow my virginity to grow back and my wizard powers to activate🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
