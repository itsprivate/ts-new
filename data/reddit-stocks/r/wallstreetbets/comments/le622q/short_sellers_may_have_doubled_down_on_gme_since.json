That&#39;s a TON. Furthermore if you do the same comparison for Monday this week to Thursday the outperformance of GVIP rises to approximately 4.4%, for Monday-Friday the outperformance was 2.3%</p>\n\n<p>To put this into perspective look at the historical performance of these two side by side since Jan 1st 2017 (essentially inception of GVIP) and you can see that GVIP in the past has modestly outperformed the s&amp;p 500 with GVIP returning on average (roughly) 1.69% per month and the S&amp;P 500 returning on average (roughly) 1.12% per month (A total of 127% gain for GVIP and a 73% gain for S&amp;P 500 over ~49 months). 2%+ out performance over a short period of time (a week or less) is massive variance to the long term monthly averages.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ygm5yajozwf61.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9000948cfa0326740c27e4dc98118d416441906\">https://preview.redd.it/ygm5yajozwf61.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9000948cfa0326740c27e4dc98118d416441906</a></p>\n\n<p>My hypothesis here: Hedge funds have been increasing short bets (on gamestop and other stocks) and plowing the cash they are receiving from the short sales into their favorite stocks. This pumps GVIP higher explains some of the difference in short term performance</p>\n\n<p><strong>#2: Short Volume has increased as a percent of total volume</strong></p>\n\n<p>First up its important that I note the different between short VOLUME and short INTEREST. Short volume refers to the number of shares sold/bought in short trades each day. Short interest is the total outstanding number of shorted shares.</p>\n\n<p>A large increase in short volume as a percent of total volume indicates that something is going on. As you can see from the chart below this new activity started on 12/27 (the day that gamestop had the highest price) and continued. While its hard to tell what is actually going on here it looks like there has been a paradigm change</p>\n\n<p>My thesis/opinion: Short sellers have been doubling down with the recent price increases. A combination of a high amount of short selling (as a percent of total volume) and lower liquidity is fueling the current price drop</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rcw6z3sc0xf61.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ff189db2a4d6483326048cb5aaff889097b54e6\">Data from the FINRA website</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>#3: Price changes in gamestop stock seem to be strategically timed with short interest reports</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every 15 days the SEC requires shorts sellers to report their positions. This information is then made public 7 days later. It just so happens that 1/29 was the reporting date for short interest (to be published 2/9). I&#39;ve placed 4pm on 1/29 on a chart of gamestop below:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7wf4nfhg0xf61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dbefb85fe92c694ca2765112c8c64fdac48eac0\">https://preview.redd.it/7wf4nfhg0xf61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dbefb85fe92c694ca2765112c8c64fdac48eac0</a></p>\n\n<p>My opinion: Short sellers want to give the impression that they closed their positions - so that we get paper hands. To do this they exited (or pretended to exit by substituting their positions for naked sold call options) leading up to the reporting deadline. Now they may have started to re-enter those positions</p>\n\n<p><strong>#4: Anecdotal evidence</strong></p>\n\n<p>4a: People have been posting screencaps to this subreddit that shows overwhelming good sentiment for gamestop stock. One of the things I&#39;ve seen pop up on this sub lately is the total volume of buy/sell orders from retail brokerages. These have been skewing very positive still. If its not the retail investors selling, then it must be institutions either exiting long positions or starting new short positions</p>\n\n<p>4b: The diamond hands on WSB are real, and sentiment has been fairly positive (despite sub drama, and a massive price drop)</p>\n\n<p>4c: It appears there is a continued effort to spread disinformation and to keep the stock price down. Anyone seen those advertisements for silver lately? Why would someone go to all this effort if short positions have been exited?</p>\n\n<p>4d: S3 partners estimate of short interest (as of about 7pm on 2/4) is around 26MM shares (see below). This is down from the official short interest number on 1/15 of 61MM shares. If we truly underwent a short squeeze, would half of them still be here?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f9j635jt0xf61.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9581436ed635e04f42f0e261350d0a7963a18ba\">https://preview.redd.it/f9j635jt0xf61.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9581436ed635e04f42f0e261350d0a7963a18ba</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>#5: Interactive Brokers Short Interest Data on 2/5</strong></p>\n\n<p>On Friday (2/05) morning we experienced a big jump in gamestop&#39;s stock price (to around $82 by 10am). Around the same time the short share availability dropped over 1MM shares at interactive brokers for gamestop.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vc38orqv1xf61.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b86977a889343bd18c9b01d56d22ec6d33d01a\">The first column is the borrowing cost, second column is number of shares available</a></p>\n\n<p>My Thesis: While short share availability can drop for a number of reasons (and there is no requirement to immediately sell borrowed shares) its my opinion that that someone borrowed a bunch of shares from interactive brokers and shorted the morning&#39;s spike which halted momentum in the stock price</p>\n\n<p>_____</p>\n\n<p>TLDR:</p>\n\n<p>My opinion: What we experienced the other day was a half baked short squeeze, the game isn&#39;t over and shorts are still playing. However, these shorts may have taken positions at higher prices and lower borrowing rates (see above screenshot) and therefore may be harder for gamestop to shake.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Big shoutout to the mods: Thanks <a href=\"/u/swedish_chef_bork_x3\">u/swedish_chef_bork_x3</a> for helping me get this posted</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimers and related positions I hold:</p>\n\n<p>This is not investment advice, please make sure to do your own due diligence before placing any trades.
