After investing heavily in  personnel, technology, inventory and supply chain infrastructure over  the past 18 months, our focus is on achieving sustained profitability.  This means eliminating excess costs and operating with an intense  owner’s mentality. Everyone in the organization must become even more  hands-on and embrace a heightened level of accountability for results.\n\nWith that said, I’m getting in touch today to share three organizational updates:\n\n1. After  making more than 600 corporate hires in 2021 and the first half of  2022, we have a stronger understanding of our transformation needs. This  has positioned us to right-size headcount across several corporate  departments. Today, we’re making a number of reductions to help us keep  things simple and operate nimbly with the right talent in place.\n2. We’re  going to be making a significant investment in our Store Leaders and  field employees, who play a critical role fulfilling the needs of our  customers. These individuals are, in many respects, the heart of  GameStop. We’ll be sharing details regarding this investment in the  coming weeks.\n3. Mike  Recupero, who has served as our Chief Financial Officer since last  June, is departing. Diana Jajeh, who has been our Chief Accounting  Officer and possesses strong institutional knowledge of the business,  has been appointed Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThese  changes will enable us to operate in a profitable manner as we execute  against our strategy of pursuing sales growth in our commerce business  and launching new products that empower customers within the digital  asset and web3 gaming verticals. I’m confident in the team we have in  place going forward, and thank you again for your continued dedication  and focus.\n\nRegards, Matt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredit to u/njiin12 for original post",
