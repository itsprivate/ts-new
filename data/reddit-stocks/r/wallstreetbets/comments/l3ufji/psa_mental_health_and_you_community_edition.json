I haven’t seen anything like it.</p>\n\n<p>Last week was exhausting (and I was mainly just watching...)</p>\n\n<p>No doubt people are drained from stress, flying, falling, fear, ecstasy. This is especially true if you’ve partaken in drugs, alcohol, sex. No judgement, I just want you to do your laundry after the ecstasy to prepare for whatever is to come. Blood or angels. </p>\n\n<p>Many no doubt have wins and losses, and there is a huge amount of depletion that occurs inside of the brain and body after serious events. People need to refuel.

Try for 3 things, even if you are down. </p></li>\n<li><p>Search your maps for a float therapy (“isolation tank”, “floating”, “sensory deprivation”). This usually costs $70 and is a pinnacle experience. Trust me.

It has no boundaries. You need to have a fresh mind and body to take on the volatility and pure Gs of a rocket ship. It is abso-fucking-lutely terrifying for some people. Whatever plays you’re making, please go into the coming week with a clear mind. I especially recommend floating in a sensory deprivation tank. </p>\n\n<p>Share your ideas in the comments, and when inspired, go do that thing. Please. For yourself. 👊</p>\n\n<p>God speed, retards 🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
