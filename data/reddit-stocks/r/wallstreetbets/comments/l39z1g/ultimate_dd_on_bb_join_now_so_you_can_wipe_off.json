  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Listen up.. “If you think BB moon’d after this week, you’re a rough brained retard. Our astronauts John Chen and Tom Eacobacci are literally in the break room; Chen’s unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife, Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he’s going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023. Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie... the point is, rocket is still fucking grounded. I repeat, the rocket is grounded.</p>\n\n<p>Listen retards, did you miss AMD? Did you miss NVDA? Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin? Hell, did you even miss TSLA? Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking “GeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy”</p>\n\n<p>Pro tip: they never came down...</p>\n\n<p>These rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth, living a shitty wage life flipping burgers, while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs, sunglasses on, and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun... FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING, SUN... this is the present state of affairs.</p>\n\n<p>There is, lucky you, however, another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK.</p>\n\n<p>Current position: missionary with 10,555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls. I’m holding unrealized profits of about $110k and realized profits of about $100k.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life... I will tell you two things: 1, not getting my wife her bf earlier on, and 2, booking $100k profit too soon in BB.</p>\n\n<p>May Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness. Learn from me. Buy and walk away. Buy and hold. Do not be tempted to sell before the moon. To not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Moon is $50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS, MOON CAN EASILY BE $100+ IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS, ECONOMIC MOAT, and a $450-750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey &amp; Company’s report on Monetizing Auto Data. Yes that’s not a mistake, the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as $750 BILLION in 2030. This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls. QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals. This was always the master plan for the turnaround. We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history.</p>\n\n<p>Listen, I don’t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening:</p>\n\n<p>Ask yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie?</p>\n\n<p>You wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you’re doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... anyways, now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today.</p>\n\n<p>And guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it’s the same company that’s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth.</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry. It’s Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys.</p>\n\n<p>“whAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet”</p>\n\n<p>Listen retards, BlackBerry’s MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?</p>\n\n<p>Because what’s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They’re actually in the fucking auto business.</p>\n\n<p>You think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is?</p>\n\n<p>Let me demonstrate with the ol’ lemonade stand analogy. Let’s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You’re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, your girl and her bf.</p>\n\n<p>You need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy’s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do?</p>\n\n<p>NO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you’re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that’s why.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of lemonade...</p>\n\n<p>“wHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?”</p>\n\n<p>Andrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the lemonade moat:</p>\n\n<p>Listen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don’t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear “DD”</p>\n\n<p>BlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they’re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don’t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain.</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market.</p>\n\n<p>Also this is a tough fucking market. Cars are one of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn’t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you’re dead.</p>\n\n<p>Are you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry’s moat is so secure?</p>\n\n<p>Cylance has just been integrated into QNX and was shown off at CES. How many of you missed that fine detail?</p>\n\n<p>Not only does QNX now act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially.</p>\n\n<p>Automakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.</p>\n\n<p>Remember when Chen said: “when better days come, we’ll be ready to execute”</p>\n\n<p>Better days are here. This is what he was talking about. They’ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.”</p>\n\n<p>Credits fo the DD: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ktg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ktg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
