We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don&#39;t know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who &quot;just like the stock&quot;, or those that say sell because they are &quot;shills&quot; or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. What happens here might influence the market, but I&#39;ve seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price. Don&#39;t put in what you can&#39;t risk to lose; it isn&#39;t worth it.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - If you want to buy - buy. If you want to hold - hold. If you want to sell - sell. But for fuck&#39;s sake be careful.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
