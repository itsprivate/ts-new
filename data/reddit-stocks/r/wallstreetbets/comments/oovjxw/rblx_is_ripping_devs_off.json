I have 200M+ total visits (visits work like youtube views) and made $250k usd from roblox in the past year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n If you're a boomer, roblox is not a game, it's more of a marketplace/app store. Developers make games, players buy robux and spend them in games, developers convert the robux to usd. Roblox charges the standard fee of 30% on all robux transactions between players. The part  where they rip devs off, is how much USD they get from robux. If you buy robux, then convert that robux back to USD, you will not get the same amount you paid, even before the 30% tax.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Let's calculate how much roblox actually takes. If you spend $100 on robux, you will get 10,000 robux. After you spend all the robux in a game, the developer will get 7,000 robux after 30% tax. The current robux to usd rate is 100,000 robux for $350, with a minimum of 100,000 to cash out. That means the developer ends up with $24.50 from a player spending $100 in their game. Roblox is taking a 75.5% cut on robux earnings, compared to 30% on Steam or Apple app store. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n It gets worse, some devs aren't able to convert their robux to usd at all. Developers must be approved before they can convert robux. Even if all the robux came from legitimate means, some devs aren't accepted. This is an issue with roblox contractors (smaller developers who do commission work) and they can only get around that by accepting PayPal.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n What does this mean? Roblox is making bank off their developers, and the developers are fine with it. Lots of the developers are kids (under 18) and many from third world countries, so money has more value to them. Developers also fear the competition on other app stores where there are already established game dev companies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy position: [2000 shares at $86.45](https://prnt.sc/1e15x8u)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Roblox takes 75.5% of earnings on robux from devs, devs don't care.
