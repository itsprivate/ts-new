This DD is split into 8 parts, so feel free to jump to whichever section you’re most interested in.\n\n**Part 1 – Introduction**\n\n**Part 2 – Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n**Part 3 – Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Part 4 – Recent Updates**\n\n**Part 5 – Financials and Valuation**\n\n**Part 6 – Bear Case**\n\n**Part 7 – SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\n**Part 8 – TL;DR**\n\n**Part 1 – Introduction**\n\nIt was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason – **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day – GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the ‘meme mania’ we’ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. \n\nWhy’d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there’s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD’s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for ‘meme stocks’ which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don’t know, haven’t investigated that particular theory but there’s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you’re so inclined. \n\nThe quick point I’m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question – and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule – seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems – for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**\n\n**Part 2 – Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* From an investment into equities point of view – S&P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month — other than a slight dip in February — over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) \n\n* Let’s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it’s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   \n\n* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) \n\n* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). \n\n* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\n* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. \n\n* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) \n\n* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) \n\n* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  \n\n* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois’ clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). \n\n* By 2030, there’s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market. [link](https://gyazo.com/66173e4431b4c6b30ac7ed0662f13f1c) \n\n**Part 2 – Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Before we look into what’s happened since my last post, let’s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. \n\nIt is this modular platform that led to Apple’s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).\n\nApple wasn’t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia’s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as ‘pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal… Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company’ [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). \n\nUltimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo’s chairman didn’t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn’t factor in the value of Canoo’s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo’s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) \n\nRegarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo’s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).\n\nLet’s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo’s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). \n\nThe use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It’s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants\n\n* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nThese enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo’s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 – layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) \n\nThe three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:\n\nLifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It’s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I’d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Launching late 2022.\n\n* Starting at $34,750*\n\n* 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats\n\n* 250 mi range\n\n* Up to 350 Horsepower \n\n* 28min charge time 80%\n\n* 188 ft³ interior volume\n\n* 80 KWh battery\n\n* 1,464 lbs payload – 2,000 lbs capacity\n\nMulti-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) – Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Starting at $33,000*\n\n* 200 ft³ - 500 ft³ cargo volume\n\n* 130 – 230 mi, 90 – 190 mi range (EPA)\n\n* 1,540 to 1,980 lbs\n\nPickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) – All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility — ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Launching as early as 2023.\n\n* Price – Not currently listed, but during the Q&A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category – you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  \n\n* Targeted HP – 500+\n\n* Payload Capacity – 1800 lbs\n\n* Range – 200+ mi\n\n* Powertrain – AWD or RWD\n\nThere’s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn’t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). \n\nWe can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It’s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity – highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). \n\nCanoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer – with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 – 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).\n\nTo sum it up – Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).\n\n**Part 4 – Recent Updates**\n\n**Now let’s take a look at some of the hires that the company’s been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).\n\nPartnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US & EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar ‘is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities.

Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) \n\n* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) \n\n* Bank of America - $5 (can’t find the article at the moment but I’m sure I’ve seen it somewhere)\n\nAverage = $13, current SP = $6.7\n\nAs of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). \n\nThe company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.\n\nAt a pre-revenue stage there’s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:\n\n* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders – which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).\n\n* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).\n\nAs far as valuations go, let’s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look – based on their market cap. I’m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I’ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.\n\n* Lucid Motors – $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021\n\n* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 \n\n* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, >17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 \n\n* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 \n\n* Canoo – $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV \n\n* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B\n\nJust looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven’t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there’s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo’s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  \n\n**Part 6 – Bear Case**\n\nWith anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that’s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I’m on the bullish side for the company, I’ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won’t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market – these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I’ll summarize them below:\n\n* As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. \n\n* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.\n\n* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.\n\n* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production – H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn’t make much sense to go the additional equity route.\n\n* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) – nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.\n\n**Part 7 – SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI know y’all have just been waiting for this so I’ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that’ll help understand GOEV’s squeezability.\n\n* Short Interest – 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float \n\n* Market Cap – $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it’s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital\n\n* Extremely Memeable – I mean… GOEV, like Go… EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria\n\n* Low Liquidity – Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)\n\n* Low Risk (IV) – Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you’re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it’s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There’s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn’t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I’d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.\n\n**Part 8 – TL;DR**\n\nThe global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. \n\nPresident Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at <$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. \n\nCanoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.\n\nTo facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)\n\n* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nIf we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it’s $4,000 rebate – that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you’re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.\n\nIf you made it this far, I’d like to thank you for reading this – I’d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won’t). They’re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company – from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups. Y’all the real MVPs. Position – 1k shares @ 11.69.",

Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there’s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD’s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for ‘meme stocks’ which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don’t know, haven’t investigated that particular theory but there’s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you’re so inclined. </p>\n\n<p>The quick point I’m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question – and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. <strong>GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule – seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems – for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2 – Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>From an investment into equities point of view – S&amp;P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month — other than a slight dip in February — over the past half century <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html\">link</a>. However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022\">link</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Let’s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 <a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market\">source</a>. This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y\">source 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html\">source 2</a>, another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it’s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html\">source 3</a>.   </p></li>\n<li><p>Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html\">link</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. <a href=\"https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx\">link</a>. </p></li>\n<li><p>As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan\">link</a></p></li>\n<li><p>President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/\">link 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/\">link 2</a> which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. </p></li>\n<li><p>EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/\">link</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html\">link</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/\">link</a>  </p></li>\n<li><p>States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov.

Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747\">link</a>. What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. </p>\n\n<p>It is this modular platform that led to Apple’s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev\">link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Apple wasn’t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia’s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia\">link</a>. This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as ‘pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal… Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company’ <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia\">link</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo’s chairman didn’t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn’t factor in the value of Canoo’s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo’s own vehicles to commercial operators <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev\">link</a> </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo’s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. <a href=\"https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video\">link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo’s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb\">link</a>, currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c\">link</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c\">link</a>, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It’s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed</p></li>\n<li><p>57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants</p></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n<p>70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e\">link</a>, and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo’s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 – layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8\">link</a>. This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977\">link</a> </p>\n\n<p>The three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:</p>\n\n<p>Lifestyle vehicle <a href=\"https://www.canoo.com/canoo/\">link</a> - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It’s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I’d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Launching late 2022.</p></li>\n<li><p>Starting at $34,750*</p></li>\n<li><p>2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats</p></li>\n<li><p>250 mi range</p></li>\n<li><p>Up to 350 Horsepower </p></li>\n<li><p>28min charge time 80%</p></li>\n<li><p>188 ft³ interior volume</p></li>\n<li><p>80 KWh battery</p></li>\n<li><p>1,464 lbs payload – 2,000 lbs capacity</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Multi-purpose Delivery Vehicle <a href=\"https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/\">link</a> – Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Starting at $33,000*</p></li>\n<li><p>200 ft³ - 500 ft³ cargo volume</p></li>\n<li><p>130 – 230 mi, 90 – 190 mi range (EPA)</p></li>\n<li><p>1,540 to 1,980 lbs</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pickup <a href=\"https://www.canoo.com/pickup/\">link</a> – All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility — ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Launching as early as 2023.</p></li>\n<li><p>Price – Not currently listed, but during the Q&amp;A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category – you can check it out at the following link <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908\">link</a>  </p></li>\n<li><p>Targeted HP – 500+</p></li>\n<li><p>Payload Capacity – 1800 lbs</p></li>\n<li><p>Range – 200+ mi</p></li>\n<li><p>Powertrain – AWD or RWD</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There’s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn’t been listed anywhere officially but was found by <a href=\"/u/Mcardiel007\">/u/Mcardiel007</a> when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933\">pic 1</a>, <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c\">pic 2</a>, <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a\">pic 3</a>, <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a\">pic 4</a>, <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714\">pic 5</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4\">link</a>. It’s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity – highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda\">link</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Canoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer – with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 – 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f\">link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To sum it up – Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe\">link</a>, developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 4 – Recent Updates</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now let’s take a look at some of the hires that the company’s been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar\">link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Partnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US &amp; EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar ‘is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.” The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 <a href=\"https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner\">link</a></p>\n\n<p>De-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece\">link</a>, with highlights including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><blockquote>\n<p>$250M invested in Beta</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>~1.5M hours of engineering</p></li>\n<li><p>~500k miles of testing</p></li>\n<li><p>13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested</p></li>\n<li><p>US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Undertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce\">link</a>, with key highlights including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><blockquote>\n<p>12 months of testing</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated</p></li>\n<li><p>~70 crash tests</p></li>\n<li><p>30 sled tests</p></li>\n<li><p>Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts</p></li>\n<li><p>80% of all components are sourced</p></li>\n<li><p>63% of all engineering is released</p></li>\n<li><p>54% of tooling is committed</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Partnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military.

Lafferty - $19 <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124\">link</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>H.C. Wainright - $15 <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/\">link</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Bank of America - $5 (can’t find the article at the moment but I’m sure I’ve seen it somewhere)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Average = $13, current SP = $6.7</p>\n\n<p>As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million <a href=\"https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet\">link</a>, which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398\">link</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.</p>\n\n<p>At a pre-revenue stage there’s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Over 9,500 non-binding preorders – which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).</p></li>\n<li><p>10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As far as valuations go, let’s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look – based on their market cap. I’m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I’ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Lucid Motors – $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021</p></li>\n<li><p>Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 </p></li>\n<li><p>Fisker Inc - $3.917B, &gt;17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 </p></li>\n<li><p>Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 </p></li>\n<li><p>Canoo – $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV </p></li>\n<li><p>Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven’t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand <a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/\">source</a>, there’s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo’s cash on hand at $230M <a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/\">link</a>.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 6 – Bear Case</strong></p>\n\n<p>With anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that’s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I’m on the bullish side for the company, I’ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won’t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market – these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I’ll summarize them below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. </p></li>\n<li><p>Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.</p></li>\n<li><p>EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production – H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn’t make much sense to go the additional equity route.</p></li>\n<li><p>In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) – nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Part 7 – SI and Squeeze Potential</strong></p>\n\n<p>I know y’all have just been waiting for this so I’ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed <a href=\"/u/pennyether\">/u/pennyether</a>, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that’ll help understand GOEV’s squeezability.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Short Interest – 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float </p></li>\n<li><p>Market Cap – $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it’s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital</p></li>\n<li><p>Extremely Memeable – I mean… GOEV, like Go… EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria</p></li>\n<li><p>Low Liquidity – Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/\">link</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Low Risk (IV) – Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you’re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by <a href=\"/u/ChemaKyle\">/u/ChemaKyle</a> on how buying far OTM options and how it’s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There’s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn’t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I’d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Part 8 – TL;DR</strong></p>\n\n<p>The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. </p>\n\n<p>President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at &lt;$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. </p>\n\n<p>Canoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.</p>\n\n<p>To facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed</p></li>\n<li><p>57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)</p></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n<p>70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it’s $4,000 rebate – that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you’re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>If you made it this far, I’d like to thank you for reading this – I’d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won’t). They’re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company – from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups. Y’all the real MVPs. Position – 1k shares @ 11.69.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
