I’ll explain my theories and tell you how to make money off the possible outcomes. \n\nAs you all know there are a ton of call options that are ITM that weren’t supposed to be ITM this week. I don’t know about you but I don’t see this price action stopping this week so I’m actually going to exercise a few 100 strikes. I doubt I’m the only one because this baby is going to the moon.  \n\nWS is probably going to bring this heat tomorrow more ways than one but here’s how to how you make money and apply buying pressure. \n\nIt’s actually hilarious because I think their only way out is to cheat. \n\nMost likely scenario: I see an iv crush in the AM with no gap down to deter swing traders from buying in. This slow uptrend isn’t working for them today. Apes must have learned patience last year. There will be a de-hedging scenario in which market makers sell their shares (that they never bought…yet) because people with take profits on calls and not everyone has enough money to exercise them. It’s inevitable. This doesn’t change the fact that more calls will be bought but they will get people to paper hand. \n\nHow do you solve this? Clearly you buy OTM puts at the open to hedge your bullish position. This way market makers lose both ways, and the only other solution for them is to cover short positions, pay up on the puts or calls, or get dirty. Long story short…If they need it down then make them pay you for it. It’s ok if you lose money on puts i literally was up 70% on my long calls today and down 80% on my puts. I made no money but I’m prepared and I didn’t lose money. \n\nBest case scenario: as soon as think they won. Someone or institution buys a crap ton of shares, creating fomo again, retail starts buying more calls…WS panics and the road to ATH begins after hours.\n\n\nWorst case scenario: some fed propaganda comes out tanks the whole market and and Gme of course goes down with it on some illegal dark pool derivative Wall Street stuff (I mean, does it really matter right now?) guess what you bought puts and make more money then you would have on calls. \n\nI’m not talking about 0 day options here, at least 1-2 weeks out. I got 20 130 puts for 4/1 and and 60 250 call strikes for 4/14. \n\nAlso is it just me or is the We3d stock shit come back just on time - same as last year. Do you, but I don’t give a shit. Stay focused. You know what’s happening and you know the truth. \n\nTLDR: hedge OTM puts. Exercise calls. Hold. This is how normal folk can help. It’s actually more effective than buying shares rn since settlement takes 2 days but of course buy and hold. \n\nThis is not financial head lice 🫠",
