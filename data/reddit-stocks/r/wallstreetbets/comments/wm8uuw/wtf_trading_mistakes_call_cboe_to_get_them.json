  "selftext": "So, funny story I'd like to share here. I never knew this was something that's acceptable, let alone legal in America. So apparently, when someone buys something and they have buyer's remorse they can have a big-bully (such as Fidelity) go beat up the seller (me) and just forcefully take the money back and give back the traded item. I never knew this was an acceptable and legal thing.\n\nIn this case an option contract that I sold for $5 at 10:19 am today was then forcefully returned 4 hours later to me after which point (because it's 0 DTE) you couldn't even market sell for $.05 to close because of 0 bids. They bought a vase from me, got pissed and had a buyer's remorse, went to the big bully who agreed with him, and then brought me worthless broken vase, had the big bully beat the living shit out of and take my money to give back to him.\n\nI made a transaction earlier today.\n\n10 SPX 8/11 $4280c was sold for $5 a pop as follows through Fidelity at 10:19 am EST:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c71hoz7cv6h91.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5965566632cd329ac1b2d267aeb8ba49c1b4cae\n\nI had 20 of these contracts that I bought for sale for $.85 a pop, and had 10 for sale at a limit price of $5 a pop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvtdiekyv6h91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df2971d1389069f946513d90aa61a21d57570bc2\n\nAnd then about 4 hours after the sale, Fidelity reversed the transaction. They debited my account $5k ($500 x 10 contracts) and gave me back the contracts that had a bid/ask of $0/$.05 as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[WTF?!](https://preview.redd.it/shkjr48ov6h91.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=276976bf4b256b331d0e22d58acaea9b35f062c2)\n\nFidelity beat the shit out of me, turned me into a bloody pulp, and then had the previous buyer effectively pee on me and give me back a worthless broken thing that I couldn’t even sell for a penny to anyone.\n\nJustice of course can be served right? MAYBE? Of course, story gets sadder in reality. I call Fidelity. They tell me straight up (well after holding and talking with them for 2 hours) that, “CBOE sent an industry wide letter saying that these specific orders were busted and must be reversed”. From here, our friend from Fidelity tells me that they cannot do anything and that I must be happy with the broken vase and should be grateful that the erroneous trade was caught and reversed. And he proceeds to tell me that “Imagine if you were on the other side of that trade, wouldn’t you want the trades be reversed??”. What he said boiled down to this, the price I received was an “unfair” price that’s completely out of the norm because the contract “never traded that high again” and so it had to be reversed out.\n\nYeah buddy, I can also totally imagine how the trade went. Some moron basically fat fingered and market bought, which effectively cleared out everything all the way up the chain to not only hit my limit prices but even double that. As so:\n\nSo this rich fucker (I’m assuming, yes, but we are talking about 205 contracts that were very likely bought by this same person at exactly 10:19:39 AM EST, nobody poor has that kind of money to throw on 0 DTE SPX contracts) fucked up, and then he had the gall to call his friends at CBOE, who he probably has martinis with during lunch, and asked them please reverse them. Which they happily obliged. 4 hours AFTER the transaction. What’s even funnier is I was debited $5k and given 10 of the said contracts with no cost basis.\n\nIF someone rich can just have their trading mistakes reversed like this when they fuck up, how are we supposed to trust out limit prices? Better yet, what about everybody’s market order fuck ups here? Apparently you can go back and have them reversed because of “unfair” pricing for your dumbassery. If this guy had his transaction reversed why not you or me?\n\nAlright now I’m looking at you Fidelity. How can you have customers believe your order history or even anything you say to them now. And here I thought you were one of the “better” customer oriented ones from the industry. Fuck you is all I can say. You just stole $5k from me. I write this to as a sad and cautionary tale to you retards not to deal with Fidelity. I still have the fucking worthless contracts sitting in my account right now. Gdamnit I need a drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: someone (very likely rich and connected) fucked up and made a market order on a very very illiquid financial instrument, i.e. options contract, and then very likely had their friends at CBOE reverse the transaction and left me holding the $5k bag. Fuck Fidelity.",
