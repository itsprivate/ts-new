  "selftext": "TMC (The Metals Company) is a recent \"de-SPA C\" that started trading on Friday. It's a deep seas mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9 - $10 range).\n\nThe key here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million Pipe shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).\n\nOkay, so why dow we care? Here's why this is potentially one of the most explosive stocke we've ever seen this week:\n\nThe curren float is 2.72 million becasue 91% of the original 30 million shares redeemed for cash.\n\nThe short interest is around 1.77 million shares(or roughly 65% of the current float is short).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut here's the \"canary in the coal mine\": the open interest. Market makers were selling calls based on prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've solde much more than the entrie current float:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/823tys3ci9n71.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=493a7a66e8ffbe60cf7c4ae599e422c9b9779f09](https://preview.redd.it/823tys3ci9n71.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=493a7a66e8ffbe60cf7c4ae599e422c9b9779f09)\n\nThere are 25k calls for Friday 17 of september between $10 and $12.50.\n\nThat's 2.5 million shares.\n\nThere's another 8.2k calls for Friday 17 of september between $14 and $15\n\nThat's another 820k shares\n\n**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls. If it's over $15 by Friday, MM's will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**\n\nThat's just September. Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...\n\n**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls**\n\n(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).\n\nI'm gonna be honest, **credits to** u/MillennialBets and  [u/zg44](https://www.reddit.com/user/zg44/) **,** it is his DD, but it got deleted due to the market cap. Now the market cap is large enough fort r/wallstreetbets.\n\nI have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SPACs recently is unprecedented).
