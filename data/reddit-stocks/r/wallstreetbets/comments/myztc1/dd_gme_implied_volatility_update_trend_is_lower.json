Every week or so I&#39;ve been keeping track of option prices at different strikes.  When GME first lifted off to the Moon the market was pricing a dramatic move within 1 week.  When it was at $325 around the end of January the 1 week move was plus or minus 40%.  That means a 1 week option at a strike of $325 cost about $130.  As you can see in this chart, the options market is not pricing in a big move anytime soon.  The expected $ movement week to week has been getting smaller and smaller.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vr9m0ff98jv61.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d39ec5abcaf2a85d2238fc9e517d56c899825e8\">Call Option Data.  Source: I personally gather it on those dates through Etrade.</a></p>\n\n<p>What do we do with this information?  If you own shares or options then you can feel a little more comfortable that it&#39;s not going to drop to $50 overnight as CNBC would have you believe.  They parade idiots on their shows as Analysts (aka experts).  Keep in mind they are experts of history and have no predictive value.  Same for most people.  You could buy some insurance by buying longer dated call spreads in the $80 - $100 range as they are cheap right now.   Also, keep in mind as I stated in my previous post that the cheaper options b/c the more ability retail has to control the price through aggressive buying of shares and options.  Gamma pressure easier to manifest.  If the stock ever does drop below $100 I imagine the out of the money call options will be relatively cheap at first which could be a good buying opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone is waiting to hear the transformation plan led by Ryan Cohen.  The first sign of that may be on the June earnings call.  </p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t update this every week but when I see a change in trend or a big move in IV maybe I&#39;ll post again.  Good luck!! 🚀💎 🙌</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.  blah blah</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
