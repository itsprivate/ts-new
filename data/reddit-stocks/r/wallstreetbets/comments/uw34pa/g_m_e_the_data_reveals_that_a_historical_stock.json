  "selftext": "# Big Picture Discussion\n\nAs the [wealth shock](https://www.yahoo.com/now/5-trillion-wealth-shock-cracking-132734925.html) (and market crash) that I predicted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tsa8t7/yield_curve_stagflation_fed_rate_hikes_world_war/) is taking place, seasoned investors are watching for the ultimate capitulation. Whether it's a series of hedge funds going bankrupt, or at least some financial entities going to zero, the market bottom will likely take some time.\n\nAs has been seen in the inflationary crisis in the seventies, which led to a falling market in 1973 and 1974, there were several upward fibonacci retracements (rips) that were met with all out selling. The result was continued discouragement and loss of trust in the market.  The 2020 and 2021 idea of \"buy the dips\" will likely become a forgotten phenomenon, and will probably become bad advice going forward.\n\nOne investor pointed out that there's a correlation between the announcement of the gamestop stock dividend and the decline in the stock market, but there is also a correlation between the decline in the stock market and the Department of Justice investigation into short sellers, which was announced late last year.  Since then we have seen the fall of Archegos, the prosecution of its former leadership, we have seen the fall of Melvin Capitol, the fall of Allianz Officers and Securities Investors, and the new claim from Citadel Securities that they are considering \"leaving Chicago.\"  Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has not yet prosecuted the short sellers that it promised it would prosecute with racketeering charges. Thus, we can safely assume that this Beast is rolling behind the scenes of this historic 2022 stock market crash.\n\nOn the positive hand, you have ***GameStop Corporation***. GameStop has maintained its price well above its 2019 and 2020 price levels.  The short-medium term technical price is still in the $250 to $300 range, and the near term price reached as high as $508.44.  Against all odds, and against an Insidious level of short interest, GameStop is 'winning.'\n\nLet's take a look at where GameStop currently stands, from a technical standpoint, prior to discussing some of its newfound fundamentals going into the shareholder meeting in a few business days and subsequent ***stock dividend distribution*** to loyal shareholders.\n\n# Technicals\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Technicals Reveal a Double Bottom, Oversold \\[RSI\\], and the beginning of a return of Volume and Money Flows on the daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/w42t9fa6r8191.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84c2b0177bd6d80721fd93f788cbce47d91df545)\n\n# Artificial intelligence\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A.I. showing a new buy signal on the daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/jntxekglr8191.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52b276ace16f7d11600dc97aa820bec41765c7a3)\n\n# Short Interest - Ortex Data\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Shares on Loan is now approaching the January 2021 Peak.  Utilization has been at 100&amp;#37; for 73 days now, which is approaching the level just before the January 2021 Price Gain](https://preview.redd.it/porm52rmu8191.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=511c7959d8c67aa0b157cfcead39097aacf56402)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[💲 G M E short interest is now at about 25&amp;#37; as now a historic $1.5 Billion of short positions face the risk of unlimited losses upon a coming gain in share price.](https://preview.redd.it/0e1yahq9v8191.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27337e43bc47c8c145f9160666eeedc57fb0995c)\n\n# Cost to Borrow\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Questrade shows a jump in cost to borrow from 13.79&amp;#37; to 22.25&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/t2vst5z3u8191.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96573b9629667b8b0a8cf7919cece0ae1324aff5)\n\n# Stock Dividend Price Dynamics\n\nIt is widely believed that GameStop was excessively shorted prior to this stock dividend phenomenon. The same type of stock dividend phenomenon recently allowed Overstock to have a 52x gain in a matter of months, as well as Tesla to have an 18x gain in a matter of months. The chief executive officers of those two companies have stated that their primary intention of issuing those dividends was to destroy short sellers.  Knowing GameStop was historically the most shorted stock of all time, we can reasonably assume that we will achieve a similar scenario with GameStop stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fillable Price Chart to compare with Tesla's Stock Dividend Dynamics](https://preview.redd.it/bkvzztelv8191.png?width=1058&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff8c6d1b0c719b52483ddf67005d87ed62700edf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fillable Price Chart to compare with Overstock's Stock Dividend Dynamics](https://preview.redd.it/4ftbphsiv8191.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=686d0576821ebf171cf85ab31adf7b121b743a64)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Fundamentals not associated with the coming GameStop stock dividend\n\nGameStop [today released its wallett](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-price-crypto-wallet-nft-51653306946?siteid=yhoof2) for virtual / metaverse market payments and transactions.\n\nGameStop virtual Marketplace is now set to be released. This was promised in Q2 which is now only four weeks remaining.  It is also likely that there will be some GameStop officer-led discussion about this at the shareholder meeting in a few days.\n\nIncrease of retail sales due to inflationary price increases as well as the end of the pandemic. GameStop is now considered a technology company, first and foremost, as they are leading the metaverse and the world of digital sales. This too has a likelihood of changing the future for sales of products of all kinds and it could also set the stage for a new way to trade stocks using secure software on decentralized, distributed ledgers.\n\n# TLDR\n\n💲 G M E  Short interest is now 25% \\[only as reported, since other data shows 10x of the float is *likely* shorted\\], as now $1.5 Billion \\[*or perhaps $15 Billion*\\] in egregious short positions face the risk of unlimited losses.  Technicals reveal a completion of a 61% short term price decline that occurred on only positive corporate developments.  RSI, Money Flows, Volume Oscillation, and Artifical Intelligence are now indicating strong buy signals.\n\nConclusively, there is evidence to suggest that hedge funds short-attacked (in a final attempt) to get GameStop as low as possible before the price-gain dynamics of GameStop's stock dividend takes over.  This process is slated to begin in a few days, as the shareholder meeting will announce the Stock Dividend date of record.  On a similar stock dividend distribution, Tesla stock price increased by 1,800%, and Overstock increased by about 5,200% in only a matter of months.  Therefore, we can reasonably assume that GameStop could compete with these numbers, as GameStop's short interest has been shown to be much higher than those other stocks.  Fundamentals show the release today of the wallett for the metaverse assets, and the release of the metaverse marketplace is now ready for the second quarter release.",

Whether it&amp;#39;s a series of hedge funds going bankrupt, or at least some financial entities going to zero, the market bottom will likely take some time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As has been seen in the inflationary crisis in the seventies, which led to a falling market in 1973 and 1974, there were several upward fibonacci retracements (rips) that were met with all out selling. The result was continued discouragement and loss of trust in the market.  The 2020 and 2021 idea of &amp;quot;buy the dips&amp;quot; will likely become a forgotten phenomenon, and will probably become bad advice going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One investor pointed out that there&amp;#39;s a correlation between the announcement of the gamestop stock dividend and the decline in the stock market, but there is also a correlation between the decline in the stock market and the Department of Justice investigation into short sellers, which was announced late last year.  Since then we have seen the fall of Archegos, the prosecution of its former leadership, we have seen the fall of Melvin Capitol, the fall of Allianz Officers and Securities Investors, and the new claim from Citadel Securities that they are considering &amp;quot;leaving Chicago.&amp;quot;  Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has not yet prosecuted the short sellers that it promised it would prosecute with racketeering charges. Thus, we can safely assume that this Beast is rolling behind the scenes of this historic 2022 stock market crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the positive hand, you have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop Corporation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. GameStop has maintained its price well above its 2019 and 2020 price levels.  The short-medium term technical price is still in the $250 to $300 range, and the near term price reached as high as $508.44.  Against all odds, and against an Insidious level of short interest, GameStop is &amp;#39;winning.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look at where GameStop currently stands, from a technical standpoint, prior to discussing some of its newfound fundamentals going into the shareholder meeting in a few business days and subsequent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stock dividend distribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to loyal shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Technicals&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w42t9fa6r8191.png?width=594&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=84c2b0177bd6d80721fd93f788cbce47d91df545\"&gt;Technicals Reveal a Double Bottom, Oversold [RSI], and the beginning of a return of Volume and Money Flows on the daily chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jntxekglr8191.png?width=946&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=52b276ace16f7d11600dc97aa820bec41765c7a3\"&gt;A.I. showing a new buy signal on the daily chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Short Interest - Ortex Data&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/porm52rmu8191.png?width=818&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=511c7959d8c67aa0b157cfcead39097aacf56402\"&gt;Shares on Loan is now approaching the January 2021 Peak.  Utilization has been at 100&amp;#37; for 73 days now, which is approaching the level just before the January 2021 Price Gain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0e1yahq9v8191.png?width=1074&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=27337e43bc47c8c145f9160666eeedc57fb0995c\"&gt;💲 G M E short interest is now at about 25&amp;#37; as now a historic $1.5 Billion of short positions face the risk of unlimited losses upon a coming gain in share price.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Cost to Borrow&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t2vst5z3u8191.png?width=600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=96573b9629667b8b0a8cf7919cece0ae1324aff5\"&gt;Questrade shows a jump in cost to borrow from 13.79&amp;#37; to 22.25&amp;#37;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Stock Dividend Price Dynamics&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that GameStop was excessively shorted prior to this stock dividend phenomenon. The same type of stock dividend phenomenon recently allowed Overstock to have a 52x gain in a matter of months, as well as Tesla to have an 18x gain in a matter of months. The chief executive officers of those two companies have stated that their primary intention of issuing those dividends was to destroy short sellers.  Knowing GameStop was historically the most shorted stock of all time, we can reasonably assume that we will achieve a similar scenario with GameStop stock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bkvzztelv8191.png?width=1058&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ff8c6d1b0c719b52483ddf67005d87ed62700edf\"&gt;Fillable Price Chart to compare with Tesla&amp;#39;s Stock Dividend Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4ftbphsiv8191.png?width=735&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=686d0576821ebf171cf85ab31adf7b121b743a64\"&gt;Fillable Price Chart to compare with Overstock&amp;#39;s Stock Dividend Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Fundamentals not associated with the coming GameStop stock dividend&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GameStop &lt;a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-price-crypto-wallet-nft-51653306946?siteid=yhoof2\"&gt;today released its wallett&lt;/a&gt; for virtual / metaverse market payments and transactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GameStop virtual Marketplace is now set to be released. This was promised in Q2 which is now only four weeks remaining.  It is also likely that there will be some GameStop officer-led discussion about this at the shareholder meeting in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Increase of retail sales due to inflationary price increases as well as the end of the pandemic. GameStop is now considered a technology company, first and foremost, as they are leading the metaverse and the world of digital sales. This too has a likelihood of changing the future for sales of products of all kinds and it could also set the stage for a new way to trade stocks using secure software on decentralized, distributed ledgers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;TLDR&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;💲 G M E  Short interest is now 25% [only as reported, since other data shows 10x of the float is &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; shorted], as now $1.5 Billion [&lt;em&gt;or perhaps $15 Billion&lt;/em&gt;] in egregious short positions face the risk of unlimited losses.  Technicals reveal a completion of a 61% short term price decline that occurred on only positive corporate developments.  RSI, Money Flows, Volume Oscillation, and Artifical Intelligence are now indicating strong buy signals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusively, there is evidence to suggest that hedge funds short-attacked (in a final attempt) to get GameStop as low as possible before the price-gain dynamics of GameStop&amp;#39;s stock dividend takes over.  This process is slated to begin in a few days, as the shareholder meeting will announce the Stock Dividend date of record.  On a similar stock dividend distribution, Tesla stock price increased by 1,800%, and Overstock increased by about 5,200% in only a matter of months.  Therefore, we can reasonably assume that GameStop could compete with these numbers, as GameStop&amp;#39;s short interest has been shown to be much higher than those other stocks.  Fundamentals show the release today of the wallett for the metaverse assets, and the release of the metaverse marketplace is now ready for the second quarter release.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
