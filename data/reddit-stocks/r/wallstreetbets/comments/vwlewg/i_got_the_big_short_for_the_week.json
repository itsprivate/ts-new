Pepsi is going to give some really bad news on future sales and supply chain issues.  \n\nThey also haven't really tanked in stock since the start of the pandemic.  With Inflation, there will also be talking point about how people are going to cut back on things like Soda.  The real victims in the stock market are not usually who you would think, they are the ones the tier below, like Pepsi.  By the time the inflation report comes out at 8.9% on Wednesday, it will be too late to short the bank stocks for later in the week.\n\nI'm calling a 25-50% drop on Pepsi by this time tomorrow.  I put everything I have including margin into this short, I hope I am worthy and will show my losses if I am wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/807qo7grlya91.png?width=430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=357789e434b7748457dd40c0f99a12b62e8a988f",
