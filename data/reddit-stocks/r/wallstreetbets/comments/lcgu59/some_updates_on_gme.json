I am long GME (216 shares cuz poor) and 💎✋ing.</p>\n\n<p>This post is for those of you who are new and asking about why people are still holding in this stock. It represents my personal opinion, often backed up by facts, but also including theorizing. This is all in addition to the original DD+updates, which can be viewed here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/\">One DD to Rule Them All</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gmedd.com\">www.gmedd.com</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer\">Further evidence that Gamestop is serious about this</a> (they hired some big players with the focus on customer service and digital sales)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.</h1>\n\n<p>Blah blah blah, what&#39;s the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)...then:</p>\n\n<p>EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That&#39;s INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that&#39;s an ADDITIONAL IOU.</p>\n\n<p>I literally can&#39;t overstate how insane this is. This isn&#39;t just a short squeeze where there aren&#39;t enough shares....there are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don&#39;t know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).</p>\n\n<p>Forget the moon....🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to some kind of permanent orbit.</p>\n\n<h1>2) Price movement during the meteoric rises</h1>\n\n<p>On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price <strong>SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share</strong>. Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM&#39;s covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one &quot;Kjetill Stjerne&quot; who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would &quot;hold the line&quot; in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like &quot;hunt=shortsells&quot;. While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don&#39;t know if he&#39;s actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.</p>\n\n<p>After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It&#39;s important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some options...but it&#39;s all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he&#39;s the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that&#39;s my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:</p>\n\n<h1>3) Broker Restrictions</h1>\n\n<p><strong>IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS</strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html\">INTERVIEW</a><strong>:</strong>  This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: &quot;We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses&quot;. In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having <strong>TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES</strong>. He also talked about how he &quot;saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses&quot;. So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro &quot;accidentally&quot; set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.</p>\n\n<h1>4) Media Manipulation</h1>\n\n<p>It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the &quot;short squeeze&quot; in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how &quot;reddit&quot; or the &quot;reddit army&quot; has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported that...but it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that &quot;the short squeeze has happened.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the &quot;new&quot; articles after doing a Google search of &quot;GME.&quot; You&#39;ll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly &quot;new&quot; (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the &quot;frenzy&quot;, WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I&#39;ve seen)</p>\n\n<h1>5) Bot accounts</h1>\n\n<p>There&#39;s been a massive influx in this sub of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/\">bot accounts</a> that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it&#39;s still worth holding GME.</p>\n\n<p>If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I&#39;ll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other &quot;next targets of Reddit&quot;, Qanon comparisons, etc);</p>\n\n<p>if Citadel (a market maker) didn&#39;t give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);</p>\n\n<p>if Citron research hadn&#39;t tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (<strong>the next day</strong>) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)...and proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.</p>\n\n<p>if people didn&#39;t see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;</p>\n\n<p>if the price movements weren&#39;t extremely suspect and rapid;</p>\n\n<p>if there wasn&#39;t constant reporting about &quot;shorts have definitely already covered&quot; for weeks;</p>\n\n<p>if we hadn&#39;t seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I&#39;ve seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);</p>\n\n<p>Edit: if the GME and AMC graphs hadn&#39;t been paralleling each other for a week;</p>\n\n<p><strong>if brokers almost across the board hadn&#39;t SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options</strong>;</p>\n\n<p>if institutional ownership wasn&#39;t over 100%, and shorters hadn&#39;t been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it&#39;s lower now, but it&#39;s still <strong>insanely</strong> high imo);</p>\n\n<p><strong>and finally IF there wasn&#39;t a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Then people (including myself) wouldn&#39;t be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t ever buy stock/options with money you can&#39;t afford to lose.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
