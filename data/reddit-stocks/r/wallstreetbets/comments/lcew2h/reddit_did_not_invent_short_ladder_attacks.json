I&#39;m not a financial professional, so I cannot say with certainty that such attacks are possible in practice, but what I <em>can</em> say is that they were in fact described by others well before the GME thing. I&#39;d like to believe that the individuals claiming it&#39;s a WSB meme are just ignorant, but it may be just another attempt to manipulate WSB. So let&#39;s set the record straight.</p>\n\n<p>This blog post from 2008 describes a &quot;short down ladder&quot; attack used by shorting hedge funds:<a href=\"https://shareholdersunite.com/the-ioc-files-useful-background-material/short-sellers-and-naked-shorting/\">https://shareholdersunite.com/the-ioc-files-useful-background-material/short-sellers-and-naked-shorting/</a></p>\n\n<p>This Seeking Alpha post from 2014 describing flooding the order books with counterfeit shares:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Finstablog%2F11442671-gerald-klein%2F3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack\">https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Finstablog%2F11442671-gerald-klein%2F3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack</a></p>\n\n<p>This public comment on the SEC site from 2008 about how counterfeit shares were used to manipulate the price of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"/u/Professional_Fig7437\">u/Professional_Fig7437</a> for mentioning that this practice was previously called &quot;painting the tape.&quot;  This SEC article describes an incident where the price was driven up, not down.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>placing successive buy orders in small amounts at increasing prices  (painting the tape) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/2008/dig082808.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/2008/dig082808.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"/u/ForlornWanderer0\">u/ForlornWanderer0</a> for another SEC doc, this time they are called “matched orders”.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>May be done at successively higher and higher prices to move market price of security upwards</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/Market%20Manipulations%20and%20Case%20Studies.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/files/Market%20Manipulations%20and%20Case%20Studies.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>I vaguely remember another SEC document being posted here last week on the topic, but can&#39;t find it anymore. If anyone has a link to that or other documents, please PM or post in comments.</p>\n\n<p>All of these documents roughly describe the same process of selling counterfeit shares back and forth to lower stock prices. Now, again, I cannot say for certain that such attacks are really possible. But I can say that they were <em>not</em> invented by reddit.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I do not think the 100/200 share orders we&#39;ve seen are proof of this. Nor do I think we&#39;ve seen these attacks every day. However, I&#39;m fairly certain we saw this attack specifically on the day RH blocked buying. The massive decrease in buy pressure would have allowed hedgies to freely trade back and forth without risking their shares being bought. RH blocking buys and ladder attacks combined probably caused the crash we saw that day.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, back to GME short positions. For those wondering if Melvin has indeed covered their short position already, this article summarizes the possibility that they have bought synthetic longs from a MM (Citadel) instead: <a href=\"https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/\">https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/</a></p>\n\n<p>DISCLAIMER: I am not a professional and this is not financial advice. Do your own research. I&#39;m open to counterpoints, please post any information you have in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Added painting tape link, section about when this attack probably occurred.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: Added “matched orders”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
