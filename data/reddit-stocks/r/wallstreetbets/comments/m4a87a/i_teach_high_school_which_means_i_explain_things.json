So here you go.</p>\n\n<p>Note: before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things, remember that this is a basic primer for idiots; some of it has been simplified.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT IS A CALL OPTION: BASICS</p>\n\n<p>A call option (hereafter referred to simply as a &quot;call&quot;) is a contract that gives you the ability, though not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date, called the expiration date. Example: You buy a $400 call for GME that expires on March 19th. What that means is that at any time between now and end-of-day on 3/19, you can buy 100 shares of GME for $400. If the price spikes to $700 dollars, you can still buy them for $400. That&#39;s a pretty good deal.</p>\n\n<p>So I need the price of GME to get to $400 to break even, and anything above that is profit, right? Not quite. You have to pay a premium for the option, which is the amount of money you&#39;re giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract. The premium is listed as the price per share, so if the option has a $2 premium, that means that you have to pay $2 per share of GME in the contract, which means that you pay $200 the buy the call ($2/share x 100 shares). You give the seller $200, and they give you the call option. Since you paid $200 for the option, this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share. Why? Because if the price only got to $400, you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract, which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste. However, if the price goes to $403/share, then you make a profit, because you effectively paid $402/share for a stock worth $403/share.</p>\n\n<p>But what if the price doesn&#39;t go up, or even goes down? Do I have to still buy those shares for $400? No. You never have to buy the shares if you don&#39;t want to. Remember, a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400, but not the obligation.</p>\n\n<p>But what if the price of GME goes way up but I don&#39;t have $40,000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share? Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40,000 sitting around, or (slightly advanced info here that you don&#39;t need to know) to someone who is trying to offset a position. Regardless of who buys it, they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM, or in the money. What does that mean? Let&#39;s look at some option vocabulary.</p>\n\n<p>CALL OPTION VOCABULARY</p>\n\n<p>Strike Price: This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract. In our $400 call option above, the strike price is $400. At any time before the expiration date, you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400/share for the stock.</p>\n\n<p>Exercise: Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock. In the example above, you would spend $40,000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stock&#39;s price at the time. Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock? No. If you can&#39;t afford to exercise, then you can sell your option to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>Expiration Date: This is when your call expires. if you have a 3/19 expiration date, that means that your call option is no longer good after 3/19</p>\n\n<p>Premium: The premium is the price you pay to the call-seller for the contract, and it is listed as the price per share. Knowing that, how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of .25? If you do the math, it will cost you $25, which is .25/share x 100 shares.</p>\n\n<p>ITM and OTM: &quot;In the Money,&quot; and &quot;Out of the Money.&quot; ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price. If you have a $400 call, and the price of GME goes to $405, then your call is ITM because you can buy a $405 stock for $400. If you then immediately sold the stock for $405, you&#39;d make money. OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price. If you have a $400 call and the price of GME is $350, then your call is OTM. It is important to realize that being ITM doesn&#39;t mean being profitable. In the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium, if GME goes to $401, you are ITM because 401&gt;400, but you haven&#39;t broken even yet because your break-even price is $402.</p>\n\n<p>FDs: FD is not an investment term, and you don&#39;t need to know what it means in order to understand calls. It is a WSB term, and it stands for maggot&#39;s delight (but with an F, because autmod won&#39;t let me define FDs). FDs are OTM calls with short expirations, and as such are a huge gamble. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3r3v2/found_out_how_to_buy_call_options_yesterday/\">The guy who spent 90k on 1dte (1 &quot;day to expiration&quot;) OTM GME calls?</a> Those were all FDs, and they all expired worthless. Why are they called FDs? Because when you buy FDs, you usually end up taking it in the ass.</p>\n\n<p>WHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS, THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND. HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT</p>\n\n<p>You have probably seen something like this: GME $400c 3/19. Let&#39;s break it down.</p>\n\n<p>GME $400c 3/19 - The GME stands for Gamestop, which you probably figured out. The $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400. If it said $400p, it would be a put option, but we&#39;ll talk about those later. The 3/19 stands for the expiration date.</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s make it more complicated. If I said, &quot;I bought 10 $5 GME $800c 3/19,&quot; what do I mean?</p>\n\n<p>It means that I bought ten contracts of GME $800 calls with a 3/19 expiration, and I paid $5 per share. If I paid $5 per share, how much did I spend on my contracts? I spent $5,000 ($5/share x 100 shares x 10 contracts).</p>\n\n<p>Now you try it. A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share. How would you explain to me that you bought two of them?</p>\n\n<p>You would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19. Now you can look like you know what you&#39;re talking about even though you still probably don&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>WHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS?</p>\n\n<p>This is confusing. Why do people even do this? People buy call options because you can make a lot of money. If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price, then for every $1 the share price goes above your break-even price, you make $100. If you have a $400c with a break even of $402, and the price gets to $412, then you make $1,000 profit. That&#39;s $10 of profit ($412-$402) times 100 shares. You can buy the shares and hold them, or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit. Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money. It is usually better to sell the contract, but that&#39;s not an important distinction because most of you can&#39;t afford to exercise anyway, and will be selling contracts.</p>\n\n<p>WHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS?</p>\n\n<p>When you buy a stock, at least you own the stock. If you buy an option and it expires worthless, then you have nothing. If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held, then he&#39;d still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME, +/- 5% depending on when he bought on Thursday. Instead, he has nothing.</p>\n\n<p>WHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING</p>\n\n<p>So you bought a call option, and every time you look at it it&#39;s worth a different amount of money. That&#39;s because there are actually two types of value in an option: options have Intrinsic Value, and Extrinsic Value.</p>\n\n<p>Intrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option, If you own a $400c, and the price is $412, then the intrinsic value of the option is $12/share, or $1200, because that&#39;s the value you would get if you exercised it right now. as stock price goes up, intrinsic value goes up. Pretty easy.</p>\n\n<p>Extrinsic Value has a more complicated definition, so we&#39;re going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has, and that potential is based on time and volatility. For example, if there is a long time before expiration, then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM, because more time = more chances for the price to rise. Therefore, options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration. Conversely, less time to expiration = less value, which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases. This is called theta decay, but you don&#39;t need to worry about that.</p>\n\n<p>Volatility is the second part of extrinsic value, and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily, because if a stock price swings wildly up and down, there&#39;s a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM. This is reflected in a measurement called IV, or Implied Volatility. Like Theta Decay, IV is a more advanced concept that you don&#39;t need to understand now as long as you get the basics.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the factors of time (theta) and volatility (IV) constantly changing, the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time. This is why the value of your option will constantly change. Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways (low volatility)? Your option value will decrease as IV drops. Is the stock starting to jump around? Your option value will increase as IV increases.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing. Why do you think that is? If the stock value is increasing slowly, but you&#39;re way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow, the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise, and your option value can decrease.</p>\n\n<p>I BOUGHT A CALL AND I&#39;M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS</p>\n\n<p>You can sell your contracts at any time. You don&#39;t have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts. This is good, because if the price spikes, you can dump your options for profit and move on. There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guy&#39;s 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290. If he had sold then, he wouldn&#39;t have lost everything by waiting until expiration.</p>\n\n<p>I BOUGHT A CALL AND I&#39;M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS</p>\n\n<p>Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button. They get your money, and you get their shares. This can take some time.</p>\n\n<p>OK. I GET IT. BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TL:DR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DON&#39;T GET IT</p>\n\n<p>A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. To buy the contract, you pay a premium to the contract seller. If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract, you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit.</p>\n\n<p>The End.</p>\n\n<p>SO I&#39;M AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY?</p>\n\n<p>No. You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous. Don&#39;t go crazy. Buy a call. See how it works for real. Don&#39;t YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge. Or do. Live your life how you want; I&#39;m not your dad. Just make sure you post the porn when you win or lose.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
