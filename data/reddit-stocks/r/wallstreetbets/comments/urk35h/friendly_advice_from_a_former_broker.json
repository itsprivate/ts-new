We cannot give financial advice or say anything that could be taken as financial advice, but I can ask question about wtf you are doing until you say you don’t know. \n\nSimply put if you are speaking with a broker and they keep asking questions about your trade, you most likely are placing a shit trade. \n\n\nPs stay away from penny stock and otm short dated contracts for the love of god",
