We don’t care about what your giant plans are that “can’t go wrong”. The fact is we have to cover our asses. If you call in with a stupid trade that looks like it will lose money, we can’t simply say don’t do that trade. We are expected to ask question and slowly give you the idea that maybe that trade is shit. We cannot give financial advice or say anything that could be taken as financial advice, but I can ask question about wtf you are doing until you say you don’t know. \n\nSimply put if you are speaking with a broker and they keep asking questions about your trade, you most likely are placing a shit trade. \n\n\nPs stay away from penny stock and otm short dated contracts for the love of god",
