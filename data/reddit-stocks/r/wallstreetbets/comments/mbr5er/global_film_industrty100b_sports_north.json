This is a VALUE stock and you bought it at a huge discount.  </p>\n\n<p>*Earnings per share estimate was $1.35, the actual was $1.34 - they met expectations.</p>\n\n<p>*Q4 online sales were up 175% for the quarter, and 191% for the year.  They have already started the pivot to e-commerce.</p>\n\n<p>*They paid $57 million in debt and still had $635m in cash.</p>\n\n<p>*They cut operating expenses by 18% in Q4, and 21% for the fiscal year.</p>\n\n<p>But the real value of this stock comes from its future, not its past performance.  If they were killing it, you wouldn&#39;t get it at a discount.  You make money by being ahead of Wall Street, and right now Wall Street focuses on old measurements and mature companies.  You only hit it big if you can see what most people can&#39;t, or won&#39;t see.  Go watch DFV videos on YouTube from last July.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Cohen is a freaking genius.  Anyone that can take on Amazon and win is a really good bet in my opinion.  He invested </p>\n\n<p>Hired Keli Durkin on 3/1/2021 to oversee Customer Service and Engagement Initiatives.  Guess where she came from?  Chewy<br/>\nHired Josh Krueger on 3/1/2021 to oversee GME&#39;s e-commerce fulfillment.  Guess where he came from?  Amazon<br/>\nJenna Owens named as COO today.  Guess where she came from?  Amazon and before that Google and McKinsey.<br/>\nNeda Pacifico was named as Senior Vice President of E-commerce today.  Guess where she came from?  Chewy.<br/>\nHired Matt Francis as first-ever Chief Technology Officer today.  Guess where he came from?  Amazon</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll admit, it sucked to see the price drop after-hours below my cost.   Let&#39;s just say I have a material portion of my net worth in GME.  But ultimately, you either believe in the company or not.  I have 35 years of accounting and executive mgmt - I&#39;ve studied up on this company.  Considering the success and expertise of the people driving the GME rocket, I&#39;m all in and I&#39;m not folding.  </p>\n\n<p>The gaming industry is bigger than movies and all North American sports - COMBINED, and these are committed customers trust me.  It&#39;s like asking an addict if they plan to buy drugs this year.  Duh, they are going to buy more.</p>\n\n<p>When you think about what is on the line for these hedge funds, did you really think they were just going to fold?  Those bastards only win if you quit.  Hold the stock because it&#39;s a really good investment, not because it&#39;s a short-squeeze opportunity, though that&#39;s some nice icing on the top.  Patience, nothing good ever comes easy.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the only way to beat Goliath is if a whole lot of Apes stand together.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice, just my opinion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
