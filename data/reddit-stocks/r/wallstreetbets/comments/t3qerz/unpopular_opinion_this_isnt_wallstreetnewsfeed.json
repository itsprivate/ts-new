It isn’t going to happen and this isn’t actionable advice.\n\n“Economists predict Russian annual inflation to hit 69.420% (not a joke)”\n\nI don’t care. This isn’t actionable advice. There wasn’t a position posted. This is literally the definition of “priced in”. \n\n“Zelensky says Ukraine will meet with Russia for peace talks. 🙌💎bro! Hold!”\n\nLeave this in r/politics. I don’t care. I’m trying to make money. If you think this means anything, write up a DD and put some money on the line.\n\nHere, I’ll do it for you: Putin is calling for peace talks—&gt;zelensky will hold Kyiv—&gt;Putin will retreat—&gt;sanctions will be lifted—&gt; long 3000 shares of Sberbank at $1.25. With this much vol, the equity trades like an option. Sberbank will either get delisted and my max loss is less than $4000, or it will go back up and has a 10x upside. \n\nEven if Russian companies are uninvestable after sanctions are lifted, you are literally picking this up for like 6 months cash flow.\n\nPlease, leave the propaganda and politics to another sub. If your post isn’t actionable advice, take it somewhere else. If you didn’t put your money on the table, you have no skin in the game, and therefore have zero credibility as a trader or in finance.",
