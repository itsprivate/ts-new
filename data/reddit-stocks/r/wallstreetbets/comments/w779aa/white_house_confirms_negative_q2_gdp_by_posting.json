  "selftext": " With Q2 GDP data being announced this Thursday on July 28th, Pelosi's boss and gang have already began defending the presumably negative number we‚Äôll see.\n\nOn the heels of a negative Q1 GDP of -1.6%, some of the most recent Q2 forecasts are pointing to barely positive Q2 GDP, or possibly (most likely) negative for upcoming estimates:\n\n[**Goldman Sachs:**](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/07/goldman-slashes-gdp-forecast-for-the-second-quarter-to-just-barely-above-water.html#:~:text=Goldman%20slashes%20GDP%20forecast%20for%20the%20second%20quarter%20to%20just%20barely%20above%20water,-Published%20Thu%2C%20Jul&amp;text=Goldman%20sliced%20its%20second%2Dquarter,a%20whisker%20of%20a%20recession) \\+0.7%\n\n[**The Conference Board:**](https://www.conference-board.org/research/us-forecast#:~:text=While%20we%20do%20not%20believe,indicators%20in%20May%20and%20June.) \\+0.8%\n\n[**Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta:**](https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/cqer/researchcq/gdpnow/RealGDPTrackingSlides.pdf) \\-1.6%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this is where it gets saucy. As some of you less retarded people might already know, the criteria of a recession is generally acknowledged as the occurrence of 2 consecutive quarters with negative GDP. I‚Äôve included some examples, rather than pull this claim out of my loose ass:\n\n[**Investopedia:**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp) *‚ÄúThe working definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth as measured by a country's gross domestic product (GDP), although the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) does not necessarily need to see this occur to call a recession, and uses more frequently reported monthly data to make its decision, so quarterly declines in GDP do not always align with the decision to declare a recession.‚Äù*\n\n[**Forbes:**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-a-recession/) *‚ÄúIn 1974, economist Julius Shiskin came up with a few rules of thumb to define a recession: The most popular was two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. A healthy economy expands over time, so two quarters in a row of contracting output suggests there are serious underlying problems, according to Shiskin. This definition of a recession became a common standard over the years.‚Äù*\n\n[**United state Government Accountability Office:**](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-734sp.pdf) *‚ÄúA pervasive, substantial decline in overall business activity that is of at least several*\n\n*months‚Äô duration. The National Bureau of Economic Research identifies recessions*\n\n*on the basis of several indicators. As a rule of thumb, recessions are commonly*\n\n*identified by a decline in real GDP for at least two consecutive quarters.‚Äù*\n\n[**Business Insider:**](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-recession) *‚ÄúA recession is a significant economic downturn spread across the economy that lasts more than a few quarters. More specifically, Recessions often get boiled down to a simple definition: when gross domestic product (GDP) declines for two consecutive quarters. This prevailing line of thought, popularized by economist Julius Shiskin in 1974, only captures a small corner of a recession's true scope.‚Äù*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow just last week, a couple posts from whitehouse.gov are already claiming that the textbook definition of a recession (2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP) isn‚Äôt the REAL measure of a recession:\n\n[**How Do Economists Determine Whether the Economy Is in a Recession?**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2022/07/21/how-do-economists-determine-whether-the-economy-is-in-a-recession/#_ftnref1) *‚ÄúWhile some maintain that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession, that is neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle.‚Äù*\n\n[**ICYMI: Treasury Secretary Yellen Says US Economy Not in Recession**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/24/icymi-treasury-secretary-yellen-says-us-economy-not-in-recession/) *‚ÄúAs she explains, the technical and actual definition of a recession takes into account ‚Äúa broad range of data‚Äù and states ‚Äúthis is not an economy that‚Äôs in recession.‚Äù*\n\n*TODD: ‚ÄúIf the technical definition is two quarters of contraction, you‚Äôre saying that‚Äôs not a recession?‚Äù*\n\n*YELLEN: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the technical definition.‚Äù*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJoe and his handlers are clinging to the fact that the National Bureau of Economic Research, a non-profit organization, is technically responsible for ‚Äúofficially‚Äù announcing the beginning and end of a recession. \n\nBut that‚Äôs not going to change the public sentiment around what everyone is already feeling. Come Thursday afternoon, a negative GDP will be announced, media headlines will all claim a Recession is here, and I guess we‚Äôll see what the market decides.\n\n**TLDR**; Negative GDP on Thursday guaranteed. Media will claim Recession is official as of July 28th. Puts on the Economy, idk. \n\n**EDIT**: I'm not *saying* a recession is here, I'm saying the media is going to eat up a negative GDP number. The whole point of this post is the guarantee that Q2 GDP will be negative. I specifically didn't make a claim to what the market will do, so think/do what you wish.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Someone asked for a graph so here's a graph of GDP for 2022\nüìâ",
