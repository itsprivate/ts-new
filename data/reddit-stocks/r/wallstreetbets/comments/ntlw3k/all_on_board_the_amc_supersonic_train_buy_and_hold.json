The selling pressure by RETAIL were so intense that the professionals were not able to stop the fall in time. Thats why we say that the market fall faster than they rise. At $37, they managed to stop the fall as it takes time to stop a fast train. Same applies to your car, if you are driving at 200km/hr , even if you apply the brake, your car will take time to stop. Isnt it</p>\n\n<p>What I found interesting with AMC chart is that we clearly see that the PROFESSIONALS put big money and tried hard to stop the fall but some retails put too much selling pressure. Professionals buying heavily, is a great signal of strength . When all these retards and weak hands are out, the bullish trend will continue and price will move higher. This is a certainty! </p>\n\n<p>I am doubling my position on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>To all bears out there shorting AMC, i have some wise words for you ; its dangerous to stand in front of a train coming at you at 300km/hr! </p>\n\n<p>Lets all get onboard AMC supersonic trains. All retards retails and weak apes who sold during past trading sessions, get back on board and dont sell this time . Buy and hold!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
