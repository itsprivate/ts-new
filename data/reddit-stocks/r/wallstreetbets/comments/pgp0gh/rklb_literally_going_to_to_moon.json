Of course, Space X is ahead of them in this regard, but there is room for competition in this sector. \n\n• Developing on-orbit refuelling, this is something Space X are also developing with Starship, Rocketlab want to do this with their Electron satellites, which are currently operational, so it’s very possible they could do this before Space X.\n\n• Their CEO literally ate his hat in a promo video.
