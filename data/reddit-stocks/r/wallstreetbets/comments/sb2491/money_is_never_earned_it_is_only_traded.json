You are making a trade, time for money, and it's a shit trade, because no matter how rich you ever become you cannot buy more time. Time, when compared to money, has nearly infinite value. Any trade of time for money, is a bad deal. A lot of the time you don't really have a choice, but a shit deal is still a shit deal.

This causes economies to overheat and rapid inflation, because the balance of trading power did not change, it just got pumped up on steroids. Because everyone now has way more trading power then they had before, there is a shortage of laborers and things to buy. Inflation is the natural response of trading power returning to the mean.

There's a lot of reasons people have to take that bad trade, but it's a bad trade, get out of it as soon as you can and don't let people make you feel guilty. I'm sure a lot of people who think that they \"earn a living\" are going to be pissed, but hey, fuck em.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPPS: \"Most of us aren't born into money\" If you learn to listen to wise advice, your children will be",
