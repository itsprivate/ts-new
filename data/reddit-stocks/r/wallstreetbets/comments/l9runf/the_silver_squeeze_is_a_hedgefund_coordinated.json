There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS &amp; the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are. </p>\n\n<p>By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.</p>\n\n<p>The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in. </p>\n\n<p>If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I’d recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME. </p>\n\n<p>For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist. </p>\n\n<p>BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it&#39;s not a good hedge, I&#39;m not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I&#39;m simply pointing out that right now, this &quot;squeeze&quot; that all these people are referring to is definitely not a &quot;squeeze&quot; at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don&#39;t trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG</p>\n\n<p>Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla. Look to your left, now look to your right, these are your brethren and sisterthren who will diamond hands with you until we all pass down these tendies to our children&#39;s children. Onward.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
