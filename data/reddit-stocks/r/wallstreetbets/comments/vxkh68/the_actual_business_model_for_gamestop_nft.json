Instead they would want to partner with them and enable these companies to make more money from the huge volumes of digital assets people already paid for and eager to make a resale! Knowing that I can resell my iTunes movies will allow me to binge purchase movies!\n\nAnd….\n\nImagine if GTA game started allowing you to actually buy and sell weapons and clothes and etc. for real money on an exchange with other players using a low fee NFT exchange that everyone already knows and trusts! The entire game industry is going cash money! The global games market is NOW over $180 BILLION, which is more than movie and music industry combined!\n\nTLDR;\n\nGME will push forward with … \n\n1) NFT as we know it yesterday… speculative digital art?\n\n2) NFT exchange to facilitate tradable progress/achievements within games (think GTA guns &amp; gear) between players.\n\n3) NFT as a resale marketplace for used digital games/movies/music by becoming a large volume processor like Visa.\n\nThis is like investing in Apple when it was about to go bankrupt and Microsoft had to bail them out!!\n\nTo the moon, and build a base!\nBUY, HODL, DRS!\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",
