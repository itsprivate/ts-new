Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Similar market conditions:</strong> Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.</p>\n\n<p>Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly (<a href=\"https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\">https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME</a>). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.</p>\n\n<p>Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It&#39;s also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RH:</strong> As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I&#39;m saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short interest</strong>: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How OTM calls can multiply this</strong>: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Catalysts</strong>: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Point</strong>: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: <a href=\"https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/\">https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/</a></p>\n\n<p>The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.</p>\n\n<p>STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they&#39;re still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven&#39;t learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can&#39;t emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don&#39;t get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I&#39;m jacked right, now. I&#39;M JACKED TO THE TITS.&quot;\nI&#39;ll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon. \nHOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
