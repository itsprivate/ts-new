Omicron has a third of the hospitalization rate, but I cannot emphasize enough how infectious this thing is. Look at [these carts](https://imgur.com/a/cbQY4Pn)\n\nEdit 2: most controversial post on Reddit in the last hour! I want to emphasize that omicron is more mild, but if people are still quarantining with mild symptoms at the same time, there will be a major labor crisis. This argument, along with the CDC‚Äôs decision to reduce quarantine to 5 days, technically supports re opening (with reasonable precautions).",
