At $10,000 per share GME will only be #8 on the list. At $19,500 it will be #5. At $30,323 it will pass Apple as #1 on the list. And at $32,445 it will be approximately the size of VW during it&#39;s Squeeze (approx. 7% higher than the current #1).</p>\n\n<p>This thing has lots of room to grow, don&#39;t fold early and live the rest of your life regretting that you missed out on GME. Telling all of your friends/family how you could&#39;ve been rich but got scared and sold too early.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice. I have a large risk appetite and want to retire early. My current position is 828 GME Shares at cost of $96.87 (started at $300+) and 15 $100 call options.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
