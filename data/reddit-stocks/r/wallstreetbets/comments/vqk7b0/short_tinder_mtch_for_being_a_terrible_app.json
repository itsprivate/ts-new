I even bought the $8 unlimited swipes to try and help boost my chances of talking to women. \n\nI got one match and she never responded after asking how I was. After a week of nothing and constant swiping, I decided to [delete](https://imgur.com/a/oy1HXn0) the app and short the fuck out of the stock or buy puts to protest this app since it cucked me. I can’t believe I threw $8 at this for nothing, so now I’ll throw my life savings against it to short it. \n\nMTCH is not just tinder, it is a group of 14 dating apps such as hinge, okc, plenty of fish, and a bunch of others. You can check their [website](https://mtch.com/ourcompany) out to see more. Maybe 2 of these apps are widely used (tinder and hinge) so that’s not a good start if you have 14 apps and only 2 are popular. \n\nWe’ve seen companies like Netflix get absolutely hammered due to a loss in subscriptions. Match is about to head in the same direction. When a recession comes will people pay $25 a month for tinder gold? Idk about you but I don’t want to pay $25 a month for 0 matches and a bruised ego. \n\nAfter I deleted the app I vented my frustrations out in the daily discussion thread where user u/sloanemonroe told me only 4% of guys get swiped on. Think about how many times your puts have had a 4% chance of hitting and expired worthless. That’s you on tinder. You think you’ll get a lot, but you end up expiring worthless and getting no matches. Don’t blame yourself, blame the app that needs to go be yeeted out of existence. \n\nI just don’t see how they keep a paying user base during a recession and I don’t see how they didn’t spread themselves too thin with 14 apps. The stock also has a 79PE while the actual stock is priced at $71. Everything about this company screams short it to 0. If Snapchat tanked 60% in a day, I don’t see how MTCH won’t. \n\nThis is how capitalism works. When a company fails to serve the needs of the people we short the fuck out of it and put it out of business so a competitor can do it right. That’s what needs to happen here.\n\nEdit: for those saying institutions own most of this stock, they are doing this to start a massive short position like they do to other stocks they short.",
