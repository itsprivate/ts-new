Make that big first trade something to REALLY brag about or turn those shares you’ve piled up into some serious equity! See you Monday bright and early retards 💎🙌🏻</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Things to note for all the comments asking the same questions:\n1.) can I still buy in? \n     Yes, buy as many shares or calls as you want but for for devilssake don’t put your grocery money, rent money, or bail money on this shit. Only what you can afford to loose. At the end of the day, don’t end up becoming like the thing we swore to destroy</p>\n\n<p>2.) shares or calls? \n     Shares are the driving force of this surge. Safer in the long run even if you buy at whatever “top” you think it’s at because if it goes down a couple bucks and you succumb to paper hands then you’re not out the money like you be in calls. \n     Calls are a way to make money or loose money in ludicrous speed as well, but keep in mind non of this would be possible without shares and in the end it’ll still be shares that stand the strongest. Only my OPINION. </p>\n\n<p>3.) who is <a href=\"/u/Deepfuckingvalue\">u/Deepfuckingvalue</a> ? \n     Simple: THE FUCKING MAN, that’s who. So stfu and thank him in your weekend-closed prayers. </p>\n\n<p>4.) what are my positions? \n     I won’t post mine because I’m in a pickle with the whole “don’t tell your family how much you make” conundrum, and thanks to this post I think I just doxxed myself... so let’s just say I’m in the “retarded” position. </p>\n\n<p>5.) what’s the top? \n     The top is when you’ve had enough. When you can’t take the pressure of the “gamble”. When you look at yourself in the mirror and say “not today paper hands” or when it all comes crashing down to 0 after the peak at $420.69 (EDIT or at 1,000,000 fuckers it was a joke duh) All I can say is get out when you’re ready to not have FOMO in either direction it goes thereafter. </p>\n\n<p>6.) Lastly, why are you reading this shit? \n     Because you’re regarded. I am retarded, and I don’t deserve a podium anymore then any of you. Take your gold back and your silver back and spend it on GME shares, please. 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
