The type of mistakes that would likely throw the average person into a full-blown panic attack, or worse...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The first &quot;issue&quot; was during the $GME uprising. I woke up like the rest of you, except with a <strong>$234,357.55 cash call</strong> on my account. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mrndbfvwxax61.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c62fa1ae8a0f65d77c9f75e490d231fd166e4f25\">Cash Call</a></p>\n\n<p>You may be thinking, &quot;you stupid fucking idiot stop playing with margin and that wont happen&quot;, but my account was never even approved for margin lol. I owned <strong>&lt;10 shares</strong> of $GME at the time, and was selling them 1 by 1 as the price travelled through the $300&#39;s (sorry). So when I saw that I somehow had unwillingly entered a <strong>short position of 736 SHARES OF $GME AT $22.86</strong>, which my account literally did not have the ability to do, I freaked the fuck out. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vcil9kxoyax61.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c50088143246cfe6c270f5d6b66380aa8d837d7\">https://preview.redd.it/vcil9kxoyax61.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c50088143246cfe6c270f5d6b66380aa8d837d7</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m still not sure what happened that day, but E*TRADE admitted it was an &quot;error&quot; on their end. Huh, what kind of error results in a massive (and impossible) short position on the biggest stock explosion in decades? There wasn&#39;t even an order # attached to the trades...imagine being someone who checks their portfolio weekly or monthly rather than 60 times a day, and seeing this shit pop up, not knowing if you made some terrible mistake and your life was completely ruined?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/li4mkcn61bx61.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc1c9b50fcd678eb7f9a798cc2fd16bcf218966\">https://preview.redd.it/li4mkcn61bx61.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc1c9b50fcd678eb7f9a798cc2fd16bcf218966</a></p>\n\n<p>Well a few months had passed, but last week I decided I finally wanted to upgrade my account to a margin account to allow me to sell a <em>PMCC</em> on a deep ITM $NIO call I owned. I had the cash available for the trade I wanted to make (a few thousand), so this shouldn&#39;t have been an issue. But like clockwork, the PMCC I sold for <strong>19 FUCKING DOLLARS IN PREMIUM</strong> resulted in another error. A Fed Call, for... </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nvmte0tk0bx61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e561f141eebe3292b7a20f21baa62d7f731b76\">https://preview.redd.it/nvmte0tk0bx61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e561f141eebe3292b7a20f21baa62d7f731b76</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>...$21,554.07!</strong> Again, after contacting E*TRADE and looking up whatever a &quot;Fed Call&quot; was, it was deemed to be yet another &quot;error&quot; on their end. The only trade I had made when margin was enabled was a profitable one, too. <strong>$8.</strong> No wonder this country has a mental health problem, thanks E*TRADE.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dkz2l0741bx61.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b12cfa9084bd7ec6a32332284c9d25e96ce96b93\">Sure, Jan.</a></p>\n\n<p>Okay, the fed call thing was ridiculous, so the day after I was approved for the margin account, I downgraded my account (after all the trades had settled) so I wouldn&#39;t have to deal with this nonsense. I thought that would be the end of it. Until this morning, when I woke up to <em>\\</em>drumroll please*,* <strong>over $4,000 in cash missing from my account!</strong> I was the lucky winner of the E*TRADE lottery, because of all the times I&#39;ve had to contact support for their &quot;issues&quot;, I got to pay 1 months salary to a random E*TRADE employee! </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0bwntrqx2bx61.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63eb6e29eda6d955e9d733854cfe97a7d4157093\">Thank you, have a nice day!</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As I write this, the cash has since been deposited back into my account, but how is this acceptable? If the average person looks at their retirement account once a month and sees a hundred thousand dollar cash call, or a twenty thousand dollar &#39;Fed Call&#39;, they may not act rationally - that&#39;s a lot of fucking money. And they&#39;d have no idea if it was an error or not because you would ASSUME that a multi, multi billion dollar brokerage wouldn&#39;t make mistakes like this...or maybe not.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the point of this post is to remind people to <strong>be careful</strong>. Up until recently, this hasn&#39;t been an industry where regular people had access to these resources, and it seems like they wish it stayed that way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
