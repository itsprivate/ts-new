Secondly if they would‘ve closed and therefore bought shares, the price wouldn’t be where it is atm. It would be way higher. Third, why would they invest so much effort (market and media manipulation) if they already exited?</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Last attempt as in „I believe that this ladder attacking tactic will be the last thing that they can try on us“.
