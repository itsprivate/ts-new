  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Since,  apparently, nowhere in the 2.2 million people reading this sub is a  single god damned lawyer (ok, plenty of jailhouse lawyers - I see you,  Mr. Diggs) and because this is a really slow time of year for my firm  while we wait to see how this whole vaccine thing shakes out, I assigned  one of my staff attorneys to look into the concerns I&#39;ve seen expressed  a lot here lately, specifically as it pertains to &quot;market manipulation&quot;  and potential liability exposure stemming from how this sub has  basically become a very large hedge fund comprised mostly of autists who  appreciate great memes.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the short of it:</p>\n\n<p>-  15 U.S.C. § 78 is the relevant US code that governs market  manipulation.  It&#39;s got a few rules.  Publicly traded companies have to  regularly make disclosures (so not WSB).   And it regulates exchanges,  dealers, brokers, insiders, and employees of publicly traded companies  (only you can decide if you&#39;re one of these.  Personally, this raised an  interesting question for me because I&#39;m in venture capital (that,  thankfully, it looks like I&#39;m OK on), but YMMV.  Maybe you work for a  meme company and have gone full retard.  You&#39;re on your own.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Obviously, &quot;market manipulation&quot; is what everybody here is shaking their titties over.  The rules here are pretty simple.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>-You  can&#39;t &quot;create false demand&quot; or overtly distort prices.  Remember, this  law was written in the 1930&#39;s, so being able to lie about something&#39;s  price was easier back then.  Not really applicable today.  Nobody here  is creating &quot;false&quot; demand.  In the case of short squeezes, it&#39;s  creating &quot;actual&quot; demand.</p>\n\n<p>-Can&#39;t  talk about insider information - yet to see that here, so all good.   Even if I did see it, I wouldn&#39;t trust half of you to properly interpret  what you read unless it was full of rocket ships or eggplants.</p>\n\n<p>-Can&#39;t  spread false information about a company.  While I would argue there&#39;s  actually a lot of that here, it&#39;s not with intent, it&#39;s out of ignorance  99 out of 100 times.  Further, the SEC hasn&#39;t effectively enforced this  rule in decades.  There are hedge fund managers who openly admit to  breaking this law.   Plus, the original intent with this law was  (apparently, according to lawyer) meant more for companies to not pull  an Enron.  It is, in other words, in effect toothless.</p>\n\n<p>-The  interesting one is with regards to group trading.  So there&#39;s a whole  set of rules that comes into play when an organized group of traders own  more than 5% of a company&#39;s stock.  I&#39;ll spare all the boring middle  details here because the conclusion is nobody KNOWS how much of a  certain company&#39;s stock this sub collectively owns.  I would posit a  very strong theory that we own quite a bit more than 5% of Gamestop,  BUT....there&#39;s never been a straw poll to prove it and nobody here has  any real way of knowing if that&#39;s the case.  Even if somebody did, they  would have to effectively communicate it to everybody else in the sub to  alert them of potential conflicts/problems, because &quot;intent&quot; is a  qualifier for this particular rule.  There&#39;s no fucking way this island  of misfit toys is going to be effectively communicated that status.   Even if that information did become widely known, it would be impossible  to prove that rocket emojis, calling people paper handed bitches for  exiting a position, or telling people to let their wives&#39; boyfriends  take care of the women while you&#39;re off earning your tendies qualifies  as illegal coordinated manipulation.  Especially given how many bots and  shills Melvin has deployed here lately trying to discourage or scare  people into selling their positions.</p>\n\n<p>Which  means what everybody largely suspected, anyways:  All the people on TV  are blowing hot air to try and scare people at the behest of their hedge  fund manager bosses and to create a story that fits a pre-defined  narrative.  The SEC doesn&#39;t give two shits about you and isn&#39;t spying on  you (but that plumbing van that&#39;s been outside your house might be a  problem - your wife&#39;s boyfriend might have gotten a boyfriend), and you  can take off the tin foil.  Unless you&#39;re long REYN, in which case  you&#39;re probably helping your Boomer stock oh-so-slightly, Randy.</p>\n\n<p>TL:DR:  Securities Fraud requires fraud, which requires intent, so</p>\n\n<p>🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  = fine</p>\n\n<p>💎🤲 = fine</p>\n\n<p>🌈🐻  = not just fine but necessary</p>\n\n<p>🦍🤲💪  = just good strong community bonding</p>\n\n<p><strong>Having  a Gamestop badge and saying the stock is going to $420.69 = You might  want to start practicing the doctrine of Shut The Fuck Up Fridays</strong></p>\n\n<p>Source:   Skinny man with halitosis who claims he went to Cornell.  I never  bothered to do an educational background check on him, so he might have  graduated from the same correspondence school that Saul Goodman went to.</p>\n\n<p>All my love,</p>\n\n<p>Chad Dickens</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
