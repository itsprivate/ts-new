  "selftext": "GameStop Corp. is launching a division to develop a marketplace for nonfungible tokens and establish coin partnerships, according to people familiar with its plans, pushing the company into much-hyped areas as it tries to turn around its core videogame business.\n\nThe retailer has hired more than 20 people to run the unit, which is building an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of virtual videogame goods such as avatar outfits and weapons, according to the people. The company is asking select game developers and publishers to list NFTs on its marketplace when it launches later this year, the people said.\n\nGameStop also is close to signing partnerships with two coin companies to share technology and co-invest in the development of games that use blockchain and NFT technology, as well as other NFT-related projects, the people said. The retailer expects to enter into similar agreements with a dozen or more coin companies and invest tens of millions of dollars in them this year, the people said.\n\nGrapevine, Texas-based GameStop has been working to reset its business after years of losses. The company was at the center of a stock-trading frenzy last year that dramatically boosted its share price, which rode a surge in interest and optimism from individual investors. Many saw potential in GameStop despite the pandemic‚Äôs negative impact on foot traffic and even though consumers have been increasingly opting to download and stream games over the internet, rather than buy the kind of hard copies that the company specializes in selling.\n\nLast year, GameStop overhauled its executive team and board of directors, naming activist investor Ryan Cohen as chairman. Mr. Cohen, who co-founded online pet-products retailer Chewy Inc. and sold it for $3.35 billion in 2017, has been pushing to make GameStop more tech-centric.\n\nEdit- Have seen comments on this news being a smokescreen as a cover for shorts' FTD cycle covering, which indeed make sense and I don't disagree with them.",
