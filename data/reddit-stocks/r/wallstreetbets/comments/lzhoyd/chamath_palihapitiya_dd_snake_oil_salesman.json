He sent out a tweet buying gme, and then sold it later the same day without sending out a sale tweet. He realized people had an issue with this then decided to donate the profits to charity. The problem with this is not only did he make his followers bag hold, but he also gets a free tax write off from them. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232\">https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232</a></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ρ</strong> ump and dumped Virgin galactic.
