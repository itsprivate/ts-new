You&#39;re content.</p>\n\n<p>You sold your GME shares at small loss at the start of the week as you continued to watch the share price plummet due to market manipulation. You got out, you survived. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s 9:28am, you&#39;re returning from the school run. Your BMW 1 series seats make you feel safe and important. Your house, although small, is affordable and the mortgage repayments don&#39;t put too much pressure on your paper wallet. </p>\n\n<p>Your phone goes off as you enter the house. You sit on the sofa and turn on NBC as you open Whatsapp. You have 17 unread messages. </p>\n\n<p>Your eyes pan up, the news anchor is shouting. You read the title at the bottom of the screen - &#39;The Short Squeeze Is Happening&quot;. Jim Cramer is crying. You quickly open your Whatsapp group chat and only see dollar signs being spammed by your friends. You open Yahoo Finance and see the share price at 600.87, it&#39;s still rising. Your heart skips a beat. You open I-phone calculator and work out that your 17 shares would now be worth just over 10,000 US dollars. You feel sick.</p>\n\n<p>The share price is still rising. You receive a call from your best friend Mickey, he&#39;s crying too. He&#39;s telling you about how you were right and he&#39;ll be able to pay off his student loan soon. Also his wife is pregnant. You congratulate him with a fickle grin and fake laugh. You look back down at your phone, 828.16. 830.00, 838.26. </p>\n\n<p>WallStreetBets has crashed due to the traffic. </p>\n\n<p>You realise everything you stood for is coming true, but you paper handed too soon. </p>\n\n<p>You ignored the threads, the experts. You ignored DeepFuckingValue. </p>\n\n<p>You ignored your god given right to a better life for you and your wifes boyfriend. </p>\n\n<p>You try to buy back in, but you have no money. You begin to laugh, and laugh. Despair and anguish turn into humour. </p>\n\n<p>You pull the Glock from your $16 AliExpress safe and load it. You hold it to your head, you shiver. </p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t pull the trigger. Your paper hands can&#39;t do it, and never will be able to do anything of any meaningful value. You drop the gun and admit defeat. </p>\n\n<p>As the camera pans out of your window and over your neighborhood, we see Wall St burning in flames in the distance. The transfer of wealth begins, fade to black.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: DON&#39;T BE THAT GUY 💎💎💎💎💎💎</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
