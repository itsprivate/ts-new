I don't need all the money you guys are forced to make each year on the promised land. Just a note to keep in mind.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nHere it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade stocks:\n\n- $20k\n- $10k\n- $6k from my girlfriend\n- $4k from credit cards\n- some savings from my regular job\n\nThe reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing (the loans were not taken all at once). At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.\n\nWhen GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.\n\nSince that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.\n\nBottom line: I extinguished all my loans BUT $27k I owe the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even (monthly expenses + loan rate). If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700 monthly expenses.\n\nHowever, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?\n\nThanks!\n\n**EDIT 2:** and for those who wonder what happened with my job... I posted my quitting story [three months ago here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/nbvbiw/aita_for_leaving_my_company_in_deep_trouble_after/)",
