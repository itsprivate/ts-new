Play weekly close over 128.00 if you are degen.**\n\n\\---\n\nIt's not often you see $GME form setups like this, so I figured I would share. You might find my point of view interesting since I am not a holder and I only swing the stock on a short-term basis, which gives me a rather unbiased viewpoint.\n\nSome of you might remember me from the last few rallies. Pretty much before every single large GME move to the upside, it forms setups similar to this. The other memey stocks do the same thing, almost like they are all correlated and binded to a sector of their own making. Anyway, let's get to the point.\n\nThe price action the past few weeks is particularly interesting because instead of just dumping after a huge green candle, we are instead maintaining a higher range and consolidating sideways, gathering energy for bullish continuation. This doesn't happen often with $GME.\n\nStarting with the 3Y 1W chart:\n\n[$GME 3Y 1W](https://preview.redd.it/5be78jq02sa91.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c757ea026c6d1bc20ed8de2cc7e2ac5d1c4b6f03)\n\nThis is a massive falling wedge (the setup I mentioned that we form before pretty much every move to the upside).\n\nThe breakout point is at 128.00 - we closed a literal nut hair above it last week. I don't like close calls, I much prefer sure things in trading, so I did not act on this quite yet. I'd like to see another week over to confirm it.\n\nRegardless, this is the largest setup of this nature GME has ever formed, with three solid reactions to the upper trendline. A confirmed breakout would target 200.00, 250.00, 300.00 as logical price targets. I know you guys want to hear GME to infinity, but I'm just being as unbiased as possible.\n\nMoving onto the 1Y 1D chart, which is another reason I have not entered yet:\n\n[$GME 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/pgumvgky2sa91.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3831d89d5107561f919210a87c9a02c7d41d1cfa)\n\nThis is the interesting price action I was talking about from the past few weeks. After that huge rally Mid-May, rather than dumping, we are flagging out and forming another falling wedge - right on the larger one's breakout point. This is an ideal scenario, and healthy for an eventual break to the upside.\n\nTo be safe, rather than playing the red line, you could play the purple one, waiting for a daily close over 144.25 to enter, and looking for the same targets.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind here is this teal line that has confluence with key resistance @ 162.50. This could yield a strong rejection and ruin a breakout, so keep a close eye on it.\n\n**Keep in mind - this purple falling wedge is a downtrend until it breaks. This is another reason I am waiting for us to break it. We could chop down and reject a while longer before clearing it.**\n\n**Also keep in mind, it's invalidated and no longer in play if we close a day under 112.65 - this is the bear scenario and could yield a violent breakdown to 78.00 and lower.**\n\nLastly, I'm looking to play STOCK with this setup. GME options are jacked to the tits with IV and have really shitty risk/reward.\n\n\\---\n\nThis is by far the most interesting setup I have seen in the stock since the initial squeeze, but keep in mind it is not a sure thing. Technical analysis is an assessment of probabilities, rather than \"this **WILL** happen\". \n\nIt doesn't really matter for a retard, since stop losses and stuff are mythical creatures to you all, but just something to keep in mind before you lose your shit if it doesn't go up 1000% tomorrow.",
