Market makers will need to deliver him the shares if he doesn’t sell the contract (IMO if he were the type to sell the contract he’d have done it before now, I don’t know maybe at $480 or after at $300? But his hands are completely carbonised diamond lattice burgers)</p>\n\n<p>Now. It’s also my understanding, from reading posts by you glorious apetards, that the decreased volume may have reduced Implied Volume in the options market. And the lowering price has decreased the increments of contract prices (I.e 160,170,180 as opposed to 200,250,300) Does this increase the effectiveness of a gamma squeeze on the price, due to lower price increments and other Greek related stuff?</p>\n\n<p>I’m just curious to what others think of this as a potential catalyst for initiating upward momentum on GME share price. </p>\n\n<p>I’m a simple U.K. 🇬🇧  ape and don’t trade options, just buy and hold with crusty diamond fingers. I’m trying to educate myself with the view of trading options in the future. I’m also a degenerate, brain damaged mess, so if non of this makes sense then what do you expect? I’m only here for the legacy.</p>\n\n<p>I’m excited for next week 🦧 together 💪🏼</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
