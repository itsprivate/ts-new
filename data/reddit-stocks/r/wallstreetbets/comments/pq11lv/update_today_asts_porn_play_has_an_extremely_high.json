Only 55K shares available for Shorting Today! (Fintel 26minutes ago)\n\n# $ASTS is really close to the first Milestone of $12.5 which at market close will exercise 593,100 SHARES in an extremely low float. (GAMMA SQUEEEEZE)\n\n# $12.5 Will Boost it to the next milestone of $15 where 727,200 shares will also be exercised at market close if it stays above it. (GAMMA Turbo Boost!)  \n\nA Gamma/Short squeeze is very possible **today** and it's quite simple:\n\n1- Yesterday $ASTS had a volume of 956,348(very low) and the stock went up 4.94%(and 8.8% after market). This indicates how truly small the float is and how easily it could MOON.\n\n2- As I mentioned above, $ASTS is very close to it's Miles stones. At $15, with the strikes of $2.5, $5, $7.5, $10, $12.5, and $15, at close if we remain above $15, The combined exercisable stocks would be **1,541,200 shares!! almost 1.5 times more than yesterdays volume!!! Add to that the dried up ammo of shorts, A run above $15 could continue to $18 and beyond.**\n\n3- ASTS is a one of a kind Gamma squeeze play, because unlike $IRNT and $OPAD, it's not even 50% of it's all time high of **$25.37**. The potential upside is very big.\n\n4- Another unique feature is that It's an undervalued play which has attracted the investment and partnership of industry leaders such as AT&T, American Tower, Vodafone, and Rakuten. **Barclays and Deutsche Bank recently gave it a PT of $29 and $35**, but noted **the upside of bananas was much higher once the technology is validated in scale.**\n\nWhat I mentioned were my observations for the possibility of a short/gamma squeeze **today.** I am not advocating a pump and dump. I am sharing that **this compelling company which has been shorted AF and the shorts have run out of ammunition.** They cannot artificially keep the stock price down any more via shorting as they only have a handful of shares left to do so.\n\n**Be warned, If ASTS squeezes, it will become very risky during the squeeze, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose or don't partake at all because it's a retarded move.**",
