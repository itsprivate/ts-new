  "selftext": "Due to recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that I am resigning as a moderator on r/wallstreetbets.\n\nI would like to write this as my final post and clarify my side of the story. But first, a little about me:\n\nAt the age of 16 I joined the French Foreign Legion (FFL). Throughout my time in the FFL, I served in many theaters and battles. One in particular, the Battle of North Sentinel Island, I was captured by Yakuza operatives and became a prisoner of war. I managed to escape and was awarded the Buerre de Cacahuètes au Poisson distinction for heroism ([pictured](https://preview.redd.it/eyindthb0bc71.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bcdcc7fedbb3941f632e66274d67144e3c69b4b)), the highest honor one can receive in the FFL. I never wanted to be a hero. Alas, we cannot choose our own fate. After my discharge from the FFL, I was recruited by the Canadian government as a contractor to head their electronic surveillance unit mainly focused on their efforts to topple the Canadian Eco-terrorist Organization known as the Castor en Colere Liberation Front.  I served honorably alongside u/opinion_is_unpopular. We shared many nights in the tundra huddled by the campfire in our beaver skin tunics sharing war stories over bowls of poutine, as is tradition.  Despite all of the wonderful things I have personally done single-handedly to improve the world, I pride myself on being a humble man. Currently, I am an entrepreneur and run 4 businesses. DM me for my ETSY link. What does any of this have to do with moderating you ask? Well, nothing.\n\nThe actions of the past week are inexcusable. I must apologize to the community for allowing myself to be honey-potted by u/memetron9000. What started off as friendly banter on our side project r/RunicCocksElite, quickly evolved into much more. It got pretty serious, as we would discuss the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model deep into the night. One thing led to another and he was soon sending feet pics.  Little did I know the FUD he would unleash on this community after I allowed him to become a moderator.\n\nThe screenshots that were shared are true. They were taken from a private conversation I had with u/fannypackphantom discussing my past membership in a cannibal coven practicing Juju magic in Sierra Leone. I first met fanny over Twitter and we bonded over a tweet I made regarding the socioeconomic implications of a woman shopping at Duluth Traders for her wardrobe needs.   She was very accepting of my cannibalistic past and I felt comfortable sharing intimate details. Casual conversations amongst what I thought was a friend has now come back to haunt me now that I am a celebrity.\n\nFurthermore, it was I who modded u/pokimane. This is significant because the MSM media would like you to believe that Covid-19 caused the March 2020 recession when in fact it was her appointment as a moderator of r/wallstreetbets that served as the catalyst. Please do not harass her, she is not a Shill.  We have conducted extensive research into her background, mannerisms, and idiosyncrasies and can confirm this. u/zjz has also deployed his shill sniffing bot with negative results. Unfortunately, this has triggered a crippling addiction to her Twitch stream and has rendered him more financially desperate than even most of you poors.\n\nI have done everything in my power to serve this community. Heroic actions such as deleting the unrelenting barrage of trash memes posted by u/throwaway1forall, banning 99% of people who play flair or ban, and encouraging u/yolocallking to include more Brazilian bundas in his memes are just a small sample of the personal sacrifices I have made.\n\nI know so many of you hate me and honestly, fine. I am use to that. I am a Juju practitioner, Heterosexual, wonderful, famous, and amazing. I have always been this way and I am not ashamed of who I am. Had I still been the old Sdevil with the autists at my side, I’d have endured it and risked my life for the community, like I have so many times before. However, I see no reason to risk it and I will resign effective July 21, 2045. In the interim, I will be at r/RunicCocksElite awaiting the arrival of u/sloptart69 in order to apprentice in the ancient ritual of sugar water immersion.\n\nu/MarkCuban\n\nu/PresidentObama\n\nu/JoannaGaines\n\nu/ElonMusk\n\nu/PopeFrancis\n\nu/RachaelDolezal\n\nu/1r0nyman\n\nP.S. If you have gotten this far and believe any of this,  you are in fact a moron. Stay Stonky!",
