  "selftext": "***First and foremost, I am not financial advice and this is not a financial advisor. I don't know shit about fvck - I literally lick windows for a living. I pity the fool who takes anything I say to heart.***\n\n**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices. DRS is the absolute kill switch to this game of psychological warfare because it takes away their most valuable asset in this war - $GME shares.**\n\nThis post is going to be a combination of different ideas with an attempt at tying them all together to understand what is going on with $GME, and the markets in general. It involves abstract topics, but I believe this is what we are seeing with $GME, and the market in general - at least until a force majeure occurs and we blast off to uranus and beyond.\n\nLet's assume 100% of $GME stock trading is routed through dark pools. We know this isn't necessarily the case, because obviously some buys hit the lit market, but the point in assuming 100% of the trading is routed through dark pools is that regardless of how much is forced to hit the lit market, a greater amount gets routed through dark pools to counteract the damage. I'll come back to this later.\n\nRichard Wychoff was an early 20th century pioneer in technical analysis. His position allowed him to witness firsthand the fleecing of retail investors, which brought him to his theories of accumulation/distribution. He described the phenomenon as follows:\n\n***\"…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.\"***\n\nAside from crime (naked shorting, spoofing, etc), how does one LEGALLY take money from retail in the stock market? By getting retail to buy high and sell low, so you can do the exact opposite - what Wychoff outlined in his accumulation/distribution schematics.\n\n**Accumulation** = pick up assets on the cheap. Following accumulation, as pictured below, is a price mark-up phase. The price is allowed to run to where shares accumulated are profitable.\n\n**Distribution** = dump assets to unsuspecting bag holders. Following distribution is a price markdown phase, where the people controlling the market behind the scenes take profits and hope to scare retail into selling their shares at a loss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Credit to u\\/gme2uranus](https://preview.redd.it/qv0aptjq25r81.png?width=1147&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c4739ec6bee3bb79f5ed5f0640c2e0df10d82bf)\n\nBased off the image above, we should be in an accumulation phase - which means fairly shortly we should see a mark up phase where the price of $GME is allowed to run. How does this benefit the \"composite man\" behind the scenes? Well, if it WERE to benefit the composite man, we would expect to see him add more shares during accumulation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BlackRock\\/Vanguard 13D\\/G filings](https://preview.redd.it/9f6b50ys25r81.jpg?width=1378&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16fb8d3cf3a569cd4b8c0f7f263bf9e9e0e81dd0)\n\n[Timing of BR\\/VG filings](https://preview.redd.it/kwtikd5v25r81.jpg?width=1577&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ea95e964f0ea203c15ae53f3fb018a1fca6376)\n\nWell slap my butt and call me Sally. So we know for certain BlackRock/Vanguard added to their positions in what is assumed to be a time period we should see them add, so they can buy low and theoretically sell high. But how does this pertain to $GME, and why did we assume that 100% of the buying in $GME gets routed to dark pools?\n\n[Psychology of a market cycle and how it is used to fleece retail](https://preview.redd.it/n394h72x25r81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4af6e8c77aa80a704004d8fb62d34a5f05f90f56)\n\nManipulated movement designed to prey on retails emotions.\n\nThis picture describes the Wychoff accumulation/distribution schematics in EMOTIONS rather than fundamentals - because regardless of what happens behind the scenes, most retail is impulsive and buys off emotions. Do you feel the electricity from UUSB right now? Can you feel the positive emotion in the air surrounding $GME? **THAT'S THE POINT. FOMO BABY! IT'S MARK-UP TIME!**\n\nThe far left of this picture describes the mark-up period which I believe we are about to hit (I can't give a time frame, just soonish), and the far right of the picture is where I believe we are now - the disbelief rally. Keep in mind Vanguard and BlackRock already increased their position. Ask yourself why? Are they the composite man? Highly likely they are, as well as other big player institutions that have enough money to manipulate the markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dang](https://preview.redd.it/z8xlijn545r81.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e6a5eb65d3b84716e255034aebce274c390e992)\n\n[Mark-Up Table](https://preview.redd.it/ceneoy3335r81.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da0f5d6ec1eb1c259ae36f520f5ae16df7cf2c9d)\n\nI captioned this the mark up table, because a lot of the DD prior using this table has tried tying it to T+2, FTDs, etc.  It's very possible that is the case, but we also have to assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated. If we assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated, this table describes the MARK UP PERIOD outlined in Wychoff's methods. I don't care WHY or HOW the price is being marked up - just that it is, and it is at roughly the same intervals (every 4 months). Remember - the price is fake until it's not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I'm glad you asked](https://preview.redd.it/ahmvhhr635r81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=940ffd7f00a583fa5519e2c5c20b60a5956297af)\n\nIt's highly likely that we operate in a completely parasitic system designed to prey on retails emotions by getting them to buy stocks high and sell stocks low. The people with the money (I'm looking at you, Prime Brokers and Hedge funds), are able to manipulate price movement by routing the majority of orders through their dark pools, keeping complete control over pricing of assets so they can enact these mark-up/mark down periods. After all, this is a LEGAL way big players can steal money from retail in the stock market. By buying low and selling high.\n\nHow do we win, if an unknown entity with more money, power than we can ever dream of controls every movement of the stock market? **We BUY, HODL, DRS.** We buy the dip. We buy the rip. We fvcking hold, no matter how gut wrenching the movements are. We do not give into the psychology of the market cycle. We force the composite man to resort to shorting and illegal activities to continue the market cycle, all while the noose continues to tighten around his neck through decreased liquidity and increased cost of doing business. **Most importantly, we** **DRS**. The composite man has a ridiculous amount of money and power at its disposal, but most importantly - **he (through Cede and Co.), has our shares.** One real share to the composite man allows him to create theoretically an infinite amount of synthetic shares to force retail through the market cycles again and again and again - so long as he has liquidity, which he can create in a million different ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Credit to u\\/bowly741 and u\\/Tokyo\\_Metro](https://preview.redd.it/l4mtgxt835r81.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb64f5d3074ed01ad82c285e8dda6ef3fc6e6839)\n\n**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices.

I don&amp;#39;t know shit about fvck - I literally lick windows for a living. I pity the fool who takes anything I say to heart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices. DRS is the absolute kill switch to this game of psychological warfare because it takes away their most valuable asset in this war - $GME shares.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post is going to be a combination of different ideas with an attempt at tying them all together to understand what is going on with $GME, and the markets in general. It involves abstract topics, but I believe this is what we are seeing with $GME, and the market in general - at least until a force majeure occurs and we blast off to uranus and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume 100% of $GME stock trading is routed through dark pools. We know this isn&amp;#39;t necessarily the case, because obviously some buys hit the lit market, but the point in assuming 100% of the trading is routed through dark pools is that regardless of how much is forced to hit the lit market, a greater amount gets routed through dark pools to counteract the damage. I&amp;#39;ll come back to this later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Richard Wychoff was an early 20th century pioneer in technical analysis. His position allowed him to witness firsthand the fleecing of retail investors, which brought him to his theories of accumulation/distribution. He described the phenomenon as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from crime (naked shorting, spoofing, etc), how does one LEGALLY take money from retail in the stock market? By getting retail to buy high and sell low, so you can do the exact opposite - what Wychoff outlined in his accumulation/distribution schematics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accumulation&lt;/strong&gt; = pick up assets on the cheap. Following accumulation, as pictured below, is a price mark-up phase. The price is allowed to run to where shares accumulated are profitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distribution&lt;/strong&gt; = dump assets to unsuspecting bag holders. Following distribution is a price markdown phase, where the people controlling the market behind the scenes take profits and hope to scare retail into selling their shares at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qv0aptjq25r81.png?width=1147&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0c4739ec6bee3bb79f5ed5f0640c2e0df10d82bf\"&gt;Credit to u/gme2uranus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based off the image above, we should be in an accumulation phase - which means fairly shortly we should see a mark up phase where the price of $GME is allowed to run. How does this benefit the &amp;quot;composite man&amp;quot; behind the scenes? Well, if it WERE to benefit the composite man, we would expect to see him add more shares during accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9f6b50ys25r81.jpg?width=1378&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=16fb8d3cf3a569cd4b8c0f7f263bf9e9e0e81dd0\"&gt;BlackRock/Vanguard 13D/G filings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kwtikd5v25r81.jpg?width=1577&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55ea95e964f0ea203c15ae53f3fb018a1fca6376\"&gt;Timing of BR/VG filings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well slap my butt and call me Sally. So we know for certain BlackRock/Vanguard added to their positions in what is assumed to be a time period we should see them add, so they can buy low and theoretically sell high. But how does this pertain to $GME, and why did we assume that 100% of the buying in $GME gets routed to dark pools?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n394h72x25r81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4af6e8c77aa80a704004d8fb62d34a5f05f90f56\"&gt;Psychology of a market cycle and how it is used to fleece retail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manipulated movement designed to prey on retails emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This picture describes the Wychoff accumulation/distribution schematics in EMOTIONS rather than fundamentals - because regardless of what happens behind the scenes, most retail is impulsive and buys off emotions. Do you feel the electricity from UUSB right now? Can you feel the positive emotion in the air surrounding $GME? &lt;strong&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S THE POINT. FOMO BABY! IT&amp;#39;S MARK-UP TIME!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The far left of this picture describes the mark-up period which I believe we are about to hit (I can&amp;#39;t give a time frame, just soonish), and the far right of the picture is where I believe we are now - the disbelief rally. Keep in mind Vanguard and BlackRock already increased their position. Ask yourself why? Are they the composite man? Highly likely they are, as well as other big player institutions that have enough money to manipulate the markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z8xlijn545r81.jpg?width=500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8e6a5eb65d3b84716e255034aebce274c390e992\"&gt;Dang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ceneoy3335r81.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=da0f5d6ec1eb1c259ae36f520f5ae16df7cf2c9d\"&gt;Mark-Up Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I captioned this the mark up table, because a lot of the DD prior using this table has tried tying it to T+2, FTDs, etc.  It&amp;#39;s very possible that is the case, but we also have to assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated. If we assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated, this table describes the MARK UP PERIOD outlined in Wychoff&amp;#39;s methods. I don&amp;#39;t care WHY or HOW the price is being marked up - just that it is, and it is at roughly the same intervals (every 4 months). Remember - the price is fake until it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ahmvhhr635r81.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=940ffd7f00a583fa5519e2c5c20b60a5956297af\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad you asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s highly likely that we operate in a completely parasitic system designed to prey on retails emotions by getting them to buy stocks high and sell stocks low. The people with the money (I&amp;#39;m looking at you, Prime Brokers and Hedge funds), are able to manipulate price movement by routing the majority of orders through their dark pools, keeping complete control over pricing of assets so they can enact these mark-up/mark down periods. After all, this is a LEGAL way big players can steal money from retail in the stock market. By buying low and selling high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do we win, if an unknown entity with more money, power than we can ever dream of controls every movement of the stock market? &lt;strong&gt;We BUY, HODL, DRS.&lt;/strong&gt; We buy the dip. We buy the rip. We fvcking hold, no matter how gut wrenching the movements are. We do not give into the psychology of the market cycle. We force the composite man to resort to shorting and illegal activities to continue the market cycle, all while the noose continues to tighten around his neck through decreased liquidity and increased cost of doing business. &lt;strong&gt;Most importantly, we&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;DRS&lt;/strong&gt;. The composite man has a ridiculous amount of money and power at its disposal, but most importantly - &lt;strong&gt;he (through Cede and Co.), has our shares.&lt;/strong&gt; One real share to the composite man allows him to create theoretically an infinite amount of synthetic shares to force retail through the market cycles again and again and again - so long as he has liquidity, which he can create in a million different ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l4mtgxt835r81.jpg?width=750&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cb64f5d3074ed01ad82c285e8dda6ef3fc6e6839\"&gt;Credit to u/bowly741 and u/Tokyo_Metro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices.
