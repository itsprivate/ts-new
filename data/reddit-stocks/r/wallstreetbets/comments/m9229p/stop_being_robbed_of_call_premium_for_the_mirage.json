The cheapest and most permanent way to increase the share price is to buy shares. Gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with. Also that hefty call premium you&#39;re paying goes to those betting against GME. Stop giving them your power (money) to use against you.</p>\n\n<p>It pisses me off to see normies and OG retards lose all their savings despite the best intentions.
