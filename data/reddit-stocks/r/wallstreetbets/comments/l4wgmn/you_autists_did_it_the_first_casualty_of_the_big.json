That would have caused Citadel and Point72 to have a portion of their portion go to $0 which would have hurt their returns. They decided to pump more money into it to prevent bankruptcy. </p>\n\n<p>Sounds like these hedge funds are vultures coming in to feast on the carcass.</p>\n\n<p>Who is going to bailout Citadel and Point72 when they get squeezed too?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion into hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which has been hard hit by a series of short bets to start the year.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The influx of cash is expected to help stabilize Melvin, which has lost 30% for the year through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Melvin started the year with $12.5 billion and had been one of the best performing hedge funds on Wall Street in recent years. The losses stem from Melvin’s array of short-bets against companies and have stunned clients and other traders.</p>\n\n<p>Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion invested in Melvin as of 2019, $750 million. The investments are for non-controlling revenue shares in the hedge fund. Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin was a top portfolio manager at Point72’s predecessor firm, SAC Capital Management before he left to start Melvin.</p>\n\n<p>It couldn’t be determined how much of a revenue share Citadel and Point72 would get.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
