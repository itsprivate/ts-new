It reads &quot; A &quot;short squeeze&quot; due to a sudden increase in demand for our class A common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A common stock. Investors may purchase shares of our Class A common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A common stock may involve long and short exposure. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A common Stock available for our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A common Stock for deliver to lenders of our Class\nA common Stock. Those repurchases, may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A common stock until additional shares of our Class A common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a &quot;short squeeze.&quot; A large proportion of our class a Common Stock ha been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A common stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
