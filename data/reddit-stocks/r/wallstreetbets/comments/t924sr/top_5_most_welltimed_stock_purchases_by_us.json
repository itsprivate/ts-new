Here are the results:\n\n1. Purchase of Lockheed Martin ($LMT) by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on February 22nd (+24.4% in two weeks)\n2. Purchase of Chevron ($CVX) by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on February 22nd (+18.3% in two weeks)\n3. Purchase of $PAA by Rep. Virginia Foxx on January 21st (+17.3% in two weeks)\n4. Purchase of Sprague Resources by Rep. Mark Green on January 6th (+16.6% in two weeks)\n5. Purchase of EnLink Midstream ($ENLC) by Rep. Mark Green on February 18th (+13.6% in two weeks)\n\nIf there is significant interest, I will post a list of the worst stock purchases, and the best/worst sales.",
