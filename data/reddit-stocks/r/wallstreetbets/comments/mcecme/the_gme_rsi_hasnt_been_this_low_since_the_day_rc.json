Isn&#39;t that a nice looking number?</p>\n\n<p>With the current fundamental outlook and turnaround story that is unfolding before our eyes, my belief is that there is high potential for additional catalysts coming in the next year, months, weeks, or even days. I&#39;d venture to say it can be a catalyst that triggers even more buying volume than frog ice cream. The timing is what we can&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>What&#39;s my conclusion?</h1>\n\n<p>My calculation is crude and theoretical. The price could go back to $10 for all I know. But Jeffries just raised the PT to $175. There are a ton of potential catalysts coming, and GME RSI is in oversold territory. <strong>I heard from someone with a wrinkle that low RSI = good time to buy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>take care you fucks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
