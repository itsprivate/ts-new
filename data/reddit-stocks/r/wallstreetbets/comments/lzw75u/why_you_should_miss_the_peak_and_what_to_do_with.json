But I also did some research on what to do when you get a huge influx of money like you retarded ape are about to get when you sell each share for 500k.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I would like to state that fuck you Kenny G, and that the SEC can suck my trail mix. But I am not a financial advisor and you should not listen to me. We are not a group, and there is no we. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>First, I would like to address why you should miss the peak and sell on the way down. If you ape sell a share before the peak, you limit your upside of selling that share at a higher price AND you limit how high the peak can go, by adding liquidity to the market you help shorts leave their positions for a bargain and at the same time you screw other apes by limiting how high the peak can go. If you wait out and sell AFTER the peak, you allow the price to go its full way and you alongside other apes can sell their shares for a higher price even if you don’t sell at the peak I believe it is better to hold, miss the 1M per share peak and start selling at 700k instead of selling at 100k missing a possible 600k profit PER SHARE. But that is just me, do whatever the fuck you want. I don’t give a fuck. Again I remind you this shouldn´t be considered a coordinated sell because well, it is illegal. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now, once you stupid uneducated ape gets a hand on millions and for some even billions of dollars, you are going to have to start growing wrinkles in that brain of yours because if you don´t the money will leave your hands just as fast as it came and the world will not become a better place turning the greatest transfer of wealth in human history to a massive lotto winner curse that just bankrupts us.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>You should spend some time at least watching YouTube videos and figure out what to do with those humongous amounts of money. I will leave you some tips I found in my research.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do not tell anyone</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Keep it to yourself, process it, don’t go around telling people you are rich, you will only put yourself at risk or just compromise yourself to fake friends or people asking you for money.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get financial advice (real one)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It is worth going to a credible institution and get help from them, you should get a lawyer, accountant, and a team to help you and assist you with all the problems and difficulties that moving, investing, and spending all that money come with. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Pay your taxes</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Save some money for taxes, advisors help with this but make sure your money is clean and free of any legal or federal compromise so you can use it freely without having to hide or risk going to jail for any funny business. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Pay off your debt</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Liquidate your credit card, your mortgage if it has a high-interest rate, and any other debt you are in, learn how to use debt to your advantage in the future.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hold the money for at least 6 months in your bank account</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>You will have all kinds of crazy ideas of what you will be able to do with the money, let those ideas settle and mature, by not touching the money for some time you will filter out the crazy stupid ideas and keep the valuable ones, be smart and make a plan on how and what to spend the money on.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t quit your job (yet)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We are humans and we need productivity, I don’t mean to keep your 9-5 job forever, but a huge amount of change in a small period of time will make you lose your ground. Start making a plan from today and make the changes bit by bit, let some time pass, make sure you are going in the right direction and you are doing what you want, and what is best for you. I will probably dedicate myself to start a foundation and maybe some businesses but make a plan, start slow and make the changes over time after a good amount of thought. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Invest in yourself, get healthy</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Learn, grow, become wealthy in your head, change your mindset, learn how money works and how to use it, this will allow you to grow your money further, and most importantly, stay wealthy. Learn all of this so you don’t get scammed or stolen from excessive fees in the financial business. Also, work out and stay healthy, I want you to enjoy your money for a long long time.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do not invest in friends businesses or start a business alone right away</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It is a tempting idea but doesn’t go around giving money or investing in any idea your friends have, stay smart, and go little by little, learn about how business works, and don’t spend a huge amount of money investing or starting a business by yourself, read the book “Lean Startup”</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare for change</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I mean, everything, from friends to lifestyle, to wellbeing, to opportunities but also prepare to be the target of greedy or evil people who will want to take money off you.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>5% rule</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Read about it, but basically, you live off what your money produces, you don’t live off your tendies directly instead you live off what your tendies produce.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Play it safe</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>You are already rich, don’t risk it buying weekly tesla calls. Don’t be stupid, stay rich and use your money to grow your wealth, to improve your own life, your family´s life, and the life of those around you. Start a foundation or become a Patreon of one but don’t donate huge amounts of money all at once, diversify, become a monthly contributor that way you can learn about the real needs of each nonprofit and you can help more of them. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Suggest additional things you think are important in the comments and I will update the post.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Godspeed retards, see you all on Alpha Centauri. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Positions: Fuck you, the floor is 100k, ceiling  Infinity and will average sell at 500k because fuck you Kenny G 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Many have asked “How do I know the peak has passed, there will be huge swings in price and how do I know it wont go up again” I believe there will be better DD about this in the next few days but one thing I can say is that there will be momentum, when the momentum is upwards, there will definitely be dips but this dips and highs will be higher each time, the low and high of the day will have an uptrend, the opposite happens when the momentum is downward, we will see spikes and dips but they will be lower and lower, hope this helps your polished brains out!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
