  "selftext": "# The Black Swan Cometh\n\nEarlier this month, a black swan flew into the plaza of Tiananmen Square, stirring speculation on what this would symbolically mean. China has already had a rough last couple of months; dealing with floods, typhoons, hailstorms, sandstorms, landslides, and a pandemic to boot. Surely this swan is of no significance right?\n\n[Honk Honk, motherfucker. ](https://preview.redd.it/kyfhdq7nyko71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fb963e892a0b61f496c0c83e31dc4a4a08b11bf)\n\n# The Problem\n\nEnter the Chinese housing bubble. Unlike Americans which diversify into stocks, bonds, real estates etc, China largely invest in real estate. Furthermore, 40-60% of the price of real estate in mainland china is the cost of the land and taxes collected by local governments. This has led to a rapid unsustainable rise in the price of housing in some parts of China.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqil004lblo71.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4439bbf3b4bc31a936197e76c01e547920eb4ab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5u9t6w8gelo71.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=a51ac007bcfb913e4fbdc0245fc76aab77eef494\n\nAnd what does all that get you? Some shit-ass [tofu-dreg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu-dreg_project) construction housing, that makes Haitian building codes look good. Built using concrete that's more reminiscent of dirt, rebar that's more reminiscent of twigs, these buildings were built by developers to turn a profit as quickly as possible, and bought by individuals who seek to sell them at a higher price to the next sucker. This process can perpetuate itself until a catalyst presents itself.\n\n[Bo the builder asks: Can we fix it?! \\\\\"No, it's fucked!\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/9cukb29oblo71.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c94d9474d77a150b3cb2ce66888aa224a66d1bf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The catalyst: Evergrande\n\nEnter the catalyst to China's housing bubble, Evergrande: China's second largest real estate developer. On September 8th, Evergrande Wealth, which offers wealth management products to clients in China, failed to deliver interest payment to its clients. As a result, victims and clients have staged large scale protests at Evergrande HQ for several days in a row.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ef3gorv34lo71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=78722f8ffcce2762446c593a28534263a7a97b54\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[People take turns talking shit at an Evergrande Wealth exec while some lady is passed out on the floor.](https://preview.redd.it/o8z9f8ckulo71.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6db2ae9c7feec465d0be2169cc0865d534ef4f0)\n\nOn August 31, Evergrande confessed that work on 1.5 million properties have been halted due to delays in payment to its creditors, suppliers, and contractors. After absorbing $7.5B USD in wealth product deposits, Evergrande Wealth purchased $12.4B of junk assets that Evergrande could not sell.\n\n[Unfinished 'ghost city' properties](https://preview.redd.it/6rx9okgpulo71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c474a852f5493b66dcd7e0b7a6241b1bf9f30c7)\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvergrande was due a loan payment today (September 20), but told banks it was unable to pay it. Evergrande is due to pay $83.5 million in interest on **September 23** for its March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million in interest due on **September 29** for its March 2024 notes. Being unable to pay any of these loan obligations, Evergrande has resorted to offering it's properties as payment, triggering a fire sale. This is similar to the firesale of mortgage backed securities back in 2008.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24z895o4clo71.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=8435469f9054774085502485c3be757afd303567\n\n# The Contagion\n\nChina Evergrande Group employs over 200,000 full time employees across multiple sectors including real estate, renewable energy vehicles, tourism, sports, finance, and health; and indirectly provides over 38 million jobs across China. Over 1.5m customers / clients have a vested interest in Evergrande. If Evergrande defaults, it could create an unemployment crisis and panic sale of real investment properties, perpetuating the cycle above, popping the bubble. Millions would be underwater on their mortgage loans (which mind you, is really fucking expensive given the outrageous pricing of the homes) From here, we can reasonably identify the following as potential contagions.\n\n* Holders of Evergrande Bonds maturing soon: HSBS, UBS, Blackrock all have sizeable positions.\n* Commodities / Precious Metals: China is known to hold metal reserves and can/will dump them.\n* Chinese consumer discretionary sector: Consumer discretionary spending in China should fall should a recession hit the Country\n* Chinese financials sector: They are too interwoven into the real estate sector.\n* Chinese real estate sector: Self explanatory.\n* China trade partners (deficit): China has a trade deficit of $140B to Taiwan, $61B to Australia, and $60B to South Korea as of 2020. Companies in these countries that are dependent on Chinese trade may take a hit.\n* Millions of Chinese citizens stricken with debt and underwater properties: Expect a reduction in consumer buying power if this happens.\n* Chinese Government: In 2020, land transfer fees accounted for 46% of national revenue, and 84% of local government revenue. Some cities rely 100% on land revenue for income.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Cataclysm\n\nIf China's real estate bubble bursts, it can take out China's financials and Real Estate companies. S&P Global reported that over $50b in Real Estate bonds are due in 2021, and the rate of companies defaulting on bonds is rising. This contagion can easily spread to world financial sectors that are overexposed in Chinese real estate Junk Bonds.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27i8h9yv9mo71.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=c524d7577b81b5e4e431b64e01bf5600e9c532c3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lpqmwojy9mo71.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=3345c6a1aa65ab751b10b3a686e9e145aa18ce21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grp68v7r4lo71.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=5be06ab6c9d032f80e51cabcfad8efb7de28af7e\n\n# Salt the Wound\n\nTo make matters worse, recent events in China is throwing in bonus catalysts into the mix, potentially magnifying the fallout of a total collapse.\n\n* Business and Stock Market crackdown / interference: The CCP has prevented companies from listing on US stock exchanges (thus preventing its companies from acquiring new liquidity), applied regulatory pressures to the gaming, communications, education, and media sectors. Furthermore, the CCP has applied a narrative that is pro-chinese, anti-foreigner, creating hostile environments for foreign businesses to work with China.\n* Zero Covid Policy: The CCP is taking extreme measures to prevent a delta covid outbreak or another mutation. This has led to governments taking steps to place its citizens in mandatory quarantine and shut down select business sectors.\n* Lying Flat: Millennial in China are silently protesting working conditions and the rat race by laying flat.\n* Huarong Distressed Bank Bailout: In 2018, Lai Xiaomin was executed for embezzling and fucking over their state owned distressed debt management company, Huarong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ok stfu so how do I make some fuckkkinn $$$$$???\n\nBased on my DD, I am taking up bear positions on:\n\n* ASHR: Shenzhen / Shanghai A-Share ETF - Direct exposure to Chinese Stocks\n* EWH: Hong Kong Index ETF - A lot of Chinese companies list here due to better liquidity\n* MCHI: China broad ETF - A catch all ETF for Chinese exposure\n* WYNN: An overleveraged 116% debt-to-equity US headquartered Casino where over 50% of its revenues come from Macau China in midst of a gambling crackdown and potential recessionary implosion (This is affected by consumer discretionary sector swings)\n* Others: See image below\n\n^(Not financial advice, do your own DD.)\n\n[Positions, adding more Monday](https://preview.redd.it/bx16jg849lo71.png?width=2313&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0c386d1499a2c8a2c12a328d5d1c7a4a870f050)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5lvwayxx4lo71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=59e5178c56f26893fb103d13299c59c6584278ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un6wtshy4lo71.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=904489eb796945c104a9933deb423d492c48b0bf\n\n# Counter-Case\n\nu/Ropirito's dd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp1obi/beke_yang_noah_big_profits_off_the_collapse_of/):\n\n1. Bailing  them out would encourage other retards in the sector to follow the same  path of reckless borrowing (this has happened twice before on a smaller  scale). However, it may prevent damage to millions of Chinese  homeowners that would stir discontent and weaken the CCP.\n2. The  problem is simply too huge. In the name of development and GDP, Xi gave  Evergrande a free pass and $300B worth of Yuan would need to be printed  to cover them. Not only would this devalue the Yuan but it makes up **2.1%** of China’s GDP. This is simply a case where the concept of “too big to fail” may not actually be valid.\n3. Even  if a bailout did occur, that’s not a good look. Consumer confidence  would decrease rapidly and other firms would continue to push new market  bubbles under the assumption that a bailout will always be available.  Volatility in prices would increase rapidly as there would be confusion  between how the PRC prices property versus individual developers. This  would reflect uncertainty in the general stock market as well as a  bailout indicating weakness in stocks and the overall economy’s  stability.\n4. [Fuck you, China bulls - China](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/asia-pacific-business/article-china-evergrande-is-not-too-big-to-fail-editor-of-state-backed/)\n5. Even if China bails out its companies and citizens underwater and stricken with debt, that does not mean your shitty VIE ADRs \"representing one share\" of a cayman island shell company will get the same treatment. Daily reminder that Chinese investments are always inherently risky. They are the only stocks that don't comply with PCAOB audits, so financial valuations can be hot garbage for all they care. Financials presented to foreigners are also separate from what they keep at home, SEC has a 2024 deadline to comply with PCAOB or get delisted. If you think that China bailing out its people will save your precious VIE ADR as a foreigner then LMAO\n\nFurther Reading: [https://twitter.com/inartecarlodoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=21](https://twitter.com/inartecarlodoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=21)\n\n# TLDR; I think China is 没办法 for realsies this time, so I'm short China using ASHR, EWH, MCHI, WYNN.",

China has already had a rough last couple of months; dealing with floods, typhoons, hailstorms, sandstorms, landslides, and a pandemic to boot. Surely this swan is of no significance right?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kyfhdq7nyko71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fb963e892a0b61f496c0c83e31dc4a4a08b11bf\">Honk Honk, motherfucker. </a></p>\n\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n\n<p>Enter the Chinese housing bubble. Unlike Americans which diversify into stocks, bonds, real estates etc, China largely invest in real estate. Furthermore, 40-60% of the price of real estate in mainland china is the cost of the land and taxes collected by local governments. This has led to a rapid unsustainable rise in the price of housing in some parts of China.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fqil004lblo71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4439bbf3b4bc31a936197e76c01e547920eb4ab\">https://preview.redd.it/fqil004lblo71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4439bbf3b4bc31a936197e76c01e547920eb4ab</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5u9t6w8gelo71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a51ac007bcfb913e4fbdc0245fc76aab77eef494\">https://preview.redd.it/5u9t6w8gelo71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a51ac007bcfb913e4fbdc0245fc76aab77eef494</a></p>\n\n<p>And what does all that get you? Some shit-ass <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu-dreg_project\">tofu-dreg</a> construction housing, that makes Haitian building codes look good. Built using concrete that&#39;s more reminiscent of dirt, rebar that&#39;s more reminiscent of twigs, these buildings were built by developers to turn a profit as quickly as possible, and bought by individuals who seek to sell them at a higher price to the next sucker. This process can perpetuate itself until a catalyst presents itself.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9cukb29oblo71.png?width=553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c94d9474d77a150b3cb2ce66888aa224a66d1bf\">Bo the builder asks: Can we fix it?! \\&quot;No, it&#39;s fucked!\\&quot;</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>The catalyst: Evergrande</h1>\n\n<p>Enter the catalyst to China&#39;s housing bubble, Evergrande: China&#39;s second largest real estate developer. On September 8th, Evergrande Wealth, which offers wealth management products to clients in China, failed to deliver interest payment to its clients. As a result, victims and clients have staged large scale protests at Evergrande HQ for several days in a row.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ef3gorv34lo71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78722f8ffcce2762446c593a28534263a7a97b54\">https://preview.redd.it/ef3gorv34lo71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78722f8ffcce2762446c593a28534263a7a97b54</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o8z9f8ckulo71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6db2ae9c7feec465d0be2169cc0865d534ef4f0\">People take turns talking shit at an Evergrande Wealth exec while some lady is passed out on the floor.</a></p>\n\n<p>On August 31, Evergrande confessed that work on 1.5 million properties have been halted due to delays in payment to its creditors, suppliers, and contractors. After absorbing $7.5B USD in wealth product deposits, Evergrande Wealth purchased $12.4B of junk assets that Evergrande could not sell.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6rx9okgpulo71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c474a852f5493b66dcd7e0b7a6241b1bf9f30c7\">Unfinished &#39;ghost city&#39; properties</a></p>\n\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n\n<p>Evergrande was due a loan payment today (September 20), but told banks it was unable to pay it. Evergrande is due to pay $83.5 million in interest on <strong>September 23</strong> for its March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million in interest due on <strong>September 29</strong> for its March 2024 notes. Being unable to pay any of these loan obligations, Evergrande has resorted to offering it&#39;s properties as payment, triggering a fire sale. This is similar to the firesale of mortgage backed securities back in 2008.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/24z895o4clo71.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8435469f9054774085502485c3be757afd303567\">https://preview.redd.it/24z895o4clo71.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8435469f9054774085502485c3be757afd303567</a></p>\n\n<h1>The Contagion</h1>\n\n<p>China Evergrande Group employs over 200,000 full time employees across multiple sectors including real estate, renewable energy vehicles, tourism, sports, finance, and health; and indirectly provides over 38 million jobs across China. Over 1.5m customers / clients have a vested interest in Evergrande. If Evergrande defaults, it could create an unemployment crisis and panic sale of real investment properties, perpetuating the cycle above, popping the bubble. Millions would be underwater on their mortgage loans (which mind you, is really fucking expensive given the outrageous pricing of the homes) From here, we can reasonably identify the following as potential contagions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Holders of Evergrande Bonds maturing soon: HSBS, UBS, Blackrock all have sizeable positions.</li>\n<li>Commodities / Precious Metals: China is known to hold metal reserves and can/will dump them.</li>\n<li>Chinese consumer discretionary sector: Consumer discretionary spending in China should fall should a recession hit the Country</li>\n<li>Chinese financials sector: They are too interwoven into the real estate sector.</li>\n<li>Chinese real estate sector: Self explanatory.</li>\n<li>China trade partners (deficit): China has a trade deficit of $140B to Taiwan, $61B to Australia, and $60B to South Korea as of 2020. Companies in these countries that are dependent on Chinese trade may take a hit.</li>\n<li>Millions of Chinese citizens stricken with debt and underwater properties: Expect a reduction in consumer buying power if this happens.</li>\n<li>Chinese Government: In 2020, land transfer fees accounted for 46% of national revenue, and 84% of local government revenue. Some cities rely 100% on land revenue for income.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>The Cataclysm</h1>\n\n<p>If China&#39;s real estate bubble bursts, it can take out China&#39;s financials and Real Estate companies. S&amp;P Global reported that over $50b in Real Estate bonds are due in 2021, and the rate of companies defaulting on bonds is rising. This contagion can easily spread to world financial sectors that are overexposed in Chinese real estate Junk Bonds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/27i8h9yv9mo71.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c524d7577b81b5e4e431b64e01bf5600e9c532c3\">https://preview.redd.it/27i8h9yv9mo71.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c524d7577b81b5e4e431b64e01bf5600e9c532c3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lpqmwojy9mo71.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3345c6a1aa65ab751b10b3a686e9e145aa18ce21\">https://preview.redd.it/lpqmwojy9mo71.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3345c6a1aa65ab751b10b3a686e9e145aa18ce21</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/grp68v7r4lo71.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5be06ab6c9d032f80e51cabcfad8efb7de28af7e\">https://preview.redd.it/grp68v7r4lo71.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5be06ab6c9d032f80e51cabcfad8efb7de28af7e</a></p>\n\n<h1>Salt the Wound</h1>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, recent events in China is throwing in bonus catalysts into the mix, potentially magnifying the fallout of a total collapse.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Business and Stock Market crackdown / interference: The CCP has prevented companies from listing on US stock exchanges (thus preventing its companies from acquiring new liquidity), applied regulatory pressures to the gaming, communications, education, and media sectors. Furthermore, the CCP has applied a narrative that is pro-chinese, anti-foreigner, creating hostile environments for foreign businesses to work with China.</li>\n<li>Zero Covid Policy: The CCP is taking extreme measures to prevent a delta covid outbreak or another mutation. This has led to governments taking steps to place its citizens in mandatory quarantine and shut down select business sectors.</li>\n<li>Lying Flat: Millennial in China are silently protesting working conditions and the rat race by laying flat.</li>\n<li>Huarong Distressed Bank Bailout: In 2018, Lai Xiaomin was executed for embezzling and fucking over their state owned distressed debt management company, Huarong.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Ok stfu so how do I make some fuckkkinn $$$$$???</h1>\n\n<p>Based on my DD, I am taking up bear positions on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ASHR: Shenzhen / Shanghai A-Share ETF - Direct exposure to Chinese Stocks</li>\n<li>EWH: Hong Kong Index ETF - A lot of Chinese companies list here due to better liquidity</li>\n<li>MCHI: China broad ETF - A catch all ETF for Chinese exposure</li>\n<li>WYNN: An overleveraged 116% debt-to-equity US headquartered Casino where over 50% of its revenues come from Macau China in midst of a gambling crackdown and potential recessionary implosion (This is affected by consumer discretionary sector swings)</li>\n<li>Others: See image below</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><sup>Not financial advice, do your own DD.</sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bx16jg849lo71.png?width=2313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0c386d1499a2c8a2c12a328d5d1c7a4a870f050\">Positions, adding more Monday</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5lvwayxx4lo71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e5178c56f26893fb103d13299c59c6584278ec\">https://preview.redd.it/5lvwayxx4lo71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e5178c56f26893fb103d13299c59c6584278ec</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/un6wtshy4lo71.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=904489eb796945c104a9933deb423d492c48b0bf\">https://preview.redd.it/un6wtshy4lo71.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=904489eb796945c104a9933deb423d492c48b0bf</a></p>\n\n<h1>Counter-Case</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Ropirito\">u/Ropirito</a>&#39;s dd <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp1obi/beke_yang_noah_big_profits_off_the_collapse_of/\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bailing  them out would encourage other retards in the sector to follow the same  path of reckless borrowing (this has happened twice before on a smaller  scale). However, it may prevent damage to millions of Chinese  homeowners that would stir discontent and weaken the CCP.</li>\n<li>The  problem is simply too huge. In the name of development and GDP, Xi gave  Evergrande a free pass and $300B worth of Yuan would need to be printed  to cover them. Not only would this devalue the Yuan but it makes up <strong>2.1%</strong> of China’s GDP. This is simply a case where the concept of “too big to fail” may not actually be valid.</li>\n<li>Even  if a bailout did occur, that’s not a good look. Consumer confidence  would decrease rapidly and other firms would continue to push new market  bubbles under the assumption that a bailout will always be available.  Volatility in prices would increase rapidly as there would be confusion  between how the PRC prices property versus individual developers. This  would reflect uncertainty in the general stock market as well as a  bailout indicating weakness in stocks and the overall economy’s  stability.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/asia-pacific-business/article-china-evergrande-is-not-too-big-to-fail-editor-of-state-backed/\">Fuck you, China bulls - China</a></li>\n<li>Even if China bails out its companies and citizens underwater and stricken with debt, that does not mean your shitty VIE ADRs &quot;representing one share&quot; of a cayman island shell company will get the same treatment. Daily reminder that Chinese investments are always inherently risky. They are the only stocks that don&#39;t comply with PCAOB audits, so financial valuations can be hot garbage for all they care. Financials presented to foreigners are also separate from what they keep at home, SEC has a 2024 deadline to comply with PCAOB or get delisted. If you think that China bailing out its people will save your precious VIE ADR as a foreigner then LMAO</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Further Reading: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/inartecarlodoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=21\">https://twitter.com/inartecarlodoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=21</a></p>\n\n<h1>TLDR; I think China is 没办法 for realsies this time, so I&#39;m short China using ASHR, EWH, MCHI, WYNN.</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
