Bullish or Bearish? What kind of 4D chess would that be? Think about it, seems kind of plausible and this kid is basically scumbag Steve based on his post history before and after his wsb posts. So is the psyop \"Oh I should've just held forever, despite bleeding\" thus building stronger solidarity within this sub?",
