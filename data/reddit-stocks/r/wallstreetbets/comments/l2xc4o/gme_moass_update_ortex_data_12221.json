I&#39;m attaching an image from ORTEX after today&#39;s beautiful share price action. You bet that GME will be making news rounds all over the world after today, over the weekend. We&#39;re only getting started. If any of you have read my MOASS price target post from around a week or so ago**, you would know that I kept on hammering the term &#39;zero point&#39; over and over. It just means it&#39;s the starting point (whether it&#39;s your portfolio value, or the share price, or both) prior to a face-ripping MOASS. Well, if you&#39;ve held on to GME the entire time since that post, congratulations. Your zero point has just grown a substantial amount, <strong>especially</strong> after today&#39;s close @ +51.08% (as per Yahoo! Finance GME closing price). GME today even touched ~+-80% intra-day @ $76.76, breaking the previous Share Price ALL-TIME-HIGH of $63.77 (dated Dec. 7, 2008) from <strong><em>~13 years ago</em></strong> (data gathered using TD-ToS trading platform), <em>and then, closing at the new share price ALL-TIME-HIGH closing price @</em> $65.01 (as per Y! Finance GME). It&#39;s some fucking tendie-town shit.</p>\n\n<p>All the mathematical power and beauty of consecutive-day compounding interest is now to GME LONGS&#39; advantage. The inverse is true for shorts: they&#39;re getting seriously fucked by many things; face-ripping, ass-gaping, wife-fucking compounding interest only one among them. (Also, RIP to Citron Research AKA. Andrew &quot;Left for Dead&quot; Shitron.) Yeah, you read that shit right: SHORTS are about to get inflicted with MAXIMUM MATHEMATICAL PAIN. It sounds nerdy af I know, but ain&#39;t that the truth.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on GME short metrics &amp; data, and so I leave it to the experts to hopefully analyze what I&#39;m attaching here, hence a discussion thread. <em>AKA. WHAT DO THESE CRAYONS ON THE SCREEN MEAN, DADDY?</em></p>\n\n<p>However: based off off what I see on the data attached, I have come to believe that shorts have started to unwind their positions, albeit <strong><em>only slightly</em></strong>, relative to the entire short position. (I could be wrong, and if so, let me know in the comments. Let&#39;s discuss.) Still, as the data presents below, it seems that the SHARES SHORTED still stands at a HISTORIC &gt;100%, at 102.29%. <em>Goddamn. My asscheeks just clenched a little writing and thinking about all the trapped shorts (RIP). What an absolutely titanic and colossal failure of risk management.</em> Can&#39;t complain though lmao. <em>Tendies all day, everyday, bitch!</em></p>\n\n<p>Again remember, on WSB, we take into account TRADEABLE % of FLOAT, where, according to some DDs posted in the sub, is estimated to be running at around 200%+, due to (we, at the very least, assume) &#39;<em>fixed&#39;</em> massive institutional and insider ownership, that cannot/will not/<em>might not</em> sell, <em>all while</em> the shorts are fucking drowning and thrashing around, desperate to get some breathable air--in the middle of the goddamn <em>Atlantic Ocean</em> with no boats nor ships in sight. It&#39;s like <em>Titanic</em>, but they&#39;re Jack, and you&#39;re <em>the sexy-ass rich bitch</em> named Rose. Only one survives. <em>(Spoiler alert: It ain&#39;t Jack.)</em></p>\n\n<p>All said, I think we have a ways to go before all the shorts are fully covered (<em>we&#39;re talking potential MULTIPLES of current price, and, ergo, your DADDY-AS-FUCK GME PORTFOLIO)</em> e.g. more tendies to come. Focus, get ready, and have a plan. This could be <em>THE</em> trade of your lifetime.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xquiruns9yc61.jpg?width=7659&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d6d13ea9895a57c80ced0e43c6ebd00b702834c\">CRAYONS TO TENDIE-TOWN, BITCH. / You like that, daddy?

Even the Benzinga hosts couldn&#39;t fucking believe it themselves. Appreciate the good work, brother. Fucking cheers!! Maybe Ryan Cohen next? 😎</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>GME = WHALE-MAKER</strong> 🐳 🐳🐳🐳</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long live WSB, and Long live GME. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions</strong>: 100% GME. Diversified at 2/3 in Shares, 1/3 in April calls, and I rode these fuckers to war even during and after the <strong>Q3ER</strong> share price crash, due to paper hands and heavy short-seller action. <strong>#WeRemember</strong> and <strong>#WeWillNeverForget.</strong> <strong>NOW, it&#39;s time for the Shorts to pay lmao.</strong> (Current Value in $ : <em>more than tree fiddy,</em> and <em>more than enough</em> <em>to finance</em> Andrew &quot;Left for dead&quot; Citron&#39;s onlyfans as a tax-deductible charity expense.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: none of the content of this post is to imply any right/wrong financial decision.

Shorts, you have been warned.</a></p>\n\n<p>edit 4: added an important comment, thanks to <a href=\"/u/otto989\">u/otto989</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/u/otto989\">u/otto989</a>: <em>Hold up it says Thursday, Jan 21 at the bottom right of the chart. I&#39;m as curious as all of you about SI after today but want to make sure these numbers are right.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/fieryskyes\">u/fieryskyes</a>: <em>Hey man, good catch! Actually, the numbers CHANGED while posting this entire thing, RIGHT AFTER today&#39;s close. I literally had to re-type the data. The graph, I will agree, however shows Thursday 21st. Not sure what to make of that exactly. We will keep updating on this for sure. But from what I remember, the &quot;%FREEFLOAT ON LOAN&quot; data changed from 98.68% to 102.29% (as it stands now). Good comment. I will include this in the post itself.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yea, the &quot;%Free float on loan&quot; actually increased by ~3.5% while I was posting/writing this, as the CLOSING BELL struck (I use TD Ameritrade&#39;s Thinkorswim platform like a real trading daddy should, and it rings the bell at close 4PM EST SHARP. So ya I fucking remember that moment like a Pavlovian bitch.) It <em>could</em> mean that the ORTEX data reflected up-to-date data then. Fucking coincidence, amirite? Regardless, WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO before all short positions are covered, if they even have started to cover today in the first place. So chill, daddy, it&#39;s all under control and shit. Sit back, relax, and continue to jerk off to your KINGLY GME gains.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t worry my brothers, I will keep on watching ORTEX data, even on Monday. We will track this bitch in every possible way. <em>Shorts will not get out alive.</em> Also, you can get ORTEX data yourself, with a free 7-day trial period. Not affiliated with them in any way. Just consider it if you want the raw data for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
