It's been another 10 minutes, still waiting.\n\nIs someone missing shares? Is this the first crack in the basket? I don't know, but LFG 🚀🚀🚀\n\nEdit: I am on hold for a third time. He is saying he isn't seeing the confirmation going through, he is getting on with a help desk of some sort for support. Says it's probably because I exercised on a day other than friday. Call time now at 42 mins.\n\nEdit: 53 mins in. Call is done. I recorded from about the 20 min mark. Will have to edit down due to hold music forever and personal info. He said they had to wait for locates and I will be receiving my shares tomorrow. I'm too smooth brained to know if this is normal or not, so I leave that for your own interpretations. ",
