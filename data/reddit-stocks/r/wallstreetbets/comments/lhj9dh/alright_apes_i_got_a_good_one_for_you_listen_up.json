Senseonics. </p>\n\n<p>Their product is better than everything on the market and extremely price competitive. they have a 90 say sensor implant for diabetes patients out now. Their competitors only have a 15 day sensor and costs like 3 times as much. health insurance covers the eversense sensor by senseonics. they have a 180 day sensor about to be approved by the fda and a 360 day sensor both of which are available in europe right now. Their competitors dexcom has a 38 billion market cap and right now SENS has a 1 billion market cap. SENS is currently trading at $3.80 and will hit $10 soon. It could easily 10x in the next year and take over the market. SENS to the moon 💎 👊 🦧 💪 together!</p>\n\n<p>Here is some more DD from <a href=\"/u/whodisdani\">u/whodisdani</a> </p>\n\n<p>Alright guys, sorry for the late reply I gave my very best as I do this one of the first times ... maybe I am approaching this wrongly or interpreting this wrongly.</p>\n\n<p>reporting back from my research: first of all I am not an accountant / economics student (I am an software engineering student who had a little bit of accounting, gave my very best to analyse the stuff) maybe if someone could double check (will link the infos and datasources):</p>\n\n<p>the company made -94 millions in the last year, hence quite a bit away of being break even. In 2020 in comparison to their previous years their revenue operating revenue fell over 50%. This seems to be a covid related issue. In the last two quarters of 2020 they had some income, however, still far from profitable.</p>\n\n<p>​</p>\n\n<p>I tried to break this down into this new 180 day device thing you mentioned, since I had no idea what this is, I went reading into this.</p>\n\n<p>So I created the following calculation (I may be completely off, if so, say this pls): SENS reported that with their new alliance with Ascenia, they will be able to launch the product in Europe. With their operation revenues of 10&#39;016&#39;000 they have approximately 101&#39;000 customers (based on a product price of 99.-). If they are able to expand again (as they did over the last few years) their operating revenue in the US would look something like this (I took the quarterly data, removed the huge spikes and this gave me something of a growth rate like this)</p>\n\n<p>:</p>\n\n<p>Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021\n11&#39;531&#39;000  13&#39;087&#39;000  14&#39;853&#39;000  16&#39;857&#39;000\nThis would lead to an increase in market share of SENS from 0.3% to 0.5%.</p>\n\n<p>Calculation market share SENS:</p>\n\n<p>Country Diabetes    Product cost    Operating revenue   Customers   Market share\nUSA 12.2020 30&#39;000&#39;000  99  10&#39;016&#39;000  101&#39;000 0.3%\nUSA 12.2021 30&#39;000&#39;000  99  16&#39;857&#39;000  170&#39;000 0.5%\n​</p>\n\n<p>I tried to consider the expansion into the European countries as well, with the same market share as in the US.</p>\n\n<p>​</p>\n\n<p>Country Diabetes    Product cost    Operating revenue   Customers   Market share\nSwitzerland 500&#39;000 99  250&#39;000 2&#39;500   0.5%\nGermany 9&#39;500&#39;000   99  4&#39;700&#39;000   47&#39;500  0.5%\nItaly   3&#39;300&#39;000   99  1&#39;630&#39;000   16&#39;500  0.5%\nNetherland  1&#39;300&#39;000   99  640&#39;000 6&#39;500   0.5%\nPoland  2&#39;300&#39;000   99  1&#39;130&#39;000   11&#39;500  0.5%\nSpain   3&#39;600&#39;000   99  1&#39;780&#39;000   18&#39;000  0.5%\n​</p>\n\n<p>With this kind of growth, the operating revenue would nearly triple from this year to the end of next year. However, I have no idea if I have done stuff correctly, nor does this have any scientific value. As I said, I did not study anything related to stocks.</p>\n\n<p>​</p>\n\n<p>finances: <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SENS/financials?p=SENS\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SENS/financials?p=SENS</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.senseonics.com/investor-relations/news-releases/2020/08-10-2020-210756286\">https://www.senseonics.com/investor-relations/news-releases/2020/08-10-2020-210756286</a></p>\n\n<p>product price: <a href=\"https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/senseonics-launches-program-low-cost-eversense-cgm-systems\">https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/senseonics-launches-program-low-cost-eversense-cgm-systems</a></p>\n\n<p>diabetes patients usa: <a href=\"https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/senseonics-launches-program-low-cost-eversense-cgm-systems\">https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/senseonics-launches-program-low-cost-eversense-cgm-systems</a></p>\n\n<p>Europe diabetes patients: <a href=\"https://idf.org/our-network/regions-members/europe/members/152-poland.html\">https://idf.org/our-network/regions-members/europe/members/152-poland.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: just that I have mentioned it once I‘m not a financial advisor.
