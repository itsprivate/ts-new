Ive just got back home from my wageslave job as a stonemason, where we make granite/quartz worktops for people considerably richer than we are. </p>\n\n<p>The story goes as follows: today was just like any other wagecuck day goes boring, monotonous grinding/polishing kitchen tops. At one point there was a really big island worktop, or &quot;countertop&quot; as our American brothers may say. These granite worktops can be really heavy under certain circumstances and today this particular one was and it took two of us to lift it to put a table underneath it to support the granite. </p>\n\n<p>On the way down, laying the granite on the table the third man moved the table too close to mine and my co workers fingers, or lets say hands. Now despite the pain of a couple hundred kg of granite trapping my hands between it and the table, I remained calm. Yet on the other hand my co worker quickly pulled his hands out from underneath as it crushed his fingers essentially tearing his fingers open from the metal table and sharp granite. Nothing major just a few cuts. However yours truly, as I&#39;ve said: remained calm and simply stated my hands were stuck under the granite, so after a bit of panic fellow co-workers managed to lift the heavy granite off and there my fingers were. Intacted. </p>\n\n<p>It was almost as if you could suggest ones hand was made of some material made from intense pressure???</p>\n\n<p>So, the moral of the story is when under pressure the key is to remain calm and keep your eyes on the end goal. Then make sure don&#39;t get distracted and throw yourself to panic as you can very much make the whole situation worse than it actually is. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways imma send a buy order for a thousand shares of GME tomorrow 💎🙏s BAYBEYYY LETS GOOOOOOOOO 🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
