Honestly, I already confirmed their studies to be true in college.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, MindMed has been trading OTC in like Canada&#39;s market or something (I guess there are companies that exist outside the USA) so only brokers that allow OTC trading let you buy it. As of today though not anymore!</p>\n\n<p>They announced that they will begin trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, April 27, 2021 under the symbol: MNMD.</p>\n\n<p>Reasons I invested:</p>\n\n<p>1 To get in before Nasdaq listing (not too late to do so)</p>\n\n<p>2 Always saw the psychedelic market to be the next drug market to boom (It still is relatively new market, more research and potential catalyst in the future)</p>\n\n<p>3 I believe in the research (our generation is like number 1 in rising depression cases and most treatment for depression sucks. This research can be revolutionary for depressed apes that Yolo&#39;d too many FDs or actual depressed apes that aren&#39;t retards.[Edit: Other mental health issues they are studying to treat are; anxiety, addiction and ADHD])</p>\n\n<p>4 Kevin O&#39;leary AKA Mr. Wonderful is invested in it (I usually don&#39;t buy into celebrity endorsements but Mr. Wonderful believes in the company and he doesn&#39;t invest in something he would lose money in. Also he did mention MindMed to Cathie Wood in a four panel interview on CNBC a week or two ago. So possible Cathie Wood interest after listing)</p>\n\n<p>5 Nasdaq listing allows more money to flow in (after April 27 robinhood retards can throw YOLO money into it)</p>\n\n<p>6 I like the Stock</p>\n\n<p>The only disclaimer is that I am not a financial advisor and this would&#39;ve been a YOLO post if I didn&#39;t lose so much money on stupid PLTR calls</p>\n\n<p>Mods plz this is my first legit post here ever</p>\n\n<p>edited a lil more info</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
