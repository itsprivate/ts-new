However, I’m not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR - First, intro - they’re changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they’re growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill</strong></p>\n\n<p>Have you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can’t figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: “Let’s do another test. I’ll refer you to…” It seems like you’re never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn’t familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they’ve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it’s exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.</p>\n\n<p>Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>15% Concentrated Power of Will</strong></p>\n\n<p>Clover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they’re taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla’s AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5% Pleasure, 50% Pain</strong></p>\n\n<p>Last week CLOV announced new partnerships with <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html\">Upward Health</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html\">U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services</a>, expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd’s claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it’s important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of the evidence of growth, you’ll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV’s competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it’s not just a regular health insurance company, it’s a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)</p>\n\n<p>Circling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It’s because they’re constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla’s time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn’t even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - <strong>MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>If the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn’t institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they’re not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they’re looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. <strong>Institutions are not emotional.</strong> Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn’t a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you’ll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.&quot;</em> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Warren Buffett</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Like I said before, I’m not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y’all have been following Chamath as I have, you’ll know he&#39;s known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn’t deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that’s been shared.</p>\n\n<p><em>“So when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here’s what I see in a nutshell: Number one… is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I’ve ever made. It’s a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.”</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Chamath Palihapitiya</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
