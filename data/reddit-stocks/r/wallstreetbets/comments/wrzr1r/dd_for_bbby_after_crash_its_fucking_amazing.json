  "selftext": " Okay apes, I’m here with some juicy DD on $BBBY. Although today RC is drilling all our wives and  waved the flag of scumbaggery, its ok because it’s looking fucking great without him. Let me explain:\n\nHere is breakdown of what had happened, what caused the price to drop and what DIDN’T (important) cause the price to drop.\n\nBelow is a chart showing RC selling his shares periodically (this is done to prevent huge movements).\n\nOn 8/16 ---  RC started selling at a price of $18/share, this price was on the charts around 10:20am (very important will explain later), by the end of the day he had sold 5,000,000 shares with prices ranging from $18 to $26 per share.\n\non the next day, 8/17 ---- RC sold 2,780,000 shares, with prices ranging from $23 to $29\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sec.gov\\/Archives\\/edgar\\/data\\/886158\\/000092189522002496\\/sc13da313351002\\_08182022.htm](https://preview.redd.it/m43f4k6xeki91.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86f884c3b0754ca17cb60843dab0bbd61a67b6b7)\n\nSo now we know he sold 5 million on 8/16 and 2.7 million on 8/17. But do you remember what the chart looked like on 8/17 when market opened? after RC had already sold 5 million shares the day prior…well let me show you this juice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you look at the chart below, on morning of 8/16, there was one dip before we climbed to a high of $29/share, that dip was around the same price that RC started selling around the price of $18 as shown on the chart above, yet we continued to climb. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8naldg5fki91.png?width=830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=484750bd3e9ae660646c9cc6f8c2b297d273dcd5\n\nWhy though? Why did we continue to climb? Because we had no fucking idea that he was selling. This will get so much juicer just wait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe chart below shows that at 4pm on 8/16, the price closed with a low of $18, at that point, 5 MILLION shares have been sold by RC (the bigger and first chunk that was sold). But we had no fucking clue, yet the following day, we mooned first thing after opening as you can see below, and held at even higher than the day before, we recovered like it was nothing, and held a good floor. All of this happened after RC had sold 5 million shares the day prior + most of his second batch which was selling periodically throughout the day on 8/17 while we maintained a good floor level. we had such great support that his sell off did not shake the chart. below shows when we closed after 5 million of RC shales have been sold, and right after that circle is when we recovered (again we had no clue) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udjnjzprfki91.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44e6fe4391cf847804b172e1d416d5717ef0bc7f\n\nOn 8/17 (yesterday) around 3pm, FUD started coming out that ryan cohen is intending to sell his shares. Mind you, at that point he had ALREADY SOLD ALL HIS SHARES AND WE STILL HELD A HIGH PRICE OF 27$, but panic started happening thinking RC was still in and was going to sell, when he in fact had already sold everything because by this point it is 3:30pm and his shares cannot sell as a lump sum, meaning he was strategically selling through out the day yet we maintained a high. What does this mean? It means the huge drop we saw towards closing yesterday was almost purely panic selling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now on the real DD:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is data from 7/29 showing float being less than naked shorts, 28.26 million float and 29.07 million shorted, this puts the short % of float at a whooping 102.88%, textbook says 20% or higher is considered high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow since this data is not up to date, counting worst case scenario, RC sold a total of 7,780,000 shares, which were added to the float. This makes the new float around 36 million, while the short is 29 million (new data is most likely higher), this makes the new short % of float around 29/36 = 80.5%. I take pride in having a big dick, but this value is bigger than my dick could ever get. This is still huge, and this is counting worst case scenario. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faj688oxfki91.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf697dea9de5868ec83ed8149d321b8a5aca642f\n\nBut Baylish I am retarded, please simplify this to me? Ok ape, I’ll summarize like you’re 5. \n\n1.\twe had no fucking clue that RC had already sold all of his position, yet we continued climbing. This is huge, why? Because that means RC did not matter. \n\n2. we now have one less entity to worry about that could rug pull moving forward. \n\n2.\tit only started crashing once the fud came out -&gt; causing mass panic. This caused more damage than RC himself selling, in fact RC selling didn’t make a dent, this shows that sentiment goes a long way. \n\n3.\tnew tentative data shows short % still high as fuck (around 80% per morning star’s latest info)\n\n\n4. if we manage to even make slight, yet gradual rise from here and bring back the positive sentiment, we have less risks of rugpull like with RC, and we have proved absolute resilience after the worst that could happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nNot a financial advisor. I’m holding my position, because we are back to an affordable price where many can jump in if they choose to. And I believe if we get this started again, especially without a hero figure, we will be unfucking stoppable. It’s all sentiment and a little bit of price rise.\n\nthe good news is that BBBY got huge media exposure that any type of recovery WILL have all eyes on it…. In a jaw dropping way. \n\nReminder:\n\n1. GME went down 50% before it shot up. \n\n2. This sub had a fraction of its current members during GME (2m vs 12m) \n\n3. The rich will always eat the poor. The poor is helpless and weak and insignificant alone. Together, we are intimidating. It’s clear as sun how intimidated the hedgies were by all the fud that came out. Only they know our impact potential, we are just too scattered and emotionally driven \n\n4. Could u imagine the kind of FOMO that will happen if we pull this just $3-5 back up intraday after all the Psuedo bad news? \n\n5. It’s on fucking REG SHO \n\nInvest on your own risk, this could go 3 possible ways: we could shit our pants losing everything, or shit our pants seeing a turn around, or shit our pants seeing a turn around after paper handing. Choose which way you want to shit your pants. In either case, we will shit our pants. Stay well friends\n\n“When everyone is greedy that’s when you should be fearful, when everyone is fearful, it’s time to be greedy” - Warren Buffet\n\nEDIT as of 11:24 pm EST: GOLDMAN SACHS BOUGHT 1,000,000 shares worth of calls TODAY!

But do you remember what the chart looked like on 8/17 when market opened? after RC had already sold 5 million shares the day prior…well let me show you this juice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at the chart below, on morning of 8/16, there was one dip before we climbed to a high of $29/share, that dip was around the same price that RC started selling around the price of $18 as shown on the chart above, yet we continued to climb. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q8naldg5fki91.png?width=830&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=484750bd3e9ae660646c9cc6f8c2b297d273dcd5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q8naldg5fki91.png?width=830&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=484750bd3e9ae660646c9cc6f8c2b297d273dcd5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why though? Why did we continue to climb? Because we had no fucking idea that he was selling. This will get so much juicer just wait. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows that at 4pm on 8/16, the price closed with a low of $18, at that point, 5 MILLION shares have been sold by RC (the bigger and first chunk that was sold). But we had no fucking clue, yet the following day, we mooned first thing after opening as you can see below, and held at even higher than the day before, we recovered like it was nothing, and held a good floor. All of this happened after RC had sold 5 million shares the day prior + most of his second batch which was selling periodically throughout the day on 8/17 while we maintained a good floor level. we had such great support that his sell off did not shake the chart. below shows when we closed after 5 million of RC shales have been sold, and right after that circle is when we recovered (again we had no clue) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/udjnjzprfki91.png?width=936&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=44e6fe4391cf847804b172e1d416d5717ef0bc7f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/udjnjzprfki91.png?width=936&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=44e6fe4391cf847804b172e1d416d5717ef0bc7f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 8/17 (yesterday) around 3pm, FUD started coming out that ryan cohen is intending to sell his shares. Mind you, at that point he had ALREADY SOLD ALL HIS SHARES AND WE STILL HELD A HIGH PRICE OF 27$, but panic started happening thinking RC was still in and was going to sell, when he in fact had already sold everything because by this point it is 3:30pm and his shares cannot sell as a lump sum, meaning he was strategically selling through out the day yet we maintained a high. What does this mean? It means the huge drop we saw towards closing yesterday was almost purely panic selling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now on the real DD:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below is data from 7/29 showing float being less than naked shorts, 28.26 million float and 29.07 million shorted, this puts the short % of float at a whooping 102.88%, textbook says 20% or higher is considered high. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now since this data is not up to date, counting worst case scenario, RC sold a total of 7,780,000 shares, which were added to the float. This makes the new float around 36 million, while the short is 29 million (new data is most likely higher), this makes the new short % of float around 29/36 = 80.5%. I take pride in having a big dick, but this value is bigger than my dick could ever get. This is still huge, and this is counting worst case scenario. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/faj688oxfki91.png?width=936&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf697dea9de5868ec83ed8149d321b8a5aca642f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/faj688oxfki91.png?width=936&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf697dea9de5868ec83ed8149d321b8a5aca642f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Baylish I am retarded, please simplify this to me? Ok ape, I’ll summarize like you’re 5. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we had no fucking clue that RC had already sold all of his position, yet we continued climbing. This is huge, why? Because that means RC did not matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we now have one less entity to worry about that could rug pull moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it only started crashing once the fud came out -&amp;gt; causing mass panic. This caused more damage than RC himself selling, in fact RC selling didn’t make a dent, this shows that sentiment goes a long way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;new tentative data shows short % still high as fuck (around 80% per morning star’s latest info)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if we manage to even make slight, yet gradual rise from here and bring back the positive sentiment, we have less risks of rugpull like with RC, and we have proved absolute resilience after the worst that could happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a financial advisor. I’m holding my position, because we are back to an affordable price where many can jump in if they choose to. And I believe if we get this started again, especially without a hero figure, we will be unfucking stoppable. It’s all sentiment and a little bit of price rise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the good news is that BBBY got huge media exposure that any type of recovery WILL have all eyes on it…. In a jaw dropping way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reminder:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GME went down 50% before it shot up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sub had a fraction of its current members during GME (2m vs 12m) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rich will always eat the poor. The poor is helpless and weak and insignificant alone. Together, we are intimidating. It’s clear as sun how intimidated the hedgies were by all the fud that came out. Only they know our impact potential, we are just too scattered and emotionally driven &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could u imagine the kind of FOMO that will happen if we pull this just $3-5 back up intraday after all the Psuedo bad news? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s on fucking REG SHO &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Invest on your own risk, this could go 3 possible ways: we could shit our pants losing everything, or shit our pants seeing a turn around, or shit our pants seeing a turn around after paper handing. Choose which way you want to shit your pants. In either case, we will shit our pants. Stay well friends&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“When everyone is greedy that’s when you should be fearful, when everyone is fearful, it’s time to be greedy” - Warren Buffet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT as of 11:24 pm EST: GOLDMAN SACHS BOUGHT 1,000,000 shares worth of calls TODAY!
