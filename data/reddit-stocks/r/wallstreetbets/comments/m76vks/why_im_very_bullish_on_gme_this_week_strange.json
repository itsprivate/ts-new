  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There has been a lot of strange movement in GME stock price over the past couple of weeks, but today stands out for me. There are a few points to touch on, but essentially my thesis is based on <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/fLe50gq\">today&#39;s chart so far</a> and a couple of key points.</p>\n\n<h1>Today&#39;s Chart &amp; Price Action</h1>\n\n<p>When market opened today, almost all technical indicators were very bullish for GME. This indicates that we should see some very strong bullish moves in price today.</p>\n\n<p>A quick caveat - all technical analysis, and any natural price movement really, requires volume. Without volume, the price cannot move naturally, and technical analysis/indicators will eventually exhaust and fail.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the chart today, the price action was playing out somewhat as expected. It tested an early support around $210-211 before entering a rising channel for most of the morning. Indicators remained bullish for the entire time, but volume wasn&#39;t showing up. After two down days, this was a perfect opportunity to create a massive move and gap up - potentially causing a small squeeze. But nothing happened. Volume never showed up, and the move started to become exhausted.</p>\n\n<p>At about 1PM, we started seeing the price test the lower end of the channel repeatedly. At this point, if we were going to see a bullish continuence, we would see a spike in volume to push it back up into the channel. We repeatedly didn&#39;t see this and it eventually failed. And then what happened? <strong>Nothing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This failure to maintain the bullish move was a perfect opportunity for those holding short positions to pounce. They could have used a fairly minimal amount of capital to smack the price down, and likey blow right past this morning&#39;s support of $210 and maybe even break below $200. It was a golden opportunity, and literally nothing happened. Even now, at almost 2PM it is still trading sideways on virtually no volume.</p>\n\n<p>Both sides of this trade, long and short, were presented with golden opportunities throughout this morning. Both sides chose not to act. Why?</p>\n\n<h1>Gamma Squeezes</h1>\n\n<p>In order to continue, and explain my thesis, I need to explain a bit about gamma squeezes. <strong>I also think this will be helpful to many people, because there is a ton of misconception that spreads about how gamma squeezes work.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gamma squeezes are a result of open interest in options and hedging by the market makers holding the options. People also misinterpret volume as open interest. Volume on options is for the most part irrelevant. What matters is how many total calls are open at each strike price. When a market makers sells a call option, they must remain risk neutral. In order to do so they need to buy shares of the underlying stock as the call becomes more likely to expire in the money. In a very simplistic form: let&#39;s say there is currently a 50% chance a 230c ends up in the money at the end of the week. The market maker would buy 50 shares now to hedge their risk. As it becomes more or less likely through price movement and theta decay, they&#39;ll either sell or buy more shares to remain risk neutral.</p>\n\n<p>This leads us to the most common misinformation I see spread here and other places regarding gamma squeezes. <em>There are currently 250,000 calls ITM, so if we hold above this by Friday there will be a gamma squeeze.</em> That is not how it works. The strike prices that are currently in the money are probably considered 90+% likely to be in the money upon expiration, which means they are pretty much fully hedged already. They do not remain naked on all calls and then scrambled at close on Friday to fulfill ITM contracts.</p>\n\n<p>So what causes a gamma squeeze? (This part is very important, and is the key to my entire thesis for Friday)</p>\n\n<p>A large amount of open interest becoming ITM suddenly, unexpectedly, and very close to expiration. A gamma squeeze is essentially market makers scrambling to accumulate shares to fulfill contracts that are in the money. The only scenario in which this happens is for very unexpected price movement to happen on Friday basically.</p>\n\n<h1>My Thesis</h1>\n\n<p>Short positions do not want the price to drop between now and market open on Friday. Longs want to have the highest possible number of OTM call options when markets open on Friday. Why? We need a large amount of open interest to move from OTM to ITM suddenly, unexpectedly and close to expiration so there is a smaller window for MM to fulfill the shares.</p>\n\n<p>If we can get down under $150 by Friday open, this gives us several strike prices in $10 increments, many of which have large open interest amounts. These strike prices can be used fairly rapidly to force unexpected need for hedging risk (aka buying shares) very quickly. If we end up opening at $250+ on Friday? Most open interest that can realistically end ITM will already be ITM and thus already fully hedged against. This means there is little to no opportunity to force a gamma squeeze. Not only does open interest go against us, but we&#39;d need to move the price up $50 to hit the next large batch of open interest, and then another $50 to the next, then after $400 it goes in $100 increments. <em>Additionally</em>, it takes an exorbitant amount of money to move the price from $250-300. It takes MUCH less to move it from $150-160. Then $160-170. And so on. And along the way you&#39;re picking up more and more buying pressure from MM hedging.</p>\n\n<p>An added bonus to keeping the price lower is it will increase the open interest in FDs by lowering the premiums at strike prices between 150-250ish, which is where we really need the most open interest. </p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Short positions desperately do not want the price to drop too much before Friday. The squeeze needs an explosive movement to trigger, and if we get down to around $150-160 before open on Friday, it will take a significantly lower amount of capital and volume to trigger a large move.</p>\n\n<p>Long positions want to see as low of a base as possible going into Friday, because it will mean a larger amount of open interest that can be used as fuel for a gamma squeeze, which could trigger the short squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT: This is all my opinion. This also is not a guarantee. For starters, I could be wrong about literally everything - I am retarded after all. Secondly, long whales have planned big attacks on Fridays before and failed every time. They could fail again this week even if I&#39;m right. The important part is that if you believe based on your research that the short interest is still over 100%, then this has to squeeze at some point. It doesn&#39;t have to happen Friday, but it does have to happen. At the end of the day, validate any DD you see on your own, do your own research, and make your own decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Apes strong together. 💎🙌🚀🌖</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
