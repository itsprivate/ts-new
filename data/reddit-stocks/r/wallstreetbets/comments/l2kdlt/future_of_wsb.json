Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that&#39;s all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It&#39;s good to have a decent amount of players here but let&#39;s keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let&#39;s keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>too many new wannabe autists</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>WSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren&#39;t true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don&#39;t agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don&#39;t even understand the last sentence.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>this isn&#39;t WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anyone who&#39;s been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it&#39;s mainly memes. It&#39;s fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to fix this?</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in <a href=\"/r/all\">r/all</a> for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.</li>\n<li>Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer&#39;s dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don&#39;t need SEC to do us what your wife&#39;s boyfriend does to your wife.</li>\n<li>GME to the moon</li>\n<li>WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It&#39;s pretty simple and if you can&#39;t accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.</li>\n<li>Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there&#39;s nothing we can do.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>positions:</p>\n\n<p>pronebone, 156 shares of TSLA, 80 shares of GME, lots of leap calls and smaller positions</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
