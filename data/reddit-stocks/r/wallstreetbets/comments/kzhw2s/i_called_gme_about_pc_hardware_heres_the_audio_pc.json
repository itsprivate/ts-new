That among some other cool details. Another associate from another store confirmed that streaming hardware will be coming first if not already in store, but actual internal components are scheduled when some stores get a new &quot;face&quot; it sounded like she said? I&#39;m guessing the 1.5 tier stores will somehow reface themselves to indicate they are PC gaming oriented stores? Likely regional hubs I&#39;d assume. They adopted a similar shipping and delivery model to Auto Zone and Advance Auto if I recall correctly. Sounds like a moon mission to me! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>I have trimmed the front of the audio file to protect the associate, and beeped our specific location area. Yes I am aware my phone and poor editing skills make me sound 13, but before you shit on me let me ask did you call and post it today? 😎</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/9jRV2S5I#h1HR_5jmufioO691XjcUi3iAD-9z1QHjjfbJu_w_OWk\">https://mega.nz/file/9jRV2S5I#h1HR_5jmufioO691XjcUi3iAD-9z1QHjjfbJu_w_OWk</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;m going to trim and edit the audio from at least one other store. Two people noted &quot;faces&quot;, but one of them also knew a little about hardware so I&#39;ll upload that as well. </p>\n\n<p>Edit #2: Here is the 2nd recording. The reps audio was low, and I am not a sound engineer but I did my best. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/Iq4ABRoA#COo0J3UuoJ4o9SyTAv1L-enlL1eYA23htsIkzfuGZRs\">https://mega.nz/file/Iq4ABRoA#COo0J3UuoJ4o9SyTAv1L-enlL1eYA23htsIkzfuGZRs</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit #3: can people tweet this @RyanCohen to get some exposure. Of course he can&#39;t say much, but the silence will tell all. I&#39;m not the social media type, RC is one of like 6 people I follow but this gaining traction could be huge. </p>\n\n<p>I should also note, someone else posted this rumor. I simply put in a little effort. I did not crack this myself. </p>\n\n<p>Legal note I apparently already need to make, I live in a one-party consent state for telecommunication recording and I will be removing all personal and specific local area references.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
