So I was chilling and doing my usual daily routine (losing money).  Then I remembered how much I love watching Kill Bill. I've seen it more than 10 times but I enjoy rewatching it every 4-5 months.  But guess what, this dumbfuck company decided to remove Kill Bill from their platform. There I was pissed and scrolling through movies, I've seen Keanu Reeves. Then, I decided that I was going to binge-watch matrix. As I was searching for the Matrix, I realized that there are Matrix parts 1 and 3. Part 2 was nowhere to be found. This made me even more pissed and I have proceeded to cancel my Netflix account. So as you all can see Netflix doing dumbfuck moves. Like why tf would someone remove part 2 and keep the rest. Doesn't make sense. Anyways I'm looking for another streaming platform where I don't have to pay. Thanks",
