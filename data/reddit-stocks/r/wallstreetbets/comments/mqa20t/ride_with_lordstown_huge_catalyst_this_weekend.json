Spoiler alert - this race is the catalyst that I discuss in my post.  🚀 🚀 🚀 </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>\n\n<p>I work at a tech company that focuses on market research for our clients, so I have developed a very extensive and thorough research process during my career. I have found that this skill has translated into success in the stock market, and I wanted to take the time to show you why my research recently led me to $RIDE.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you decide to read this post from beginning to end, you can thank me around Christmas time as $RIDE stock is currently being held down by shorts and FUD, but it will be a 4 bagger before the end of this year.</p>\n\n<p>The great thing about all of this market volatility lately has been the buying opportunities. Let me also remind you that this is wallstreetbets; not wallstreetbonds. If you’re afraid of taking risks, why are you a member of this sub anyway? I personally have no interest in putting my money in index funds or buying the blue-chip value stocks that Cramer loves recommending to boomers.</p>\n\n<p>I primarily look at fundamentals when making investments, but I actually saw a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mma558/hitch_a_ride_to_the_moon_technical_analysis_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">post on this sub</a> last week which really peaked my interest in the technicals of $RIDE too. And when I feel that a stock with rock solid fundamentals is bottoming out, that’s when I go in big. And I won’t go in big unless I feel there’s a huge catalyst on the horizon that can send the stock to pluto. 🚀 🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>$RIDE – Brief Overview</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE) was founded in 2019 and began developing their <a href=\"https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance\">full-size all electric Endurance truck</a>. They got a jump start, relative to other competitors, due to GM’s investment in exchange for their <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/\">massive 6.2 million square foot facility</a>.</p>\n\n<p>$RIDE assembled an <a href=\"https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management\">experienced management team</a> with multiple executives &amp; VPs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, Honda, Workhorse, etc. What these executives realized is that the general public isn’t ready for the mass-adoption of electric vehicles right now. So, the way to hit the ground running in this industry, is to sell their electric trucks to commercial fleets.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial fleets are literally the perfect fit for electrification. This is because, when a construction worker gets back from a long day at the job site, he can just plug his truck in to charge overnight before heading back to work the next day. Additionally, electric trucks come with a 25-30% lower total cost of ownership. This is largely because of lower maintenance costs for EVs and, in $RIDE’s case, their truck gets 75mpg equivalent (which is over 3x the mpg that a pick-up usually gets).</p>\n\n<p>Fleet managers care about efficiency and cost – so $RIDE makes their truck a no brainer for fleets. Once their trucks are on the open market <strong>this September</strong>, every fleet manager and their brother will be buying these. 🚀 🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>I also mentioned a huge upcoming catalyst earlier in this post. I saw an article last week that the $RIDE <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-lordstown-motors-124412209.html\">April 23 $20 call had some of the highest implied volatility out of all equity options that day</a>. I did some digging, and I was able to find the hidden catalyst.</p>\n\n<p>$RIDE is showing their level of confidence in their truck <strong>THIS SATURDAY (4/17)</strong> by participating in <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/ar-BB1dWYrd\">one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck</a> – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race. The event will take place at Mexico&#39;s Baja California Peninsula, and it will be publicly televised. This is called a Proof of Concept (POC), and it will showcase why $RIDE’s truck is a fleet manager’s dream. <em>No other EV companies out there have the fucking balls to sign their trucks up for something like this.</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1381955618278363138?s=20\">$RIDE has been preparing for the race</a>, and if their truck even crosses the finish line on Saturday, it will be the first EV ever to do so, and it will show just how tough the truck actually is; thus proving all of the doubters wrong.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>20 reasons to invest in $RIDE</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36017463/biden-23-trillion-infrastructure-plan-electric-cars/\">The government is proposing massive infrastructure spend</a>. This is a game-changer for EV stocks like $RIDE. It’s also huge for the construction industry, which consists of thousands of fleets that utilize full-size pick-up trucks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bringing the first full-size electric pick-up to market, <em>The</em> <em>Endurance</em>, <strong>this September</strong>. The bestselling 3 vehicles in the US are pick-up trucks – many of which operate in fleet sector. $RIDE is laser-focused on the light duty vehicle market – which will represent nearly a <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-light-duty-vehicles-market\">$1 trillion market opportunity by 2025</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/\">Backed by GM</a> who sold them a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html\">6.2 million square foot facility</a> over 2 years ago now for pennies on the dollar. 3rd most productive automotive plant in the country.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Utilizes <a href=\"https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/tech\">revolutionary all-electric In-Wheel Drive System</a> with four hub motors &amp; integrated software. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20\">This will change the automotive industry for decades to come</a>.

There was a quote from Chris that said: “Right now it&#39;s going to take us a couple of years to fulfill that demand. And that demand does not even include Federal and state vehicles, which those have to go through a procurement process, so we are primarily focused right now on meeting the commercial demand that we have.&quot;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Have been testing their skateboard chassis in both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1369663762698014724?s=20\">desert conditions</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1357335736324866048?s=20\">snowy conditions</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Have <a href=\"https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020\">over $600m cash on hand</a>, which is more than enough to get to full production this September.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Have hit <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20\">fully-automated beta production</a>, meaning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20\">robots are welding their vehicles</a>.This means they are very close to fully-automated mass-production.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Yesterday, a video was shown of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1381683369826746371?s=20\">vehicles being sent out for additional crash testing</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In the final due diligence stage for the<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-corp-advances-next-123000404.html\"> Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program</a>. Receiving this loan would be a huge catalyst for the stock, and an announcement is expected <strong>any day now</strong>. It says a lot that they are in this stage as it means the DOE has been taking a deep dive into their financials, operations, and personnel. If they are awarded the loan, this is yet another catalyst that will send this stock soaring.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The 6-month chart shows $RIDE has made this same violent move downward multiple times, and each time, made a violent move upwards shortly after. I will now explain why this time of FUD is a buying opportunity.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>$RIDE – A time of FUD creates a massive buying opportunity</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay, so what kind of DD would this be if I didn’t explain to you why the stock has plunged close to 70% from all-time-highs? I want to walk you through the 2 main things that brought the stock down and show you why this time of FUD is a buying opportunity.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Short-seller, Hindenburg Research, targeted $RIDE in a research report last month. Piece of advice – never believe a short-seller until you do your own DD. They obviously want retail investors to panic and sell the stock so they can make money on their short position. After all, Hindenburg is literally just a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055\">5-man shop</a> ran out of an <a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661\">apartment in New York</a>. I think their ego got too big after they successfully shorted Nikola. Feel free to check out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">this post</a> because it refuted all of Hindenburg’s main accusations against $RIDE.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You know a short-seller is full of BS when the state of Ohio comes to the defense of the attacked company. At the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html\">this article</a>, Senator Michael Rulli discusses how far along $RIDE is and says “anyone who was in that plant would read that short-report and think it was garbage.” Additionally, U.S. Rep Tim Ryan called the short-report a “bull-**** hatchet job for the short-seller to make money.”</p>\n\n<p>Secretary of State <a href=\"https://businessjournaldaily.com/larose-visits-lordstown-motors/\">Frank LaRose</a> also visited $RIDE’s facility to confirm how legit this operation is. Plus, Ohio Governor <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/gov-mike-dewines-grandson-hired-as-lobbyist-for-electric-vehicle-manufacturer-lordstown-motors.html\">Dewine’s Grandson works at Lordstown as a Government Affairs Lobbyist</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This shows that the state of Ohio is backing $RIDE. It helps to have friends in the right places during times like this.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Lawsuits and SEC Inquiry. Basically, there are a couple of lawsuits and an SEC probe that are looking into $RIDE’s pre-orders. $RIDE claimed to have 100,000 non-binding reservations, and there are now questions about whether or not these pre-orders are legit. This does not concern me. Like I mentioned earlier $RIDE Director of Government Relations &amp; Corporate Affairs, Chris Kerzich, already made it clear that demand is robust, and it will take them “a couple of years” to fulfill the current demand.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of this has been blown out of proportion based on my research. <a href=\"https://probesreporter.com/\">Here’s a link of some current SEC probes</a>. There are a lot of companies you know very well that are being looked at by the SEC constantly. The reality is, there are 1000’s of SEC inquiries each year into publicly traded companies. The end result is almost always a slap on the wrist. Let’s take Tesla for example. Do you remember a couple of years ago when Elon tweeted he was going to take $TSLA private at $420 a share, which was a premium to the share price at the time? That was literally stock market manipulation by Elon, and it was probably one of the most illegal things a public company could do. There were dozens of lawsuits and a full-blown SEC investigation. Well, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226\">the end result was literally just a $20 million fine for Elon and a $20 million fine for $TSLA</a>. Basically, a slap on the wrist. And that was 100x more serious than $RIDE’s non-binding pre-orders.</p>\n\n<p>The point I’m making is this: Don’t be fooled by the media. They make lawsuits and SEC involvement seem way worse than they actually are. Do your homework and invest in companies with high-growth potential when times of FUD create buying opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Look at institutional investment too. <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/ride/ownership\">Morningstar</a> and <a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/ride\">Fintel</a> show that institutions have consistently been adding $RIDE to their holdings the past couple of months.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>$RIDE is an EV growth company currently trading at a large discount (50% of their asset value). They have a $3B facility and over $600m cash on hand, but only a $1.8B market cap after the recent sell-off. Please view <a href=\"https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/ef77bce6-b19a-4288-a651-e08089f1362f\">this investor presentation</a> for any additional questions on the company. <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lordstown-motors-becomes-oversold-ride-2021-04-05\">$RIDE is massively oversold</a> right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>$RIDE</em></strong> <a href=\"https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=ride&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2\"><strong><em>short % of float is now over 21% as of today</em></strong></a><strong><em>, which is exactly the fuel we need for a massive move upwards after the Baja race this Saturday.</em></strong> 🚀 🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Remember: Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered. To me, it is apparent that shorts have gotten greedy on $RIDE. They will be forced to cover big time with this huge catalyst coming so soon.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Position:</strong></p>\n\n<p>3868 shares @ $12.22. I believe this stock will be back to its 52 week high of $32 by the end of this summer, and it will be $40 by production in September. $RIDE currently has one of the lowest market caps ($1.8B) out of all of the EV plays, yet they are the closest to mass production. They also have a huge catalyst coming this Saturday. Lots of upside here.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL:DR</strong></p>\n\n<p>$RIDE stock currently presents a great entry point. People who are doubting American EV stocks are probably the same people who didn’t believe the internet was the next big thing back in the 90’s. It’s very clear that EVs are the future, and $RIDE has a huge opportunity ahead. 🚀 🚀 🚀</p>\n\n<p><em>There is a reason the $RIDE April 23 $20 call has such high implied volatility. This is because they have a massive catalyst</em> <strong><em>THIS SATURDAY (4/17)</em></strong><em>. They signed up their truck for</em> <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/ar-BB1dWYrd\"><em>one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck</em></a> <em>– the</em> <strong><em>SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race</em></strong>*. The event will take place at Mexico&#39;s Baja California Peninsula, and it will be publicly televised.*</p>\n\n<p><em>Load the boat on shares of $RIDE and get ready to see a bunch of green in the coming weeks and months.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
