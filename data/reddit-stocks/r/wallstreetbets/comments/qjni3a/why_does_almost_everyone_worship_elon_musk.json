What does that have to do with Elon Musk in any way? I only have to make this clear because there are so many unoriginal and salty crybabies in the comments who think Elon is literally the greatest human to ever live, and that's ignorant and foolish to think he actually cares about you as anything other than a good little money generating machine...
