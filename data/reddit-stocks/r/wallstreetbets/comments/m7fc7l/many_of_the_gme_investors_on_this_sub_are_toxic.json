I’m so tired of reading through the incredible DDs in this sub only to arrive at the comment section where some smooth brained dolt wrote, “not GME, downvote” or some bullshit like that. There’s already a GME subreddit and a daily mega thread to try to keep you people from running this sub into the ground.</p>\n\n<p>So if you’re worried that your 5 shares @220 might not actually turn into 100k, make a Twitter account and start shilling GameStop there. I am aware that the GameStop play is still happening and don’t need the opinion of a 16 year old whose mommy still direct deposits money in their bank account every week. </p>\n\n<p>Let me read and plagiarize the DDs written by the real autists in peace. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: mods get that pee martini ready for me, shaken not stirred. If you disagree with me get fucked. This is my post and karma only goes up 🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: A big thank you to the mods as they have delivered the nectar of the bulls. It goes down smooth, like GME shill’s brains. Good luck to everyone with money in the market tomorrow and GME to 1,000,000🦍🦍🦍</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: I want to reiterate that I’m not all hot and bothered by the volume of GME posts. It’s the ninnies that go into posts regarding other topics and fuck about. They’re like jehovas witnesses who knock on the door of honest, hardworking, American DDs and try to convert them. In a few years they’ll teach classes about GME, but for now let me read about other autistic shit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
