THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF &#39;CONFIRMATION BIAS&#39;. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it</a>, so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this <em>light</em> weekend reading 😉</p>\n\n<p>------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 1: FINRA</strong></p>\n\n<p>I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! <a href=\"http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html\">http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html</a> (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily\">https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily</a>)</p>\n\n<p>(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day&#39;s file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)</p>\n\n<p>There was an additional <strong>22 million</strong> in short volume today, on top of the <strong>33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday</strong>. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.</p>\n\n<p>The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at <strong>57</strong>% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CAVEATS:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to <a href=\"/u/tri_fire_engineer\">u/tri_fire_engineer</a> for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that <strong>once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke</strong>t</li>\n<li><strong>daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,</strong> as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered &#39;shorting&#39; but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn&#39;t sound very fun.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assumptions used:</strong></p>\n\n<p>GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)</p>\n\n<p>GME Total Shares: 69,750,000</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aiojjnfc4xj61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23ab48804b920e09037598bbe30aa23320a77602\">https://preview.redd.it/aiojjnfc4xj61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23ab48804b920e09037598bbe30aa23320a77602</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zvoxzk2c4xj61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f883c3c654d4d66b7aa49c8f2a3bb880e7e8bf71\">https://preview.redd.it/zvoxzk2c4xj61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f883c3c654d4d66b7aa49c8f2a3bb880e7e8bf71</a></p>\n\n<p>The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at <strong>60.35%</strong> ( <a href=\"http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0\">http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0</a> ) Thanks to <a href=\"/u/wrek\">u/wrek</a> for sending this!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4ni4jdui7xj61.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb4d3129a8adff4bdedc2188d38241b3d29f2c9\">https://preview.redd.it/4ni4jdui7xj61.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb4d3129a8adff4bdedc2188d38241b3d29f2c9</a></p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2: Borrowing Shares</strong></p>\n\n<p>Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.</p>\n\n<p>The data available through iborrowdesk.com (<a href=\"https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\">https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME</a> ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site (<a href=\"https://iborrowdesk.com/about\">https://iborrowdesk.com/about</a> ).</p>\n\n<p>Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ym6xo8jb4xj61.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d69f7f809df0160a8d723d14a7be9f39006bc3\">https://preview.redd.it/ym6xo8jb4xj61.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d69f7f809df0160a8d723d14a7be9f39006bc3</a></p>\n\n<p>Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from <strong>2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate</strong>! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on <strong>Jan 27</strong> when we saw some huge intraday price swings.</p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 3: ETFs</strong></p>\n\n<p>This data of course doesn&#39;t take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, &#39;EX AR TEE&#39; is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/\">https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/</a></p>\n\n<p>Doing some quick math of ~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = ~1.1m GME shares shorted.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i7csw01b4xj61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad278b02ec5894b983ee12c62e22ee03a06eeb57\">https://preview.redd.it/i7csw01b4xj61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad278b02ec5894b983ee12c62e22ee03a06eeb57</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/\">https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/</a></p>\n\n<p>They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that&#39;s a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares). </p>\n\n<p>NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF</p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT <strong>💎🙌</strong> 💎 will prevail!!!</p>\n\n<p>Stake: shares in GME <strong>🚀</strong> <strong>🚀</strong> <strong>🚀</strong></p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p>Shoutouts to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/\">u/RicFlairsCape</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/\">u/Rrrrandle</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/\">u/CultureCrypto</a> for some good suggestions on the last post which I have incorporated.</p>\n\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p>For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled &quot;Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,&quot; which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gbp82yca4xj61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d84055dc1f1edc92e7d3be0365fb6d14de2d61\">https://preview.redd.it/gbp82yca4xj61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d84055dc1f1edc92e7d3be0365fb6d14de2d61</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
