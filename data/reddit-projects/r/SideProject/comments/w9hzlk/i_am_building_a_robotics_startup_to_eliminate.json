Taking bags of food to customers both curbside and indoors is a task that requires no skill and serious physical labor over an 8-hour shift, so replacing it with a robot is a no-brainer. I already have a customer willing to pilot it for a reduced monthly price, and a lead on another who can get us in 8 different restaurants. I am looking for a technical co-founder who can help me finish up the prototype, I am not super proficient in code for Arduino(c++) so if you are interested in working with me or just want to learn more I am happy to chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
