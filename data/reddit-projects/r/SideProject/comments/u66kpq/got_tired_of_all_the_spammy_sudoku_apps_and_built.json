I really don&amp;#39;t. A banner ad here or there is totally fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, most of the games on the app store are filled with ads to such an extent that it&amp;#39;s ridiculous. These apps are literally unusable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in February 2022, I wanted to make sudoku a daily habit and as most people would, I looked up &amp;quot;sudoku&amp;quot; on the App Store and downloaded the top result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so terrible that it blew my mind. Every few moves I had to watch a video ad. Every few MOVES not every few games. This is on top of a banner ad that&amp;#39;s constantly playing at the bottom. How are you supposed to resist the urge to chuck your phone out the window?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, as any self-respecting developer would, I built my own. It&amp;#39;s clean, ad-free and minimalistic. You can find it here: &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-evil-sudoku/id1614071642\"&gt;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-evil-sudoku/id1614071642&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any and all feedback is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
