I always enjoyed those posts nonetheless but thought it could be more seamless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also noticed on finance subreddits people passionately post pages and pages of DD (Due Diligence) on why a stock will go up or down but these are quickly forgotten about and the case is never validated. So I thought it would be good to build in daily ROI ranking from the point of fund creation for all funds on the site. I hope this brings some merit to the site as something in the media with personalities like Jim Cramer tends to be heard due to clout and not due to effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a calculator with a randomize button you can mash &lt;a href=\"https://mainst.fund/simulator\"&gt;https://mainst.fund/simulator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear any feedback and bugs you might have.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
