  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all ðŸ‘‹,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been working on my iOS (15) app Caloree for around 12 months now. I took some breaks in-between as managing work, family with kids and a side-project at the same time is not always easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But today I am pleased to announce that I am releasing a first, early beta version of Caloree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Caloree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been frustrated with existing diet trackers out there. Either they require an expensive subscription or they track you and sell your data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caloree is a simple Caloree tracker that respects your privacy (we don&amp;#39;t track you at all and never will). Also, Caloree will never be a subscription-based app. Instead Caloree will offer 2 tiers of in-app purchases:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pro: you will get access to hundreds of thousands of products, be able to scan the barcodes of these products&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ultra: you gain the ability to plan several days in advance and in the future you will get nifty features, such as image recognition, Apple Watch support, Widgets, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to expect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, this is an early build, so there will be rough spots. I am also working on additional features as I am writing this. The product catalog is still quite raw, currently lacking basic foods such as eggs and milk, which will follow in later beta versions. The weight screen still needs some love and also data entry could be better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to try out Caloree on your iPhone or know some friends who would like to try it out, feel free to install it: &lt;a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/C5Cx63Ck\"&gt;https://testflight.apple.com/join/C5Cx63Ck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be scanning this post for any questions, comments or feedback that you might have. If you would like to participate more actively you can also join the Caloree Discord server (&lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/h4XCmkPq\"&gt;https://discord.gg/h4XCmkPq&lt;/a&gt;) where I&amp;#39;ll try to be available at least once a day to discuss feature requests, learn about any issues that you found or anything else that could be useful regarding Caloree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you like this early release of Caloree. Happy testing! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rudy&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
