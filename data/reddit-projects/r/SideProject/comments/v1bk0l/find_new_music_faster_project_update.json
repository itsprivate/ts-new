Uses genre/class/valence/song/weather/chorus/bridge and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recommends new music in 10 second snippets to help you discover new music faster in a Tik Tok-like feed. Would love criticism :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also made a waitlist for it, has roughly 400 people on it so far if you&amp;#39;d like to try it out when it is out:&lt;a href=\"https://forms.gle/W7BxeY1s39andTPB7\"&gt;https://forms.gle/W7BxeY1s39andTPB7&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e262069qvo291.png?width=796&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=564299e071ba6f7bfc0cfc28268329304b6fedd2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/e262069qvo291.png?width=796&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=564299e071ba6f7bfc0cfc28268329304b6fedd2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
