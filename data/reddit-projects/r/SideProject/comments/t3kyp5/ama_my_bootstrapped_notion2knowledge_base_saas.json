With no Product Hunt launch (&lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;) and focusing solely on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sobedominik\"&gt;building in public&lt;/a&gt; and engaging with the Notion community. This is a big milestone for me and honestly, a small dream came true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some, this might be not that much but for me, it definitely is. I have already been working on several projects before HelpKit that didn&amp;#39;t even come close to this sacred MRR number. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am extremely thankful for all the folks who have supported me so far on my journey to become ramen profitable and... beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I can help you a bit on your Indiehacking journey. Perhaps I have a good answer or a mistake to share that you should totally avoid. Whatever it is, throw it at me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask me anything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is HelpKit?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, &lt;a href=\"https://www.helpkit.so/\"&gt;HelpKit&lt;/a&gt; is a no code tool that allows you to easily turn your Notion docs into a professional help center / documentation page. I started it because I was fed up with the existing knowledge base solutions and I am absolutely loving Notion.
