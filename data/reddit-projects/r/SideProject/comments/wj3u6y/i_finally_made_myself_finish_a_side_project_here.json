  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After multiple sideprojects ending up in a stale codebase, I finally made myself finish this one. A lot of my side projects are started to get familiar with certain development techniques, or implementation of packages that I might use for work. In this case, it was a combination of time/timezones (and converting between them continuously), using Livewire, automatic deployment and payment providers. At the same time I&amp;#39;ve setup a VPS (server), so this was the perfect time to get familiar with setting it up etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I created an application that revolves around calendars and events, both all-day events, or events that start and end at a given time. The challenge for myself was how to store these events, and have them shown in the correct time for other users in other timezones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can create your own calendars (for example sporting events), and add your events to them. Other users can subscribe to these calendars and have them added to their own &amp;quot;Personal Calendar&amp;quot;. This personal calendar combines all of the User&amp;#39;s calendar subscriptions into one &amp;quot;Personal Calendar&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Users can add their Personal Calendar to their device (using the ical-standard), but also single calendars they subscribed to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All calendars are also viewable on the platform itself, if you have no device to add it to (or you just don&amp;#39;t want to).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent myself from putting this on the shelf again, I decided to do a sort-of &amp;quot;soft launch&amp;quot;. The application is fully operational, and accessible for everyone. I&amp;#39;ve added about 75 calendars, with over 4500 events to start with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More features will follow, but for now the main focus lies with performance updates and bugfixes. If you have any ideas, suggestions or comments, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/szw57l6pdgg91.png?width=1762&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=28a1f2e34d9998fba14b4601defe725005b0d951\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/szw57l6pdgg91.png?width=1762&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=28a1f2e34d9998fba14b4601defe725005b0d951&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
