We observe the crisis with dread, watching friends and relatives under attack. We need to get active.&lt;br/&gt;\nTherefore we decided to contribute with our small freelancing platform - &lt;a href=\"https://ramen.network\"&gt;ramen.network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe will help regular people like Lisa&amp;#39;s relatives - lucky to be alive, but lost their jobs and are isolated from the world.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe will use our platform ramen and try to get as many Ukrainians jobs through this as possible with our small team and currently manual operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can you help?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you know Ukrainians in need for a remote job, send their profiles. Our small team will try to find remote work for them as fast as possible in our network.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Or if you are a developer, you can help us automate this process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;#39;t charge any user on this marketplace until foreseeable future. Our mission: Get Ukrainians back into jobs to feed their families fast and without bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Want to contribute?
