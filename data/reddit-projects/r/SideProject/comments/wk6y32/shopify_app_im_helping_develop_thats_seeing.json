It gets applied at checkout and the customer can toggle it off or on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve tested it in a few beta stores already and it&amp;#39;s led to higher order values without a drop in conversion (in fact it&amp;#39;s increased if anything).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue is that installation has to be manual since it varies from theme to theme.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re giving out free trials and will walk you through every step of install. I&amp;#39;d love for more people to try it out!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested, feel free to book time directly with our devs/team at &lt;a href=\"https://www.shipsafecommerce.com/\"&gt;https://www.shipsafecommerce.com&lt;/a&gt; (rather than install through the App Store)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
