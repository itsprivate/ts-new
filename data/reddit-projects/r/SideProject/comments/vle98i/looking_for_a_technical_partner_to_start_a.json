Through a multi-disciplinary and fearless approach, attention to detail and the highest level of creative, I breathe new life into brands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This mindset has enabled me to work effortlessly across disciplines and build an eclectic body of work for some of the greatest brands and companies on planet earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dream is to start a full-service agency that offers an innovative approach to strategy, experience, engineering and marketing. The agency will be different because we take a holistic view of our clients’ businesses, and we work with them to create custom solutions that achieve their specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a customer base, a businessplan and businessmodel ready. Furthermore I have a network of professionals who can help us with the start-up, which I am glad to share with you in a detailed conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking for a full-stack developer who will be my equal partner in the agency. You will handle the technical part, I will handle the creative and business part. If you have the same drive, energy and inquisitiveness as me to build this company up from scratch and be successful, please send me a message and we can discuss this in further detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your location is not important me, as we can work remote. I do want to have frequent (video) calls to discuss projects and the business in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
