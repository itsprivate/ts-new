I have tried many solutions, but struggled to find an app that had built-in data visualization on par with what I could do using my laptop – so I made one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pivot is an app designed for manual tracking without the hassle. You can quickly switch between your activities and easily backfill time entries if you miss something. Dynamically updated and customizable charts allow you to effectively review your entries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time tracking is great if you want to change your habits. With Pivot, you can set goals against your timers, making it easier to take action. More features will be coming out soon, including notifications and widgets!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The app is available on Android and currently in open beta, with an official release in a couple of weeks! You can try it out here: &lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pivot.android\"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pivot.android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would be very interested to hear your feedback or suggestions. I’d also be happy to answer any questions about Pivot or the development process. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
