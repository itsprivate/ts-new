  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;about a year ago during my 1:1 my boss told me that my face is barely visible because of the window in the background and that I should do something about it. Obviously I bough some apps in the Mac App Store - but all of them were not supporting my web camera. As an engineering manager and ex iOS software engineer I decided that I have to fix it and I&amp;#39;ve build the new Mac app that would support most of the web cameras because of it&amp;#39;s primitive functionality and that&amp;#39;s how &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/exposure-adjustor/id1570960511?mt=12\"&gt;Exposure Adjustor&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the idea is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7fq9xclzw8c81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=79df6dfa753ca1974a9377e46e33fdce149d3fee\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7fq9xclzw8c81.png?width=2880&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=79df6dfa753ca1974a9377e46e33fdce149d3fee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cover (with your hand) the part of your camera(lens) that is exposed to too much light&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Press Lock button to &amp;quot;lock&amp;quot; the current exposure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Till now I haven&amp;#39;t advertise my app in any way and those are the stats: (I released 7 months ago)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sales: 98.94$&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proceeds: 76.83$&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Units: 44\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Europe - 19&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;USA &amp;amp; Canada - 17&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Asia Pacific - 6&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Latin America &amp;amp; The Caribbean - 2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rating: 5.0 (3 reviews ðŸ˜‚)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the first app I&amp;#39;ve done and published for myself and not for the company or a client. Every sale is surprisingly satisfying and makes me really happy that someone is able to use it and is happy with what they&amp;#39;ve bought - I got 2 emails saying that it&amp;#39;s a very cool app as it does exactly what it says on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
