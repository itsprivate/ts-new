I had been sending sponsored and affiliate emails to our user base before I didn&amp;#39;t have time to anymore. Similar tools in local have gotten ~$3 million to $30 million in venture capital, but that&amp;#39;s not a space I&amp;#39;m very fluent in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the value comes from the community and cheap, effective funnel - if you&amp;#39;re working in a consumer-facing startup you know that people are burning cash to get these users at $45-$125 per user account.
