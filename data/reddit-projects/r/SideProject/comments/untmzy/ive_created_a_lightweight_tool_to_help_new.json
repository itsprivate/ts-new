I often see bias, constraint, and ego get in the way while awesome choices get buried... I&amp;#39;ve been on both ends of this story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to build a tool to help new leaders and managers in highly collaborative environments discover better decisions. So I built Sparel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/wom2ua3pazy81.gif\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/wom2ua3pazy81.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works by lightly structuring your questions, hypotheses and experiments, and then it provides you with insights on any biases that it can find. You can also have Sparel generate ideas if you&amp;#39;re blocked - it uses AI, Twitter, and Google Books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how many of you are in leadership roles but I would love to know what Sparel needs to help you make decisions. You can sign up for free at &lt;a href=\"https://sparel.app\"&gt;https://sparel.app&lt;/a&gt; - please give it a shot, would love to hear back üôè&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
