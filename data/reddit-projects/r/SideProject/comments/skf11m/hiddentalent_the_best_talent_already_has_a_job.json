I realized it was way easier to look for a new job when you have already quit because you can just post on LinkedIn/ Twitter / etc... that you are looking. But if you haven&amp;#39;t quit your only option is to search for jobs yourself and try to find something. However, there might be a lot of jobs not posted or you might not see them. So this allows you to passively look for a new job without fear of your current employer finding out. So when you put in all your data it generates an anonymized profile that recruiters can search for. If they think you fit what they are looking for they can request access to your private info and upon your approval see your real data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feedback is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
