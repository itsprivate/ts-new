It leans a bit towards genres where artists frequently appear with other artists like rap/hip hop, but I try to pick the better known ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have fun :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://featurle.com\"&gt;https://featurle.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/96rnpl4hx8091.png?width=840&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2034dc03d62a7343e57503df68da87a6a0aa0c57\"&gt;Featurle in light mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
