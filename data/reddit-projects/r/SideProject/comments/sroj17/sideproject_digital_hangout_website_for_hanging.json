It also features playlist option where we can like our favorite youtube videos to create a playlist. The rooms give you privacy by choosing it to be private. Also option of clearing chat, etc. When registered, it allows to send and receive friend requests and private dms. Also, it allows to play games together, draw together. It features inbuilt search section for youtube videos, so you don&amp;#39;t need to copy links and paste it, you can search any youtube video in the app itself. Also there is a movies section, where you can literally watch any movie or show for free, simply by searching in search box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been passionately working on it, and daily trying to improve it. I would like you guys to check it out, and give feedback on it. What else I can add to it. How can I make it better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, join its discord please, &lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/rXU9DVDsFf\"&gt;https://discord.gg/rXU9DVDsFf&lt;/a&gt; so that you guys can give feedback on new features and updates I do in future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
