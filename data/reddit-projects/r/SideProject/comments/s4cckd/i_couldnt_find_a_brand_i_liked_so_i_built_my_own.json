  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to post my story here, in that hopes that at least one of you reading this will also be inspired to take the leap and launch your own startup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a guy, for a long time I&amp;#39;ve been pretty frustrated that when it comes to buying a notebook or journal. It just feels so unnecessarily limited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a shopper (and especially a male shopper) you&amp;#39;re forced to choose between the following options:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stacked high, sold cheap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe first is some low quality, generic and unremarkable brand with the lowest price point. Those are the spiral bound notepads you find lingering in stationary cupboards in offices around the country. Thin scratchy paper, made it bulk and cheap as chips&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Colours gone wild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe second is a deluge of notebooks covered in cliched one liners, trending hashtags, glittery slogans and fluffy taglines. It’s often set against a backdrop of garish colours, soft pastels and faded hues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Flowers, flowers &amp;amp; more flowers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe third is a trend you’re most likely to see in stores. Waves of floral illustrations and topped off with that generic handwriting font to give it that vague waft of authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Boring for the Boardroom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe fourth is reserved for that range of expensive corporate stationery that is bereft of character or charm. Designed entirely for boardroom meetings and destined to remain unopened on desks worldwide. Cheap leather covers, faux gold clasps holding it all together and pages filled with different timezones that you never reference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nWhere are the high quality notebooks for people who don’t want a hashtag on their cover, a bulky office book or a jungle themed journal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find one. So I decided to create it. Say hello to &lt;a href=\"http://www.phantomnotes.com/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phantom Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/@alexwain/love-stationery-you-deserve-better-say-hello-to-phantom-63e68fa7776a\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;story behind it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the few months since launch I&amp;#39;ve had customers from Australia, United States, Dubai, Belgium and New Zealand. And it&amp;#39;s all run out of my garage - literally!   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I&amp;#39;m posting here because I&amp;#39;d love some feedback from this amazing community. What do you think I could do better? How could I push that needle further and potentially take it from a passion project to a full time brand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realise that Reddit is a two way street! So I&amp;#39;m really happy to help answer any questions you have and to give you shortcuts if you need. I launched a pretty successful startup &lt;a href=\"http://www.sobadsogood.com\"&gt;many moons ago&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I will say this, whatever your idea or startup is, do it because you enjoy it - not because you want to be the next Bezos or dominate the world. When you find something you love, it easy to be motivated do it everyday without fail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
