  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyoneðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹, my name is Angel and I am working on a project helping remote workers! It&amp;#39;s a plain old remote job board, but it&amp;#39;s probably the most complete and well-updated one out there (at least I haven&amp;#39;t found others like it). It&amp;#39;s basically a remote-exclusive job aggregator, sourcing data from 17 different places.&lt;br/&gt;\nEverything is checked and all data-discrepancies are filled manually by me (for now). So if you are only looking for remote frontend jobs with salaries, this is the place to go because I am trying to extract that information from each offer and classify it so it&amp;#39;s easily visible in the job description :)&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also just had my first paying customer and you can see their advertisement featured on top of the front-end list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCompany Name: Remote Frontend Jobs / Remote Backend Jobs&lt;br/&gt;\nURL: &lt;a href=\"https://remotefrontendjobs.com/\"&gt;https://remotefrontendjobs.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://remotebackendjobs.com/\"&gt;https://remotebackendjobs.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nPurpose of Startup and Product: Main idea behind the project is being able to quickly find thousands of remote jobs, aggregated from many different job sources, pre-focused on specific technology. For now it&amp;#39;s just frontend and backend, but we will probably introduce more in the future.&lt;br/&gt;\nTechnologies Used: Next.js (web app, lambdas), NestJS (cron jobs and email service), Prisma (ORM), MySql (database), Vercel (hosting)&lt;br/&gt;\nFeedback Requested: I&amp;#39; love literally any kind of feedback. I am doing everything on my own so UX, frontend, backend, marketing or even conceptual feedback on the idea would give me a lot of information right now!&lt;br/&gt;\nSeeking Beta-Testers: yes&lt;br/&gt;\nAdditional Comments: &lt;strong&gt;This project is only a couple of months old and is under active development, so expect updates :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
