The reason is that I don’t want to sacrifice my data and store it on a commercial service. Yet, there’re some apps that claim to be respecting privacy, but many don’t support iCloud Sync at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus the app, “Me”, was created. So far, it supports basic location track with almost no extra battery cost in the background, and integrations with HealthKit on your iPhone to record activity data (such as sleep, steps, commute etc.). Last but not the least, it supports iCloud Sync out of the box for free, without compromise for our data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTW, it’s mostly written in SwiftUI! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can visit &lt;a href=\"https://thespecial.me\"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/me-personal-life-tracker/id1587707078\"&gt;App Store page&lt;/a&gt; for more introduction or download.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know how do you think about it. This is just a start, and I’m open to feedback and make it better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
