There&amp;#39;re no paywalls, no subscriptions, it&amp;#39;s just a website that I plan to publish free templates on (whenever I find time to create them) &amp;amp; improve my Tailwind CSS skills as I go along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can access the templates at &lt;a href=\"https://htmlwow.com\"&gt;https://htmlwow.com&lt;/a&gt;. I would love to hear your feedback on the templates &amp;amp; suggestions on what types of templates to build next âœ¨&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: All templates are optimized &amp;amp; ready to deploy w/ overall 95+ Lighthouse scores. I hope it&amp;#39;s useful to someone, either as a learning resource or as a product to do your job faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking ðŸš€&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
