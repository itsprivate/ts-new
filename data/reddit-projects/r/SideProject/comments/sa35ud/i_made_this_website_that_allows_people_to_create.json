If you workout at home, create a timer and you don&amp;#39;t have to look at the screen or calculate the time in your head anymore :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think it can be better if I can make a mobile app on this, but I don&amp;#39;t have enough knowledge and devices to do it. So, if you want to have a &amp;quot;mobile version&amp;quot;, the best way now is to record the screen and export as mp3 file and save to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope it&amp;#39;s helpful for you :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://timermaker.com\"&gt;https://timermaker.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
