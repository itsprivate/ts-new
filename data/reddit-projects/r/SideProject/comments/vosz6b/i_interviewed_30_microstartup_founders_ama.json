I covered these four questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- How did you come up with the microstartup idea?&lt;br/&gt;\n- How did you find your first customers?&lt;br/&gt;\n- How are you finding your customers today?&lt;br/&gt;\n- What&amp;#39;s your advice for other microfounders who want to get started?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re planning to start your own microstartup and you have any questions, I&amp;#39;m happy to answer based on what I&amp;#39;ve learned from these founders!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS. I put together a quick ebook with some of the main answers: &lt;a href=\"https://microfounder.com/solo-developer-startup\"&gt;https://microfounder.com/solo-developer-startup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
