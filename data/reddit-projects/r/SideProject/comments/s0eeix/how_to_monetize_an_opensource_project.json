Worked on it almost for almost a year after my 9-to-5 job and even on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn more about this project here: &lt;a href=\"https://ownstore.dev/\"&gt;https://ownstore.dev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This project wasn&amp;#39;t a success IMHO. But I knew 1 thing: the quality of code I had used to develop was beyond industry standards. I&amp;#39;m still really of its scalable and maintainable architecture. Code is the true USP here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People didn&amp;#39;t show much interest when this was a paid product, but surprisingly all this changed as soon as I open-sourced it. Maybe not the product but the code had an impact here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of the effort I had put in for this project, I might lose my full time here. So I&amp;#39;m trying to find out a way to monetize this project or get any good opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br/&gt;\nFaiyaz&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
