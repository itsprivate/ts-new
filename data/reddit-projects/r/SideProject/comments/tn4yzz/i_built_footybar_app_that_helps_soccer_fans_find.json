So I hired overseas developers to build a simple app called &lt;a href=\"https://footybar.app\"&gt;Footybar&lt;/a&gt; that would show soccer bars based on your location, and users would be able to review them and also suggest new bars. I would love constructive criticism and feedback, so I can add new useful features. It&amp;#39;s far from being a perfect/complete data, but the app would show more accurate information with more user input. Check it out and review some bars on the app if you&amp;#39;re a soccer fan!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
