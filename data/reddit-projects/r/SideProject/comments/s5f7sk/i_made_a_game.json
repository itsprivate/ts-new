It&amp;#39;s called The Running Knight, and it&amp;#39;s a puzzle game with over 50 levels to solve. The goal of the game is to help a knight pass all the obstacles he might come across in the dungeons. There is a catch! The knight can&amp;#39;t stop moving, so you have to help him avoid obstacles, and build pathways for him to find the exit safely. It&amp;#39;s available both on Android and iOS. Hope you&amp;#39;ll enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Link here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.tofanitty.com\"&gt;https://www.tofanitty.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
