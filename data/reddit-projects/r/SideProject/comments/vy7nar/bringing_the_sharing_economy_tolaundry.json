Our idea is to allow folks to rent a neighbor’s washing machine, or hire one of the nearby “Laundry Hosts” for wash &amp;amp; fold service. We’re aiming to offer a more convenient alternative to the laundromat, which can sometimes be far or unpleasant, and be more affordable than other wash &amp;amp; fold or pick up and delivery services. Particularly in cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, etc. there are a lot of people who don’t have in-unit laundry, or even in-building laundry, and we’re keen to give them a new option to get their laundry done. There could be some pretty neat environmental benefits too.
