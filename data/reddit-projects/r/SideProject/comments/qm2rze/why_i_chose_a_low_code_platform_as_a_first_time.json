A few days ago, I finally arrived at my first serious product launch, <a href=\"https://codingfont.com/\">Coding Font</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The project got a lot of press, and many people were curious about it. I thought I could share a bit of my building process here, especially why I decided to use a Low Code tool if anyone is interested.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>\n\n<p>Coding Font is a font selection and preview tool. It helps you find a coding font through a tournament-style gamified experience. As devs, we spend a lot of time in front of our computer screens coding. The coding font that we spend 8 hours a day staring at has a lot to do with our productivity and comfort. I am very picky about coding fonts and always trying to find optimal settings. So I thought, why not create a fun, gamified experience that helps you find your true love of coding fonts? And viola, Coding Font is born.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Low Code</strong></p>\n\n<p>Coding Font is created using Low Code. After using Low Code tools to create internal font management tools for my startup, Typogram, I decided on this route. It was so easy and powerful to set it up and get it running that we were itch to use it for another project.</p>\n\n<p>I also notice that many apps made with No Code / Low Code are libraries of pre-existing informational or functional things. These libraries are perfect for No Code / Low Code implementations because an API can power them. The interaction layer is also standard with minimal customization needs. The intrinsic value of these apps came from the content or data itself. For us, this library of functional things is coding fonts. Our idea is perfect for LowCode execution.</p>\n\n<p>So there you have it, that&#39;s why I decided on Low Code for Coding Font. I tried it for this project, and I think I had tons of fun using it. I am also seeing a new generation of platforms arriving that are open-minded and open-ended. They offer freedom to go off the road by systematically allowing users to write custom code and components. I am looking forward to witnessing where Low Code takes us next.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you want to check out the original post, it is <a href=\"https://wentin.substack.com/p/create-a-coding-font-game-with-low\">here.</a> There are a lot more technical details there with code snippets.
