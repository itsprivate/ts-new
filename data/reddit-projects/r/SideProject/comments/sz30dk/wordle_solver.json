So I understand a trie essentially has 26 initial children nodes and each child node has another possible 26 and so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a trie it would be simple if the users guess has a green letter as the first letter, but what about when it’s say in the middle? How would I go backwards? As in say my guess was “HANDS” and the only correct letter was N. How would I have my trie narrow down the words that have an N at index 2?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No need for code please just conceptual as I want to figure it out code wise. Thank you!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
