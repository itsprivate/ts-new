  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, during the first part of the pandemic, I realized I was buying way too much online on impulse. I started reading about all the psychological and neurological tricks and &amp;quot;hacks&amp;quot; that online sellers use to get people to buy. All the terminology really turned me off--seeing people as &amp;quot;clicks&amp;quot; to get into &amp;quot;frictionless sales funnels&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; into sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I made a Chrome extension that I hoped would help me realize what was happening. Basically, it detects when I&amp;#39;m on a website that&amp;#39;s selling me something, and it shows me a message about marketing hacks or with some kind of motivation. There are two buttons--one for if I planned to be at the website (which makes the popup disappear), and another if I didn&amp;#39;t mean to be at another shopping website. If I click the second button, the extension takes me somewhere interesting, where I&amp;#39;m not spending money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found it actually worked for me, so I&amp;#39;m starting to share Spend Less with the world. It&amp;#39;s 100% free. No ads (obviously that would defeat the purpose). Doesn&amp;#39;t ask for any information and track anything. Honestly just something I thought I could make that could help real people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spend-less/lmbgmiblmhdkpalcecdidbhfidkgbcmp\"&gt;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spend-less/lmbgmiblmhdkpalcecdidbhfidkgbcmp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
