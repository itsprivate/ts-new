Recently, however, I&amp;#39;ve started to grow in my Christian faith, and I thought it&amp;#39;d be a good idea to create a project that would help others who are in a similar position (or who are interested in Christianity). You can find it here: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://beginnerchristian.net\"&gt;https://beginnerchristian.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The website isn&amp;#39;t anything crazy - it&amp;#39;s a collection of articles and products I&amp;#39;ve curated that I think will help new folks understand the basic concepts better. I&amp;#39;m using Amazon Affiliate links for each product as well, and I&amp;#39;m going to donate all the money generated through those to charity (you can check out the charities on the Charities page). The site also has a short checklist of tasks user can complete to help lead them in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I&amp;#39;m pretty new to launching and optimizing sites, so I&amp;#39;d love any feedback! Thanks for taking the time to check it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4fb38qqgczr81.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=74432c5bbb636a47c440de03206c19fcddedb36a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4fb38qqgczr81.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=74432c5bbb636a47c440de03206c19fcddedb36a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
