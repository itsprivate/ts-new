It&amp;#39;s a web app that has icon designs from Microsoft&amp;#39;s fluent icons and makes them easily acceessible to download in any color and any format (SVG, PNG, JPG). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s called Fluenticons.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has good traffic and lots of returning users, but no revenue.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ideas for new features are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;\n- add more icons to download&lt;br/&gt;\n- all users to add gradient color to icons&lt;br/&gt;\n- allow users to add app backgrounds to icons (app icon generator)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To access these new features I was thinking I would require the user to register, but not pay anything.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue generator would be:&lt;br/&gt;\n- adding new &amp;quot;premium&amp;#39; icon sets - monthly fee or one-time.&lt;br/&gt;\n- ads  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think? I&amp;#39;m open to ideas for gaining new users/revenue, or anything really! This is my first acquisition and i&amp;#39;m excited to scale it up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My expertise is marketing, so all of the technical works needs to be outsourced, but the platform is built in React and it seems easy enough to find good talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
