At the time it had 31 users&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now at 724&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stridist is an online coaching software for training and nutrition professionals who love their clients&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Client programming, communication and tracking in one easy to use platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Started by spending 4 months on dev. I have an existing audience of potential users &amp;amp; knew the upfront development was needed to make it a viable choice for them&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During dev we built a priority list &amp;amp; used genuine scarcity and urgency to grow it to around 1,400&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost all priority list users came from my existing email list and my Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once launched. We used Rewardful and gave users first access to our generous referral programme of 20% of lifetime monthlies for anyone they refer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More urgency used. “Get your referrals in before we roll this out to our partners”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ve had ~130 referrals so far&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our next growth “project” is takeover weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Experts in the industry are delivering 1 week intensives to our users. Mini courses essentially&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re co-promoting them, delivering amazing value to our users through the intensives, and helping experts reach more people&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re going to begin cold outreach soon too&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I created a Twitter thread that I&amp;#39;ll keep updating as we continue on this journey!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find it here: &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/SukhSidhuUK/status/1520707364839735297?s=20&amp;amp;t=SdC9hnJZiMT908w5NmFESw\"&gt;https://twitter.com/SukhSidhuUK/status/1520707364839735297?s=20&amp;amp;t=SdC9hnJZiMT908w5NmFESw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
