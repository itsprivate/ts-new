Users receive affordable, valuable advice/feedback while experts finally get a way to fit paid teaching/guidance into their busy schedules. An expert could be anyone: heroes, celebrities, academic pioneers, and most importantly, you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More details&lt;/strong&gt;: Mobile app that emphasizes bite-sized submissions for affordable expert feedback. Experts are defined as anyone who believes they have experience that people would pay for, or have a community/fan base that loves them enough to pay for their response (and if you don’t fit that bill, you can offer free advice and build that experience/credibility up!). People looking for advice can only submit bite-sized text or video submissions, so they won’t be paying a lot in comparison to other expert feedback platforms. Any unread submissions after a week results in the hold being taken off the user&amp;#39;s account or the submission being transferred to a different expert if wanted. Experts look through the super short submissions in a fun TikTok style format (which works because all submissions are short), which makes it fun to interact with fans, teach others, and give guidance for extra money (or for charity donations if they’d like) on their free time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What life cycle stage is your startup at?&lt;/strong&gt; Discovery&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your role?&lt;/strong&gt; Solo founder and Software Developer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What goals are you trying to reach this month?&lt;/strong&gt; Prepare my startup for my university&amp;#39;s startup competition! Interview as many people as I can and validate my idea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How could &lt;a href=\"/r/SideProject\"&gt;r/SideProject&lt;/a&gt; help?&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;d mean the WORLD to me if you checked out the site, gave feedback, and join the mailing list. Like a part of me is so scared because I&amp;#39;ve never done a startup before, but this idea is something I&amp;#39;m so driven to make a reality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone! Again, join me at &lt;a href=\"https://rayzor.io\"&gt;https://rayzor.io&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
