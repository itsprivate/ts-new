I have to say, the process gets old really quick, especially in recent years. Booting up a fresh react project, integrating it with state management and UI libraries du-jour, rinse and repeat for backend and then endless AWS back-and-forth for hosting the damn thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know, there&amp;#39;s a ton of boilerplate solutions out there, but generally the seem to fall into two categories - completely unmantained or missing a specific piece.Hence, I&amp;#39;ve started working on Niles, a set of best-practice templates for a typical fullstack web development project that handles everything required from front-end to hosting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Been working on this for a while together with my co-founders but I find myself at a point where we could use some feedback from you guys - do you feel the same pains when booting up a new project? Would you subscribe to Niles and just KNOW you can rely on the latest sets of dependencies working nicely together? Especially interested if you&amp;#39;re involved in similar work (freelancing on some variation of React-based JS stacks).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check it out here: &lt;a href=\"https://niles.telepat.io\"&gt;niles.telepat.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
