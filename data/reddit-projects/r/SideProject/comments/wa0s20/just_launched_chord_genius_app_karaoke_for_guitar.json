Use Spotify, YouTube, or Apple Music to stream music and have it automagically synced up with the chords and lyrics on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/xdmiu16rs8e91.gif\"&gt;Chord Genius in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve had some hurdles along the way, but after years of hard work we are finally able to launch the app and bring it to market. We&amp;#39;ve acquired a license for songs from Warner Chappell Music, and right now the current catalog of songs isn&amp;#39;t large, but it includes some of their popular songs (Green Day, Paramore, Twenty One Pilots, Simple Plan, Nickelback, etc). One thing to note though, the license doesn&amp;#39;t cover the Europe territory, so we&amp;#39;re unable to launch in that region for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visit our launch page and support us on &lt;a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/chord-genius\"&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll find some promo codes there too ðŸ‘€ A feedback on the post would be much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or else, just download the app right away:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;iOS: &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chord-genius/id1625337241\"&gt;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chord-genius/id1625337241&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Android: &lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.chordgenius\"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.chordgenius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
