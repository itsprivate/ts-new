I am just a developer and trying to do something make life easier. Anyway, my website is a cv generator. You can add generate and use 7 different cv templates and color varieties. You can share your cv with your username easily like &lt;a href=\"https://www.untitledcv.com/kaylewinter\"&gt;www.untitledcv.com/kaylewinter&lt;/a&gt; . If you need a free cv template and don&amp;#39;t want to cop with syntax in word or other editors, you can try it. Thanks. Also I am waiting your suggestions to make it better. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
