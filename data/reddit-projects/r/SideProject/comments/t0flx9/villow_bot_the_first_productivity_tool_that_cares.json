  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ever struggled with procrastination, you probably realised that in most of the cases you procrastinated not because you didn&amp;#39;t know how to organise your to-do list or because you&amp;#39;re lazy, but because deep down you were struggling with certain emotions or thoughts that made it impossible for you to do anything. A lot of the time it&amp;#39;s very hard to understand those sabotaging emotions, but most importantly it&amp;#39;s extremely hard to know how to help yourself get unstuck and move on with your work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Together with my friend, we created a tool that does exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Villow bot helps anyone struggling to be productive &lt;strong&gt;understand the real reasons behind their productivity struggles&lt;/strong&gt; (like fear of failure, lack of motivation, etc) and offers simple exercises to help you feel better in the moment and build healthy routines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can try it for free here: &lt;a href=\"https://t.me/villow_labs_bot\"&gt;https://t.me/villow_labs_bot&lt;/a&gt; (you will need a Telegram app which is totally free too)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is our very first version of the tool, and we would appreciate your feedback to help us make Villow bot as helpful to everyone as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re welcome to leave your feedback here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Villow/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Villow/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
