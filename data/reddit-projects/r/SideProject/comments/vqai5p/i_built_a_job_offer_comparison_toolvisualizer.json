  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a new grad and recently was recently comparing job offers out of college. I had offers from different companies in different locations and wanted an easy, visual way of comparing offers adjusted by taxes and cost of living. So, I made &lt;a href=\"https://budget-estimator.vercel.app/\"&gt;https://budget-estimator.vercel.app/&lt;/a&gt; to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just fill the form with company name (which just acts as the label), location, and income (split into salary, bonus, stocks). Click &amp;quot;add estimation&amp;quot; and the offer/budget estimate will be added to the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/94e952wsga991.png?width=1835&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=15d89388713b6c4a77d1168d28b6d7133c1bb594\"&gt;Two offers compared with budget estimator. Expenses (taxes and rent) are to the left and net income is to the right, to make it really easy to compare.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attached is an example with identical offers (100k salary, 10k bonus) in Seattle and San Francisco being compared. You can hover over each category to see what it is (type of expense/net income and amount). Currently, the estimate only factors in taxes (which can differ based on income type, like how bonuses are taxed differently than salary, and how stocks are counted as salary) and rent based on &lt;a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html\"&gt;https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m hoping to add optional estimates like average cost of utilities, groceries, and gas to make the comparison even more detailed. And beyond comparing offers, I hope it can become a budgeting visualizer or just a way for people to see how much moving could benefit them, if applicable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tech stack is NextJS with D3 for visualization (my first D3 project, so it&amp;#39;s not too elegant - I&amp;#39;m hoping to add a sankey visualization form in the future). Open to any suggestions, and hope to make it open source once I clean things up and appreciate any help/feedback!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
