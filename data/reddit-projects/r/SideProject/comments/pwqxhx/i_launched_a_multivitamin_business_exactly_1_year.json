In a global pandemic, starting a multivitamin company was the obvious natural move for me...</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve learnt a heck of a lot over the past 12 months, so I thought I&#39;d share some of my learnings, and hopefully it can help someone on their journey.</p>\n\n<p>Here goes...</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Word of Mouth is the goal</strong></p>\n\n<p>When people receive your product, they need to be &#39;wowed&#39;. This could be due to the packaging, speed of delivery, the product itself. But it needs to make an impact.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re successful at this, then these people will tell their friends - this is easily the best marketing you can get. Wow your customer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Shipping</strong></p>\n\n<p>I spent the first 3 months packaging all of the orders myself, whilst working fulltime for a bank. It was exhausting, and more importantly, ate up all my free time in the evenings.</p>\n\n<p>I was spending hours packaging orders when I could have been doing more valuable things like marketing. </p>\n\n<p>Outsource your shipping as soon as it becomes viable, you won&#39;t regret it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Don&#39;t Be Afraid To Ask For Help</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I launched, I messaged 500 of my Facebook friends letting them know. About 10 bought! Not amazing returns, but not awful!</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll be shocked how willing your friends are to help you, but don&#39;t be afraid to ask!</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Brand Partnerships</strong></p>\n\n<p>Growing can be really difficult as a start up, especially if you&#39;re budget is tight. </p>\n\n<p>We found partnering up with 1 or 2 brands who could stock our product on their website to be super effective. It gave us 2 new audiences with customers willing to buy. On those days where your Shopify store does 10 views, it feels great to have some sales come in from your partnerships.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Pay The Money</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re a new founder, chances are you&#39;ve been scouring Fiverr trying to find someone to create your logo. Heck, I did. £10 for someone to make it, awesome.</p>\n\n<p>However, a few months later, after building some knowledge in the industry, I realised our logo sucked.</p>\n\n<p>It really made that saying hit home, &quot;buy cheap by twice&quot;. Luckily, we didn&#39;t make that mistake with our website hosting platform. Shopify is worth every bit of the monthly fee, highly recommend to those considering!</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Repeat Purchases</strong></p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t know how important these were until about month 6. Turns out, it&#39;s a lot cheaper to retain existing customers than it is finding new ones.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if customers are repeatedly buying your product, it shows good product market fit. The holy grail - a space in the industry where your product meets the needs of your user. </p>\n\n<p>Find ways to incentivise repeat purchases, whether that&#39;s a slick email campaign, or a valuable subscription offer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s it, 6 things I&#39;ve learnt on this founder journey of mine. Hopefully it was able to help someone out their take the next step in their own journey.</p>\n\n<p>Peace,</p>\n\n<p>Josh</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
