The most complete free self-study design course. I hope you enjoy it and get the most out of it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Link to the UX Database product design course: &lt;a href=\"https://www.uxdatabase.io/free-product-design-course\"&gt;https://www.uxdatabase.io/free-product-design-course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(If you want to collaborate upvoting it on Product Hunt, that would be awesome! &lt;a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ux-database-2\"&gt;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ux-database-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any feedback you can give me will be more than welcome!!! Thank you very much ðŸ¥°&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
