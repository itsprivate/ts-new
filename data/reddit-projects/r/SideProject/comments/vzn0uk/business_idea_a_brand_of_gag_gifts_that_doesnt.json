  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! Every week I post a few business ideas on here for you all to chat about. If you’d like to see our archive of past ideas at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate gag gifts. But not because I don’t like the idea of them. I hate them because they always boil down to “Oh wow, you got me garbage! Ha ha how funny.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All gag gifts that I’ve ever seen were both:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not good as pranks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not good as gifts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The “gag” of the gift is almost always just that the recipient expected a gift and got trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Idea&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea is super simple: A site / brand that sells gag gifts that are both:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moderately functional / useful&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Actually funny&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you accomplish that. It’s a super simple formula.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You sell normal commodity products that everyone uses. Trash cans, toasters, speakers, coffee makers, etc. Things that the person could actually use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, you create some mechanic inside of these products that slowly and subtly (over months of use) changes their behavior to make the people feel like they’re going crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You buy someone a gag trash can. At the start it’s totally normal. Maybe the hinge squeaks a little bit. Slowly, over 1-2 months, the squeak gets fairly loud. By month 3 the trash can is fully moaning every time someone opens / closes it. Go to your friend’s house and watch their descent into madness as their trash can screams at the top of its lungs every time it opens. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You buy them a toaster. Over the first 1-2 months, it seems normal. There’s a bit of a weird toasting pattern on one side but whatever. After 2-3 months, someone in their family notices that the pattern looks kind of like Jesus. Maybe they contact the news or try to sell it for $1000 on Facebook marketplace. Then by month 6 it is a totally clear picture of Jesus on their toast.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You get them a nice bluetooth speaker. Every week it increases the pitch of the song by just a hair. By the 3 month mark everything they listen to sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s the idea. Just gifts that are normal and somewhat useful, but subtly drives the person crazy over time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Would you buy something like that for your friends? Let me know in the comments! Also, if you want to see our backlog of ideas you can do that at landing.dailyidea.com&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
