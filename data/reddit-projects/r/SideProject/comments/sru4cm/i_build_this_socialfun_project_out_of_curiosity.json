Kind of nervous :)&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;m junior frontend dev and I thought I make this side project for fun/curiosity , so the idea is very simple,  I want to make stickers with a sentence &amp;quot;How do you feel?&amp;quot; and add a qr code to it, so people can go there and write anonymously how they feel, to let it out, sometimes it makes you feel better.

What do you think? suggestions are welcome! thank you and have a great day :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://howdoyoufeel-16806.web.app/\"&gt;https://howdoyoufeel-16806.web.app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
