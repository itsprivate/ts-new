(http://recruiters.wtf)&lt;/a&gt;, a thing to help you filter them out. When you go there you chose how the filter should work:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/057svnx247791.jpg?width=1038&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fb6fd8a0e58a10ed7fd14834c039e638d7c49b62\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/057svnx247791.jpg?width=1038&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fb6fd8a0e58a10ed7fd14834c039e638d7c49b62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hit &amp;quot;Create Filter&amp;quot; and you&amp;#39;ll download it to your computer. Then you just need to import it into GMail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of bad recruiters just pop your email in a mailing list and send you all sorts of irrelevant job positions. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s pretty much spam, like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b0xl8j3p17791.jpg?width=1198&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51807b8f3a3b68c3619b3b7c8176b8ec96f60263\"&gt;J is not even my name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but if you mark them as spam, when you actually want to talk to recruiters, you&amp;#39;ll have to go to the spam folder and find those emails among a lot of pure garbage. Also, you&amp;#39;ll teach your spam filter to filter out keywords you care about. It&amp;#39;s a mess (ask me how I know ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I created &lt;a href=\"https://recruiters.wtf\"&gt;Recruiters, WTF?&lt;/a&gt; You select whether you want to label, archive or delete the emails from recruiters and it generates a filter that you can import into GMail, ta-da! Now it&amp;#39;s easier to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;m resubmitting this because reddit blocked my account and I just got it unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
