  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We built a slack app to solve a simple problem: Managing capacity in a hybrid office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We figured companies would downsize their office space and most would have less desks available than number of people in the team. So managing capacity in a hybrid-work setting would become an issue, primarily for office managers. Managing this with spreadsheets, forms, emails etc would be inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also thought that for small companies this problem will exist, but will not be big enough to start using / paying for a dedicated piece of software. So we thought Slack would be the best place to solve this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We built something really simple. An office user can&lt;br/&gt;\n- Book a day in the office,&lt;br/&gt;\n- See who will be in the office,&lt;br/&gt;\n- Cancel a booking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An office manager can&lt;br/&gt;\n- create a space (a space for an office, or multiple spaces if they want to breakdown the office),&lt;br/&gt;\n- set a capacity per space,&lt;br/&gt;\n- see some analytics and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a look here: &lt;a href=\"https://bukadesk.com/\"&gt;https://bukadesk.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would be willing to offer some guidance;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does the problem resonate with you? Have you been in a situation where you need to book a space to go to the office?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Any input / feedback you could offer to improve the service?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
