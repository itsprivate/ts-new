It is easy to document that almost all major improvements in our lives built through new knowledge have some of their roots in research. Reading papers can take anywhere from 30 mins to 1 hour and that is if you have a background in the subject - otherwise it could go up to 6 hours trying to understand the technical jargon. A lot of these research papers are funded by the government - ie. it is public tax money yet it’s the same people who paid for this that are the least likely to get access to it. So, in our startup, we&amp;#39;re taking key insights from top research articles and present them in digestible summaries. On top of it, we include an annotation layer that will flag up difficult jargon, get definitions, images and videos from the internet and show them in the margins. We want to build an experience like reading &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; for school, where the tough words are explained for you as you read. Now, the issue I&amp;#39;m trying to solve is where do I market this? Instagram? Twitter? I&amp;#39;m trying to target researchers, students, journalists, enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can check out the website here - &lt;a href=\"https://out-read.com\"&gt;out-read.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
