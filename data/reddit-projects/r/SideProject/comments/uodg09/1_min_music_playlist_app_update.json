The algorithm learns and selects the best (10-20 second) parts of audio-based media content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like I can email over a sample 1 minute playlist (just provide your favorite genre) using the shortening algorithm to test out. I can send the app when we are about to launch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sign up for the waitlist below if you are interested and I&amp;#39;d love any comments/criticisms on designs :)&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://forms.gle/W7BxeY1s39andTPB7\"&gt;https://forms.gle/W7BxeY1s39andTPB7&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ximqobtaj4z81.png?width=796&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7d115abb61aacc89be94e11aaa6e85463eddb4ce\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ximqobtaj4z81.png?width=796&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7d115abb61aacc89be94e11aaa6e85463eddb4ce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
