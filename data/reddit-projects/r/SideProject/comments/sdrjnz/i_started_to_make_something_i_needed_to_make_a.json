  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years I&amp;#39;ve been printing out papers with a weekly table format, writing out my tasks for the week in a semi-structured manor. I tried using digital platforms, but they never gave me the exact layout I wanted (looking at you Google cal). I tried recreating things in editor type platforms like Notion, but I&amp;#39;d always find myself spending more time trying to set it up and manage its design than doing any actual planning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After not finding any major alternatives to do what I wanted, I decided to just build it myself. I laid out some basic requirements, and used a ui framework to prototype quickly. Found a good name with a .com ending, and alas began the development of &lt;a href=\"https://www.weekliner.com\"&gt;www.weekliner.com&lt;/a&gt; (screenshot below)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1r0mmw5k66e81.png?width=2936&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7ab0e628a5faa3f51bc845d7bf1e01d1709d5875\"&gt;Screenshot of weekliner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The app is still quite limited in functionality (you can&amp;#39;t even sign up yet), but after asking some friends around I realized something like this could potentially help a lot of people get things organized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My vision:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a simple no frills weekly planner to get organized&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;an unstructured/time based view of tasks for each day (meaning you can plan out along a schedule from top to bottom, or create tasks that can later be sorted/filtered by whatever you want - priority, type, A-Z)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the ability to add weekly goals, monthly goals (maybe), and just high level goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a day/week/month view - on a day view, for example, there&amp;#39;ll be another spot for just taking notes about the day (maybe I can make this a full blown weekly planner/diary - who knows?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case, wanted to share and ask what you guys think. Always open for feedback, and if this is something that could help you let me know if there&amp;#39;s any feature you&amp;#39;d want on something like this!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
