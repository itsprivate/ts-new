Fixed and tested everything and tripled my open rates to 65-80%.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a side-project I decided to build a free checklist and toolkit for others to follow. I suspect I&amp;#39;m not the only one who&amp;#39;s experienced this issue. I just finished it a couple days ago and would love some feedback &amp;amp; reviews from the community. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goal is to reduce complexity as much as possible and I think I&amp;#39;ve done that to a certain degree but there&amp;#39;s still work to be done especially for people who aren&amp;#39;t as technically savvy.  Which is why I think there&amp;#39;s maybe a business here, but for now I want to listen to you guys and determine if there is a big enough a pain point to build a product or service around.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Questions I have for you:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is low email deliverability and low open rates an issue for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If yes, did the checklist help you? If not, why? Where did you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you be willing to pay to for someone to set it up for you? If yes, how much? If not, why? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure I made some typo&amp;#39;s or mistakes along the way so feel free to try out the checklist and report anything that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense or should be changed. Your feedback is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
