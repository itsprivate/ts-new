All founders, entrepreneurs, VC keep an eye on it to see what are the new trends. So, having a product that hits the top #5  of the day will bring you thousands of visits, some attention from all over the world, and even some PR. Product Hunt is THE place to get your early traction. Here is a guide of how to get more out of your launch. <em>It is an extract of</em> <a href=\"https://userbooster.co/\"><em>UserBooster</em></a><em>, a Notion Dashboard that helps you get your first users and build your launch strategy.</em></p>\n\n<h1>When to launch on PH</h1>\n\n<p>The bad news about Product hunt is: you only have one shot. You can‚Äôt post the same product twice, except if you made some major upgrade. So you better get a good launch! That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt advise you to launch fast on PH. My advice here is to wait until you get your first feedback and a  small audience.</p>\n\n<h1>Build Followers</h1>\n\n<p>First,  build an audience (use the other acquisition channel on this dashboard to do it). You will need a couple of hundreds of upvotes to hit the front page, so grow a mailing list of at least 500+ followers (or any other sort of audience, like Twitter). If you start from scratch, I  highly recommend using the ‚ÄúShip‚Äù feature of ProductHunt. Creating a  following base directly on PH is much more actionable when you launch!  In the meantime, start some conversation in the Discussion section of  PH. As always, try to bring value to your topic. It should give you some followers as well. Connect all your social media to PH. That way, all your Twitter, FB friends will see your PH profile and will follow you!</p>\n\n<h1>Build a good product</h1>\n\n<p>That sounds obvious, but if you want to get all these upvotes, you better have a good product!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Iterate on your product as much as you can. Use the feedback you got from your early users to build the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù product.</li>\n<li>Work on the UI/UX. You‚Äôll be spawned in a list with plenty of other projects. You better stand out!</li>\n<li>Create some growth/retention strategy. You will have tons of visits during the launch day. Be sure to have a way to transform all this traffic into conversion.</li>\n<li>You‚Äôll receive a massive spike of traffic on launch day, so be prepared!</li>\n<li>Get some testimonials/social proof before launch. That will help for conversion!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>How to postTiming</h1>\n\n<h3>1.1 Hours</h3>\n\n<p>Product  Hunt launches are all about timing! The homepage is reset every day at  12 am PST. So schedule your post just after 12 am PST, that way, you‚Äôll have 24hrs of exposure. It‚Äôs also a good way to get some traction before the big guys from Silicon Valley! When scheduling your post, set the time zone to PST. Product Hunt does not adjust for different time zones.</p>\n\n<h3>1.2 Days</h3>\n\n<p>If you want maximum exposure and traffic, you should launch on  Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday. They also are the most competitive days -  launch there only if you‚Äôre fully prepared! Tip: use weekends for your  small projects, you‚Äôll get less traffic, but your chance to be ranked  are better</p>\n\n<h1>Catchy listing</h1>\n\n<h3>1.1 Title</h3>\n\n<p>This one is easy. Just use the name of your product, no emojis</p>\n\n<h3>1.2 Logo &amp; tagline</h3>\n\n<p>The  logo is a 240x240 image, and that‚Äôs what attracts visitors! Use a  high-contrast logo to stand out easily. Don‚Äôt overthink it. Use Canva  and make a simple one. The GIF is not really a thing nowadays, as they  don‚Äôt auto-play. The tagline is also essential. Create several versions.  Pick the more impactful</p>\n\n<h3>1.3 Slides or Video</h3>\n\n<p>Two missions here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the world your product‚Äôs purpose</li>\n<li>Show your product and convince visitors that they want to know more (and upvote/comment)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You  should really spend some time on the slide, not really on the design  (again, use Canva), but on the content. Explain what problem you‚Äôre  solving and how it will help your customers be faster/cheaper/‚Ä¶ If  you‚Äôre comfortable with video, do it, I really think it is worth it.  Loom is probably the best way to go here. Create a short screencast to  show your solution</p>\n\n<h3>1.4 Maker‚Äôs comment</h3>\n\n<p>Your first comment as a maker is super important. It should contain</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What‚Äôs the problem you‚Äôre solving</li>\n<li>How you‚Äôre solving it</li>\n<li>Who  can benefit from it Try to add something that leads to engagement on  your comment, like a question. The more comment you‚Äôll get, the more  product hunt will promote you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>1.5 Discount (optional)</h3>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs  not mandatory, but the ProductHunt community appreciates it when you  create a special discount for the launch. I personally created a 20%  discount for 48hrs after the launch.</p>\n\n<h1>Launch Day</h1>\n\n<p>The first hours are crucial. The US is still sleeping. That‚Äôs when you need to stand out quickly!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>GOAL: hit the homepage asap</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To do that, you‚Äôll need as many upvotes/comments as you can in the first 3-4 hours!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Contact all your UE/Asian-based contacts and share your launch!</li>\n<li>Post on FB groups, Slack channels, etc</li>\n<li>Post here as well!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Interact as much as you can!</h1>\n\n<p>Answer  to EVERY comment on product hunt and on every platform you posted on,  every DM you have as fast as you can. Start discussions! I got 80+  comments on UserBooster launch, which clearly helped me to rank faster.</p>\n\n<h1>Don‚Äôt be spammy!</h1>\n\n<p>People  will support you when you launch, don‚Äôt spam people asking for upvotes.  Don‚Äôt ask people to create new accounts, or your product can be banned!  Try to get some real engagement instead, answer questions, start  conversations. If you‚Äôre not on the homepage after an hour (despite  having more upvotes/comments than your competitors), contact the PH team  on Twitter! It happened to me, UserBooster was stuck in the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù  section. I messaged ProductHunt and they fixed the issue within 10  minutes!</p>\n\n<h1>¬†After the Launch</h1>\n\n<p>A  launch on product Hunt will bring you some traffic for at least a week  after the D-Day! You‚Äôll receive some comments on your page, some  questions on social media, a lot of new connections as well - and maybe  some PR requests.</p>\n\n<h1>Don‚Äôt forget to answer them!</h1>\n\n<p>And use this launch to grow your audience and reputation online!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Share your experience/insights/results with your audience</li>\n<li>Look for PH collections website, ask for an update</li>\n<li>Put a nice PH badge on your website</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Bonus point: the PH newsletters</h1>\n\n<p>If you‚Äôre ranked enough, your product will be in the Daily and weekly newsletter. Each newsletter brought me 1000+ visitors!</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Now  you know everything about launching on Product Hunt. I used these  techniques to launch my products, that‚Äôs I managed to be ranked in the  top products on the day! I hope you the best for your launches! üöÄüöÄ If  you have any questions or suggestions, I‚Äôd be happy to talk to you about  Product Hunt, your launch, or anything else.</p>\n\n<p>Contact me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angezanetti\">https://twitter.com/angezanetti</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
