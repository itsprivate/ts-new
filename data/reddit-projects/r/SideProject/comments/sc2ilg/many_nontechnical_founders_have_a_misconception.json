However, most of them think that building software costs nothing and expect someone to do it for free or at a very little cost that can&amp;#39;t be justified. You don&amp;#39;t ask a commercial building developer to build a building for your business for free. Just like that you shouldn&amp;#39;t expect a software developer to build your software business for free. If you are not willing to invest yourself in your business, no-one else will invest in it, since it shows that you are not sure enough to put your own money in. I help some startups at an early stage with low cost development in anticipation of getting longer term work contracts once the startup succeeds, but I won&amp;#39;t be able to do it completely free as many expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
