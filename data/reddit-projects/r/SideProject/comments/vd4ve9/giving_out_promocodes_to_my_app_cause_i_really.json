I want to own apps, not rent them, and I want to have all the functionality immediately and forever. So I made &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finale-to-do/id1622931101\"&gt;my own to do app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, its not at the level of more established apps, but its powerful enough to be useful on a daily basis and personally covers all the needs I have: tasks, lists, multiple reminders, customization, widgets, themes, different icons, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The app is also built around simple gamification - when completing tasks users gain points, level up, unlock perks, and earn achievements. This way I hope to make it more motivating and engaging to do simple chores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to get feedback from people like me who want to get things done. I added some promo codes for you guys in the comments, so any feedback is welcome! Rip the app apart and let me know how I can make it better. (only ios for now, sorry android fans)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
