  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all,</p>\n\n<h1>TL:DR</h1>\n\n<p>I published a free &amp; ad-free Flutter app named Scored! for Android and Web. You can find the apk on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.tteo.scored\">Google Play</a>, the Web app <a href=\"https://scored.gitlab.io/#/\">here</a> and the sources on <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/scored/scored.gitlab.io\">Gitlab</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Long version</h1>\n\n<p>Years ago (in 2016!), I published my very first Android app, Scored!, made in Java then rewritten in Kotlin.</p>\n\n<p>A few years later, I discovered Flutter and decided to update my app and rewrite everything in Flutter! At that point, I still had never advertised it outside of a few friends. </p>\n\n<p>A couple more years later (a couple months back), I decided to upgrade to Flutter 2 and rewrote everything once again (because the whole flow and design is different from the previous version). </p>\n\n<p>And now, I&#39;m trying to advertise it a bit! (I&#39;m not advertising it to make money, it&#39;s a free and ad-free app, I would just like to see other people using my app :) ) </p>\n\n<p>The app is meant to be a simple way to keep count of anything. I mostly made it because I used to play board games a lot and a lot of those don&#39;t really have a way to keep track of the scores. Even though that was the base idea, Scored! can be used to keep track of anything countable. </p>\n\n<p>The first version had no history, meaning you&#39;d lose everything once you closed the app. For the v2, I wanted to have an easy way to access my previous games, which was then added to the app as the main screen.</p>\n\n<h1>Additional info for the devs</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The app is written in <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/\">Flutter</a></li>\n<li>I&#39;m using <a href=\"https://github.com/hivedb/hive\">HiveDB</a> for the history part, I thought I&#39;d use SQLite, but I decided to try something I didn&#39;t know (and don&#39;t use at work)</li>\n<li>I&#39;m also using <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/provider\">Provider</a> to handle the language and dark mode toggles</li>\n<li>I&#39;m deploying on web using Gitlab CI and on the PlayStore using <a href=\"https://fastlane.tools/\">Fastlane</a></li>\n<li>The app has been tested on macOS and would probably also work on windows, linux and iOS, even though the design is made using Material Design widgets. But I don&#39;t build those version. (Because I don&#39;t have an Apple developer license, nor a windows/linux computer to build on)</li>\n<li>Everything is on the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/scored/scored.gitlab.io\">Gitlab repository</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;m interested in any question, suggestion, remark,... you might have 👍</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks a lot to anyone who tries Scored!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
