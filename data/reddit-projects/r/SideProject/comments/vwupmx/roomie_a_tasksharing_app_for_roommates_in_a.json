  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I built a full-stack app: &lt;a href=\"https://roomiee.netlify.app/home\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roomie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to manage housework for roommates in a shared apartment. The app allows users to create tasks and assign them to apartment members. Then, from the calendar, every user can view what all members need to do in the selected week. Here is the short demo of this minimal app:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/vwupmx/video/ynq7yxzf70b91/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/vwupmx/video/ynq7yxzf70b91/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/vwupmx/video/xplslu6oa0b91/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/vwupmx/video/xplslu6oa0b91/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A task will last for one week. During the assigned week, an assignee can choose any time to complete it. Besides, users can set task frequency. If &lt;code&gt;task.frequency === 1&lt;/code&gt;, then it needs getting done every week. If &lt;code&gt;task.frequency === 3&lt;/code&gt;, it needs getting done once every three weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My roommate and I use this app for 8 months and find it helpful. At first, I wrote it just for my usage, so the app is very minimalistic. As I get more experience, I would like to rewrite it to be more professional with more appropriate features. But, before that, I need to gather feedback from other Redditors. Do you think this idea can benefit your life in a shared apartment? Which features do you want to add or change? Text me or comment if you want to create an open-source project together based on this idea.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading !!!
