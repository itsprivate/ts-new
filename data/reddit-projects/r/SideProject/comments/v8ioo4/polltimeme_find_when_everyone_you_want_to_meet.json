I wanted to share this free to use project I&amp;#39;ve been working on over the past few weekends called PollTime.me (please excuse the fact the name sounds like an exotic dancer request app!)  So PollTime came from a place of necessity for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After spending hours trying to get team members, clients and leads to get together for a Zoom call I wondered if there was anything easier than going back and forth to try and find a time that suited everyone. That was the start of PollTime.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know there are similar tools out there such as Outlook&amp;#39;s FindTime but as someone who doesn&amp;#39;t use Microsoft mail services I could only find tools that kind-of fit the brief.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love your feedback on PollTime, this is a new project and I&amp;#39;ve been using it for the past few months now and it&amp;#39;s working great for streamlining my meeting requests, I&amp;#39;d love to know if it aids yours!  Any thoughts, comments or critiques welcome!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
