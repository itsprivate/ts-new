  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notion and Airtable are two favorite tools for most people here. Anyone building products around these two niches excite me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was connected with Andy building DataFetcher for some time on Twitter but never got into conversation with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I started &lt;a href=\"https://founderbeats.com\"&gt;Founder Beats - Founder Insights&lt;/a&gt;, Andy is one of the people who I have in mind to get on an interview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every IndieHacker has a strong story to share and I wanted to bring that story out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some interesting notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long did it take you to acquire your first 50 customers, and what was your growth strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took about six months to reach the first 50 customers. Initially, I launched on forums, Product Hunt, Reddit etc. which got a handful of users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being early to a marketplace like Airtable means you get a handful of new users each day, even without doing any marketing. I think a big factor in converting these people was choosing a freemium pricing model. Some people would try Data Fetcher out on the free plan for months, then finally convert when they had a concrete use case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months in, I realised Data Fetcher wasn&amp;#39;t going to grow properly unless I found a more scalable marketing channel. As for many bootstrapped products, this turned out to be SEO. Specifically, I would take common Data Fetcher use cases and create YouTube videos &amp;amp; written tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, 30%-40% of my customers come through our YouTube videos or blog posts, and this % has steadily increased. The interesting thing is the number of views on the videos/ blog posts is tiny (e.g. &amp;lt;1000 total views for most videos), but the intent is super high, so the conversion rate is high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which technology stack are you using and what challenges and limitations does it pose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The backend is written in Node.js, TypeScript, PostgresQL, GraphQL and hosted on Heroku. The frontend is React.js, TypeScript and Airtable&amp;#39;s Blocks SDK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I chose this stack because I was already familiar with it, which is the approach I&amp;#39;d advise anyone to take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There haven&amp;#39;t been any serious limitations, but there have certainly been some Heroku growing pains, now that Data Fetcher users are doing 10,000s of runs (an import/export) per day. I&amp;#39;ve had to upgrade Heroku servers/ database in a hurry and add lots of monitoring to try and see this coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The backend relies on Airtable&amp;#39;s REST API. It&amp;#39;s solid enough but has some quirks I&amp;#39;ve had to build around. e.g. it uses names for tables rather than ids, which means when a user changes a table name their scheduled runs start failing. So gracious error handling and alerting the user has been very important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More founder insights around building profitable Micro SaaS around Airtable from Andy &lt;a href=\"https://founderbeats.com/andy-cloke-shares-how-he-grew-data-fetcher---a-no-code-tool-for-airtable---to-8600-mrr\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
