So I decided to complete my product to be able to earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://Mentionlist.com\"&gt;Mentionlist.com&lt;/a&gt; helps track mentions on reddit, twitter and facebook. This is a very good way to get new customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also promote this project in the same way. For example, I monitor the keyword &amp;quot;How to find beta users&amp;quot; and then, based on the results, I leave a response with an offer to try my product to get beta testers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a good way to promote your product, as you are solving a person&amp;#39;s pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The project is still far from perfect, there is work to be done, but the basic functionality is already there and it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, I will gladly answer them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
