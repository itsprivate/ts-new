You SHOULD NOT outsource sales to some external agency or by hiring a salesperson. Doing sales on your own both teaches you how to sell and helps you understand your users/customers better. üß†&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Writing a cold email appropriately is one of the most essential skills a founder can learn while doing sales. That would be especially helpful for B2B startups, however, can be also applicable to others. üìß&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Key Tips on writing a cold email right:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. It should be short. Max 6-8 sentences&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Clear language. No jargon. No buzzwords&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Address the problem that the potential customer is having&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Say you are the founder. Describe why you/your team are impressive&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Include a link to your website/video/gif showing your solution to their problem&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Include an ask for a call/meeting / self&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;serve&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Important note‚ùóÔ∏è - &lt;strong&gt;selling to startups is a lot easier&lt;/strong&gt; than selling to small/middle-sized companies since startups are the ones who are more eager to try out new software, product, etc. as long as it solves their problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Persistence is the key. You should be ready to send out 100/200/300 cold emails before you onboard a real paying customer. It&amp;#39;s pretty clear from the picture above what the typical sales funnel looks like. &lt;strong&gt;500 emails led to 2 customers&lt;/strong&gt;. But if you had stopped on the 100th email you would have never gotten these 2 customers in the first place. Fascinating stuff!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay lean ‚úä  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.
