So much time, effort, and experience spent on building something cool with no idea of how to market, much less validate their idea, and that sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why you see so many makers rush off to Product Hunt only to be met with crickets or cross-post here on Reddit to oblivion--it&amp;#39;s hard to get a SaaS product, game or tool off the ground with no budget or plan to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After thinking on it for a while, I came up with a growth hacking plan I think that could turn a bootstrapped side project into a profitable customer-funded business. I&amp;#39;d like to offer it 100% free to the makers of &lt;a href=\"/r/sideproject\"&gt;r/sideproject&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for testimonials and case studies because ultimately, I&amp;#39;d like to turn it into a consulting business or info product down the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shoot me a chat if you&amp;#39;re interested!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
