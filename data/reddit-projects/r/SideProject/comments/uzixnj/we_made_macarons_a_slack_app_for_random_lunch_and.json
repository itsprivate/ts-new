We just wanted something easy to use and simple to set up that matches 2 or more people randomly. And, we wanted funny icebreakers. So, we collected all features we use with other apps for a while and then started with the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took us a few months (I think it was 4) but now we released &lt;a href=\"https://macarons-roulette.app\"&gt;Macarons&lt;/a&gt;. After adding Macarons to the workspace you have to invite it to a channel and then can configure how often people of that channel are matched. Additionally you can specify how big the match groups should be and everyone participating can adjust their participation rate. That&amp;#39;s basically it. Since Macarons is not over-boarded with features we also reflected this in our pricing with only $0.99 per participating user.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning so far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you want to support so called &amp;quot;enterprise workspaces&amp;quot; in Slack, the user management is pretty complicated. We did that before and documented our code, but still had a few moments where we got confused. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We use PHP/Laravel and it&amp;#39;s really a nice stack to rapidly develop web apps, no regrets here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We still have to learn so much about marketing and promotion but it&amp;#39;s a side project and side projects are good for learning 😊&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
