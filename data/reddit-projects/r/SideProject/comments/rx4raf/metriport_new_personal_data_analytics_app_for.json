You can try it for free today: &lt;a href=\"https://metriport.ai/\"&gt;https://metriport.ai/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea to build Metriport was mainly driven by our own need for such a tool. There were a bunch of existing apps for journaling, habit tracking, water intake, health device integration, spending tracking, etc, but nothing that met our requirements:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• Everything in one app: nothing would let us track whatever thing we could think of, with the data visualization, correlations, and insights to boot. Maybe a user wants to journal, but wants to track their focus rather than mood? Maybe they don&amp;#39;t care about journaling at all, but they want to see how their caffeine intake influences their resting heart rate, or anxiety levels? With Metriport, we are building a platform that&amp;#39;s as robust as possible to cover any personal data tracking needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• Customizability: we wanted an experience that&amp;#39;s personalized to us, and all other apps felt too hard-coded. If an app did have a friendly avatar, we couldn&amp;#39;t change what questions it was asking us. If an app had data visualization, we couldn&amp;#39;t change the colours or type of the chart. If an app had a mood tracker, we couldn&amp;#39;t change the name of the categories. We made sure to make customization a priority with Metriport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• No paywall spam: we noticed that many apps offered very limited functionality in the free versions, and would use manipulative paywall tactics to get any actual utility from the app. As such, we wanted to provide as useful of an experience as possible for both free and paid users. We will only be providing additional features for all users as development continues, and will never hide existing free features behind a paywall in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;• Privacy: we are privacy freaks, so we wanted full control over our data and to know how it&amp;#39;s being used. We are shocked that there are very popular journaling and habit tracking apps out there that don&amp;#39;t have a single mention of encryption, and force you to use their cloud storage by default. That&amp;#39;s kind of scary. So, we have the option for data import/export/deletion at any time, store all data locally by default with optional encrypted cloud backups/restores, and use a bare minimum amount of anonymized analytics with opt-out ability at any time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re just getting started, and are hoping to get lots of feedback from the community on what we&amp;#39;re building. As this is a highly personal tool, we want to make sure we&amp;#39;re building the best experience for every one of our customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all very much in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
