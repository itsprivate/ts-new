  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Headway is a quick morning and evening accountability journal that helps you be more productive and satisfied. The app was inspired by an executive coach named Marshall Goldsmith who was recently featured on &lt;em&gt;The Knowledge Project&lt;/em&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The evening system is taken from Marshall&amp;#39;s book Triggers (with his permission), and the morning is a combination of questions from research I&amp;#39;ve done. The result is ~4 mins/session, but the impact is huge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear what the group thinks of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS App Store:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headway-journal/id1477254209\"&gt;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headway-journal/id1477254209&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://www.getheadway.app/\"&gt;https://www.getheadway.app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marshall Goldsmith on TKP&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/marshall-goldsmith/\"&gt;https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/marshall-goldsmith/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a 7-day free trial, but shoot me a DM and I&amp;#39;ll hook up with a link to download it for free in the app store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embarrassment Confession&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is sort of a main project that took a long time and I launched in the app store but never made an official social launch (here, Product Hunt, etc) because I was a little embarrassed. I&amp;#39;m not technical, and I did a poor job managing the inexperienced dev shop I chose, which led to a late, buggy app. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dev and subsequent debugging really crushed my momentum and bruised my ego pretty good. However, after listening to Marshall&amp;#39;s interview, I realized the app and system are sound and other people might enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever produced something that&amp;#39;s near and dear to your heart, then you understand the counterintuitive nature of my embarrassment. Much to my surprise, I had friends and other smart folks I respect laugh, tell me it wasn&amp;#39;t a great idea, and often show no interest in even trying to use it. Because it was my first project (and launched right at the start of the pandemic), I took it all pretty hard and got pretty down on myself. Now that I have some distance from it, my ego isn&amp;#39;t quite so attached and I&amp;#39;d like to let this peacock fly, captain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thx,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
