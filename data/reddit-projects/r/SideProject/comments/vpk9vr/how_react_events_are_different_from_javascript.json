After some research I finally understood the difference between react events and JavaScript addeventlisteners and when to use each of them based on the use case scenario in react. Its very important to understand the concept behind each of them and how they affect your application based on performance, and how &amp;quot;pooling&amp;quot; makes react events special. This 3 minute video explains everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Link: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXR86JNulw0\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXR86JNulw0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
