I am in charge of the technical part and helping a bit with the promotion. The problem we (mostly SGP &#39;cause I&#39;m not a musician... developers gotta develop)))) are trying to solve is to change the way people think about guitar music. They should take it much more seriously and keep focus on the results they want to achieve. Not to learn how to play another guitar lick or song, but to learn how to play everything you want, the way you want.</p>\n\n<p>What do we have so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>More than 220 exercises with detailed explanations and tabs (Guitar Pro). All of them are organised by topics and will help you master some particular technical problem(s).</li>\n<li>Basic progress tracking tools (keep track of TODO/ATTEMPTED/COMPLETED lessons and your daily activity).</li>\n<li>Very beginning of the blog.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Future plans:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Audio/video mostly. As it hard to explain music using just text. SGP is obsessed with the quality, that&#39;s why it takes so long to deliver it...</li>\n<li>Add more exercises to the current topics and introduce the new ones.</li>\n<li>Keep writing blog articles (SGP has a lot to say).</li>\n<li>Keep working on the progress tracking tools as they are very basic right now (current idea is to add something like &quot;Learning Diary&quot; where you can upload your audio files and share them with other users).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is the link: <a href=\"https://learn.slowguitarplayer.com\">https://learn.slowguitarplayer.com</a></p>\n\n<p>You can use &quot;reddit&quot; (no quotes) promo code to get $10 OFF for monthly subscription.</p>\n\n<p>Some tech details for anyone who is interested :)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>FE: Node 14 + Next.js + Auth0 + Chakra UI + alphaTab</li>\n<li>BE: Python 3.9 + uWSGi + Flask + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL</li>\n<li>Infra: Ubuntu 20.04 + Ansible + Caddy + Docker</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate any feedback/questions (both business and technical) about this project. Also it would nice to hear about your experience with other guitar schools (if you&#39;ve tried any).</p>\n\n<p>I get desperate at times due to the current workload at my main job, but trying to be positive and keep pushing :)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p41sde48nbe71.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27cd89af0fc7d81fc22db1f4172c072503e378ca\">Not only a human being can be a great musician (SGP&#39;s cat) ;)</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
