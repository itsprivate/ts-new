I also have some knowledge on front end (javascript) and machine learning (not a big fan of python pandas and stuff), so I think I can handle a complete project if it isn&amp;#39;t very large. Even if I don&amp;#39;t manage to complete the project, I will make sure that the code is very clean so it&amp;#39;s easier for someone to finish it. Also, I would be able to work only 8 hours per week (more or less) since I already have 40 hours/week job here in my country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
