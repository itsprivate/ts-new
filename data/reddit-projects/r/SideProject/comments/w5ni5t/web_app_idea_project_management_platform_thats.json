After working on engineering project teams that are lead by typical engineering managers with no project management background, I&amp;#39;ve noticed a few trends (disorganization and confusion) and potential gaps in the current tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Project Management (PJM) platforms like Asana, Monday, etc. have some fantastic tools but...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#39;t really give you a good framework for when and how to use the tools and most people are not trained in managing projects.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#39;t help guide the manager with planned communication&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#39;t really have a system for generating project documentation with versioning to help track changes along the way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#39;t  have good (or any) system for keeping track of team member workload.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#39;t have a good way to archive lessons learned throughout each project&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They lack a strong visualization of baseline/task slippage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Overall they seem geared towards software development teams&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-2. Build a platform for small/med sized projects (i.e. engineers need to retool part of a factory or an IT team is installing updated network equipment throughout an office) that&amp;#39;s based on the &lt;a href=\"https://P3.Express\"&gt;P3.Express&lt;/a&gt; framework of management where it actually walks you through the process of managing the project in a gated &amp;quot;hey you&amp;#39;re at this step, create this document, communicate to stakeholders, schedule a meeting, etc...&amp;quot;, which is very useful for the large number of unofficial project managers out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2q81dluto6d91.png?width=2750&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a45069544417f8a4e1286c5810325df64d720a98\"&gt;p3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project documentation should be accessible through the UI instead of having to dig through your local file explorer to find things like your scope of work or your quotes that you got from contractors. It should have a version control system that allows the PJM to view change logs for reflection purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure how to solve this yet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create database tables for logging risks (before they occur), problems (once they occur), and lessons learned (at the project closing) so that the information can be resurfaced the next time a similar project is initiated in hopes of learning from past mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predecessor/successor task relationships should be allowed to force tasks to slip if not completed on time while showing (on a gantt chart for example) the baseline schedule for a quick visual of what is getting behind and by how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
