Btw the frontend is barebones currently, but that&amp;#39;s not the fun part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of cool PhD research on the idea, but I think we may be the only ones investigating a project of this nature currently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will be releasing a beta soon! Few problems need to be sorted out first, and currently only works with basic circuit symbols (resistors, capacitors, inductors, voltage source ... etc)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our next step is to add simulations on top, to simulate your hand drawn circuits instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One aim is to eventually get this into use in high-school curriculums as a low barrier-to-entry intro to electronics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reach out if you have any interest :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/veyzh4/video/8f03y4yvbb691/player\"&gt;Interpreting a live sketch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
