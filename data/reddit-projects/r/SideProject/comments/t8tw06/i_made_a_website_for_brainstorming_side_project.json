My biggest blocker was that I felt any new project needed to be novel and fresh. Eventually I realized that most projects don&amp;#39;t need a new idea at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good product can be made by taking an existing product and changing it to target a new audience or niche. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for me, thinking of an existing product I might want to improve on and a niche that I wanted to work with was enough to brainstorm some cool side project ideas. &lt;strong&gt;Product + customer group = idea&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;#39;s the basic idea with the above website. I hope others find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
