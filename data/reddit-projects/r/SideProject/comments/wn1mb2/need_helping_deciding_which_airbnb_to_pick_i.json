  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually spend hours laboring over which Airbnb to pick for an upcoming trip. This is a big financial decision with high amounts of risk if I pick the wrong one, so I end up reading through all the reviews to find anything even remotely negative or worrying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I created a tool to help with this process: &lt;a href=\"https://www.tripwise.me/\"&gt;https://www.tripwise.me/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xe303jdrsdh91.png?width=2339&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f49cf0ae4d4e7b4d4c416195583149a2f7b0bc91\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xe303jdrsdh91.png?width=2339&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f49cf0ae4d4e7b4d4c416195583149a2f7b0bc91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simply add in links to the Airbnbs you&amp;#39;re evaluating, and my app will display listings side by side and run NLP to analyze what specifically negative things &amp;amp; positive highlights people are saying about each listing in their reviews. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This should reduce the time spent combing through reviews manually, especially since Airbnb doesn&amp;#39;t actually allow you to filter reviews by star rating, and even if they did, almost all reviews are 5 stars anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know what features I could add that would get you to actually use this for planning your next trip! Ultimately my goal is to make something that reduces the time spent deciding on an Airbnb down from ~1 hour to &amp;lt;15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some feature requests I&amp;#39;ve collected so far:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[harder but not impossible] Enter criteria you care about (&amp;quot;has AC&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;good for kids&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;easy access to beach&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;enough real beds for N people&amp;quot;) upfront and have my site do the work of illuminating &amp;amp; finding that criteria automatically &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[easy] Display more obvious attributes such as &amp;quot;cost per bed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;number of beds&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[harder] find disagreements between what the property description says and what the reviews say&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
