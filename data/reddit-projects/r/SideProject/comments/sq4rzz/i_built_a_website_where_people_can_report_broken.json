That&amp;#39;s why I built the free and non-profit site called &lt;a href=\"https://failscout.co/\"&gt;failscout.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simple: You upload your broken products and quickly describe how long you owned them, how often you used them, and where they failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People can also suggest a fix to a broken/inconvenienced product (like a crowdsourced iFixit).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What could we do with all this data?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identifying the common failure modes of products&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collect fixes for common product failures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;See if a product&amp;#39;s quality has changed or gone down at some point&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Everything breaks eventually, but when it does, can you easily repair/fix it?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add a simple JSON API so other sites and projects can leverage our data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y7jqw3bco8h81.png?width=2134&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ab642b13d9cf32e3ceceb6204bd204d838df5f11\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/y7jqw3bco8h81.png?width=2134&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ab642b13d9cf32e3ceceb6204bd204d838df5f11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also a subreddit: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/productfails/\"&gt;r/productfails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
