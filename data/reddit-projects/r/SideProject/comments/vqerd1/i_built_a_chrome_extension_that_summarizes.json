Some months ago, I was working on a pretty boring report that consisted mainly of summarizing articles. As a good hacker, I realized that I could automate it. So I made a very simple script using GPT-3 to summarize texts. It worked well. Actually, very well! So I thought others might benefit from that too. That&amp;#39;s when I started creating a Chrome Extension to summarize texts using GPT-3. ü§ì&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any feedback is very &lt;strong&gt;appreciated&lt;/strong&gt;! Feel free to check it out at &lt;a href=\"https://getbriefly.co/\"&gt;getbriefly.co&lt;/a&gt; and don&amp;#39;t hesitate on contacting me if you have doubts or suggestions! üòä&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
