The app is intended to be like a forum social app. Lets say a mix between 9gag, and reddit. (With obviously fewer features).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The app content is divided by countries, so you can have posts from different countries, and also you can see a more general country called &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is that the app is almost not getting any downloads (like 3 per day) and more than 50% of the people that download it, uninstalls it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now most of the content, its just genrated by an automatic script, scraping some famous places (I know its not the best thing to do, but I need to have some content).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could you please have a look, tell me what you think, what would you change or any other opinion about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps:\nThe app is called Journalcy and you can download on google play:\n&lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.journalcy.news.forum.foro.metaverse.blog.community\"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.journalcy.news.forum.foro.metaverse.blog.community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: In June 2022, I made an android app called Journalcy and its not getting almost any downloads/retention. Could u give me your feedback about it:\n&lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.journalcy.news.forum.foro.metaverse.blog.community\"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.journalcy.news.forum.foro.metaverse.blog.community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
