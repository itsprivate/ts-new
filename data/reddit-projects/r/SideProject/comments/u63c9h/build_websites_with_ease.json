There&amp;#39;s tonnes of options like Shopify, etsy etc which are very generic. I&amp;#39;m targeting folks who can rely on a product to simply set a barebones website sot that they can stay laser focused on sales, marketing and businesss side of things. Here&amp;#39;s what the product currently solves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Launch  in 5 minutes, literally paste your product images and descriptions into  a Google spreadsheet and images into a folder and be done.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Painless Stripe integration, just works out the box.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clean, smooth minimal design that works.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Customize colors, titles, fonts, prices (coming soon).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No cuts from profits ever, you can make a $ or a million $, I&amp;#39;ll charge you flat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not much in terms of plugins/customizations (not for power ecommerce users).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check it out -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=\"https://pushtocreate.com\"&gt;https://pushtocreate.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel  free to comment on anything that you can add.
