I ask them how to say X word in English and they really enjoy trying to answer the correct word and I also encourage them to learn new words with each attempt. We have a great time as a family with this little game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a long time I was looking for a good idea on what to build related to this game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first thought of building an app so that they could play by themselves, earning points and levels, but I soon realized that it would be a lot of work and difficult to keep their attention. I was also concerned that this would be motivating them to use the phone more hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But last Saturday night, while we were playing, an idea came to me: build something just to support the game, some cards that will show us random words grouped by themes, that will help me keep asking them for new and old words and to play as a family. So, I built it that night!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you could also use it to teach to your children Spanish!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear your feedback:\n&lt;a href=\"https://woof-rodeo.vercel.app\"&gt;https://woof-rodeo.vercel.app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
