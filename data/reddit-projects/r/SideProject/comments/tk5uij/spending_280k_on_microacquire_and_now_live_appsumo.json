  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Fam, I am excited to share some info with yah! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;last year I spent $280k and bought a SaaS company of MicroAcquire. To some people that sounds like a LOT, to others it sounds like nothing. To me, it was HELLA expensive and scary as 💩.  If you are interested how it went down I wrote about it &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/@Spencer.Scott/spending-280k-on-microacquire-58e483b37ef4\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, in order to kick start our marketing efforts we decided to look into AppSumo. After about 6 months of back and forth we decided to move forward with an AppSumo promotion 😬. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On March 17th we went live with AppSumo. You can check out the deal &lt;a href=\"https://appsumo.com/products/median/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know what AppSumo is, it&amp;#39;s basically Groupon for SaaS companies. They negotiate insane pricing then blast that pricing out to 500k to 1 million email subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My idea behind the promotion was to put some money back in our pockets so we no longer have to bleed money into development. Its also a nice kicker that AppSumo will introduce Median to 500k to 1 million people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The team at AppSumo predicted that we would do about $200k in revenue from this promotion of which we get to keep 25% 😬. I have to be honest with yah, we are no where near being on pace to do $200k. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time of me writing this we have had 194 new companies sign up since going live (6 days). I dont know how these promotions typically go but so far the feedback has been great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, I will continue to update this post as the deal progresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers 🍻 Spencer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
