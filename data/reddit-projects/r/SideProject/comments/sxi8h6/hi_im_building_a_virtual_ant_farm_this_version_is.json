So, I am building a virtual ant farm. I found some code written in 1991 for Unix in C and figured I&amp;#39;d port it to React, bring it to the web, and begin adding some features to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the title states, this probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be live yet with the number of issues it has, but I wanted some sweet, sweet Internet-karma to keep me motivated. So, I shipped it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what it currently does:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fills a space with 2/3 dirt 1/3 air and drops 20 ants onto the dirt&amp;#39;s surface.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ants move around on tick intervals of 50ms.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ants can dig tunnels, carry sand, and drop sand.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dropped sand has some basic gravity mechanism if dropped with air beneath it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dropped sand has some basic &amp;quot;piling&amp;quot; mechanism where it will form piles on the surface rather than just columns.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Runs in the background when tab isn&amp;#39;t active and updates with what&amp;#39;s changed when visible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what it currently does not do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Save isn&amp;#39;t implemented. If you refresh or close the tab - you start over.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are some graphical glitches when ants are over holes or in the corners of the UI.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ants can get stuck in the air and &amp;quot;tumble in circles&amp;quot; rather than fall to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The UI doesn&amp;#39;t scale automatically. You&amp;#39;ll need to zoom in/out on your browser to get it appropriately sized.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ants are too small - they take up 1 square grid unit size, but should probably take up 1x2 so they&amp;#39;re larger than the dirt cubes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No visual change when an ant picks up dirt and is carrying it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Significant performance issues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No customizability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The code is bad and I feel bad.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;open source! &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/MeoMix/antfarm\"&gt;https://github.com/MeoMix/antfarm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
