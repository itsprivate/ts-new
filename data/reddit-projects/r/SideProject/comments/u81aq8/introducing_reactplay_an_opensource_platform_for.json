It is called ReactPlay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is to help developers to learn, create and share ReactJS projects with the developer community. In ReactPlay, we call each of the projects &amp;quot;Plays&amp;quot;. Any developer can be willing to start developing a play, and they are most welcome to. They can start their own or pick one from the list of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So is that all? Nope, there is more to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Each of the plays will be reviewed by the experienced React developers to give code feedback so that beginners to ReactJS learn and improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- When the play is merged, it becomes the part of the ReactPlay for the whole world to look into and understand from the source code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- If the developer got an article or a video about a play, they can associate that with the play for others to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds exciting? ü§©&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;#39;t you give it a try?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Link to the app: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reactplay.io/\"&gt;https://www.reactplay.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Link to the GitHub, Please give a ‚≠ê, if you liked the idea: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/atapas/react-play\"&gt;https://github.com/atapas/react-play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Join us on Twitter: &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReactPlayIO\"&gt;https://twitter.com/ReactPlayIO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to hearing back from you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
