Most people find it difficult to articulate their words in a way that presents themselves in a positive light, and spend countless hours on it. Hours that could be better spent applying for jobs instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My solution? Users can now select their role and get access to hundreds of examples of work experience descriptions and professional summaries to use as inspiration to write their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment, it covers 25 roles with around a total of 700 templates to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know there is a lot to improve, that is why I would love to get some feedback, thanks a lot!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/4xq4ueha5bx81.gif\"&gt;https://i.redd.it/4xq4ueha5bx81.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
