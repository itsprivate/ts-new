When I fact-checked, I found those sites were funded by controversial billionaire &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/qQbVyHVmmKs\"&gt;George Soros&lt;/a&gt; (world&amp;#39;s biggest propaganda financier). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon further investigation, I was shocked to find, some past investors of PH are closely linked to George Soror&amp;#39;s Open Society Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The propaganda and hate doesn&amp;#39;t end here, PH went overboard with endorsing a product that cuts Russia out from sites: &lt;a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/redirect-russia\"&gt;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/redirect-russia&lt;/a&gt; (in-spite of backlash in the comments and poor ratings, PH employees not only upvoted this product, but shared it on their social handles plus let it become a #3 top product of the day + newsletter placement). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best comment on the hate-mongering product was from a London-based gentleman:   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fm4scrlfnkp81.png?width=714&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2743301e58a7edc7cfdc05e348392f07cf2868e2\"&gt;London&amp;#39;s citizen raising concern over &amp;#39;PH enabling hate on Russian civilians&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rqz3g0ojnkp81.png?width=725&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4a8e5c70eb0a156f82eee613e23d603388cf4b4c\"&gt;Blocking Russia from the world strengthens Putin, says Cuba-based entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If ProductHunt continues to allow hate for Russian civilians, it will spiral into questioning US for Iraq, Afganistan, Syria, etc. Nations like UAE, India, Russia and non-NATO countries contribute to more than 50% of the  Product Hunt traffic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PH should absolutely campaign to support Ukraine, but should refrain for calling for hate on Russian civilians. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless PH has sold itself to George Soros&amp;#39; investors, &lt;strong&gt;I personally feel ProductHunt should limit it&amp;#39;s political expression and keep the platform inclusive, safe and hate-free.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe political products should be fact-checked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are already over-exposed to political news on social media, business communities like Product Hunt must stop politicizing their platform. Do you agree? What do you think? Let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
