Essentially, our algorithms screen markets during extended trading hours to provide you with real-time alert notifications for low-float stocks before they breakout or while doing so. In addition, we provide access to key research data about each stock (fundamental, technical and newsflow) to help you make fast, informed trading decisions to seize opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.edgewall.io/\"&gt;https://www.edgewall.io&lt;/a&gt;. You can sign-up for a free trial account (no need for credit card) to discover the platform! It would be great to have your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any questions and feel free to join our social channels to start the discussion and follow our updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you and kind regards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1hvcbpcadwc81.png?width=3200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9d748362081a24d8c9a207f403ed9c6a174f2e0f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/1hvcbpcadwc81.png?width=3200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9d748362081a24d8c9a207f403ed9c6a174f2e0f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
