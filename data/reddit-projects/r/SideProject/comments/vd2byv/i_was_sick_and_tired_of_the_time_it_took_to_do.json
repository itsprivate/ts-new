I&amp;#39;ve wasted so much time trying to find new prospects and emailing them, just to get a few interested people on the phone.  So I went ahead and built COSLR (coseller).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a platform that allows you to find companies in any category and the relevant contacts at the company with their contact info.  Then you can automatically email them your pitch. &lt;strong&gt;All within the platform.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use Cases:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sales Reps and BDRs looking to grow a pipeline of leads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CEOs and CFOs looking to find venture capital&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technology companies looking to sell services to new startups &lt;em&gt;(daily domain list feature)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marketers looking to run email cadences or newsletters&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve outlined all of &lt;a href=\"https://coslr.com/solutions/\"&gt;the features here&lt;/a&gt;, but COSLR does a lot!   You can research over 500M leads in the database or upload your own .CSV sheet of contacts and expand info on who you have.   There is also an API you can ping to verify the contact information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just released is a chatbot and social proof widget that you can drop on your website or landing page.  You can use the Chatbot as way to get people&amp;#39;s contact info and give them a more personalized service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please check it out and leave leave any constructive feedback.Â  I plan to continue to build COSLR out and grow it, so would love to hear where the current services can be useful for you (and any additional features you would like to see).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
