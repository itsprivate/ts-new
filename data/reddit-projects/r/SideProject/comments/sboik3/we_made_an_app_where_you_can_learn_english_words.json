We&amp;#39;ve been recently working on an app that makes it elegant easy to catch and learn unknown English words and expressions from virtually any movie or TV show in existence. Think of it as a fusion of Netflix with Duolingo, add a significantly better UX than any vocabulary teaching app on the market and spice it with a proven methodology of learning - you get Skeebdo :) The core features are based on several Reddit surveys (typically on learning languages from movies ⠀and related habits), so hope you guys like it. Would love to hear any feedback! Available for free on iOS and Android: &lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skeebdo.learn.english\"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skeebdo.learn.english&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1539896648\"&gt;https://apps.apple.com/app/id1539896648&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x200B; &lt;a href=\"https://skeebdo.com/\"&gt;https://skeebdo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
