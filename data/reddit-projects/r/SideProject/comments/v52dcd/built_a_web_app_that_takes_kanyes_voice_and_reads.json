I&amp;#39;m a bootcamp coder and built this project to learn TypeScript. I call on a Bible Api and Uberduck Api to generate audio of bible verses in the voice of Kanye. I did have to use a proxy as I was having CORS issues with Vercel and Uberduck. Also, I noticed that the audio element has a slight delay when it loads and plays for mobile. I will eventually build a backend/server for this as the loading times do take a while to generate the audio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;m a fan of Kanye and thought this project was a lot of fun. Hope it brings you some laughs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feedback is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
