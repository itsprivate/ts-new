Since Covid, it has even increased and my back showed the first signs. I felt it was time to do something about my posture. By accident, I came across the idea to use a webcam and TensorFlow to detect one&amp;#39;s posture. And so &lt;a href=\"https://www.tuara.io/\"&gt;https://www.tuara.io/&lt;/a&gt; was born. It&amp;#39;s a very early version, but valuable enough already I hope to help anybody sit better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to your feedback either here or on the site in the form. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
