It basically tells me what stops I should go to in what order to ensure that I’m spending the least amount of &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gas&lt;/strong&gt; on the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also looking into what features I can add to help the average traveler like me. Let me know if you have any ideas/feedback😁&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far its been super useful for me and thought you all would like it too, check it out here - &lt;a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/routora-google-maps-route/jdddfnfohdeaklgkpglonlofgapjgfbp?hl=en&amp;amp;authuser=0\"&gt;Google Maps Route Optimization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
