I conquered my fear and received a positive result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My co-founder and I are applying to y combinator with our startup, Typogram. The y combinator application asks for an unscripted founder intro video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually, my co-founder and I would write a short script outlining what we would say, memorize it, and recite it for the video. Although we have gotten feedback that it was robotic - we stayed with our recording method. It was easier and felt comfortable. We were worried we would look silly, blank out on words, and not be coherent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time around, we decide to challenge ourselves and try creating the video unscripted. To my surprise, the video took a shorter time to record, and I think it was more natural than the previously scripted one. I haven’t uploaded the video yet, but as far as I can tell, we sounded better and more human this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So conclusion and lesson here: don’t be afraid to venture out of my comfort zone into unfamiliar territory. You may be closer to the finish line than you previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this post, I also write a newsletter sharing my journey of building my startup. &lt;a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/\"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/a&gt; if you feel like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
