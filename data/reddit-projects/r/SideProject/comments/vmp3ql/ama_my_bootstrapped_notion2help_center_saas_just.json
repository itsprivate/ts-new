That is over 130 paying customers. From small ambitious content creators to publicly traded companies are all now using &lt;a href=\"https://www.helpkit.so\"&gt;HelpKit&lt;/a&gt; and Notion to serve their knowledge bases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is huge because it basically allows me to go full-time on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sobedominik/status/1537109753725390849\"&gt;indiehacking&lt;/a&gt; while still being in school (I&amp;#39;m 24 doing a postgrad ). My goal for this summer was to reach $1K for ramen profitability and now reaching 3x is genuinely incredible and I am incredibly grateful for the experience so far. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working on HelpKit and my other products has taught me more things than any $MBA could ever do. From being extremely nervous about doing the first few customer meetings to now confidently have handled 100+ calls â€“ some even with FAANG. I got much better at backend/DevOps, pricing, marketing, incorporation, international taxes and also handling obnoxious customer tickets. I have received (and turned down ðŸ˜‰) a handful of acquisition offers and even had people reaching out asking to work for my company (ðŸ¤¯).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions â€“ &lt;strong&gt;AMA&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
