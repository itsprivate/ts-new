  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many years of freelancing, I realized that the hardest and most time-consuming task is prospecting and lead generation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course there are many tools and strategies to generate leads, but most of them help you generate cold leads that aren&amp;#39;t always interested in your services as a freelancer or agency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day I have had enough, and started looking for a solution. I searched a bit on the web and I found different strategies that could work for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I selected three strategies and started exploring and testing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first idea is to search and apply for Requests For Proposals (RFPs); it&amp;#39;s a business document that announces a project, describes it, and solicits bids from qualified contractors to complete it.\nThe second one is to look for startups that have recently raised funding and pitch my services to them.\nThe last idea is to look for companies that have an open job position and try to convince them that working with me as a contractor is better for their business.\nYou may ask why those three strategies would work for me, right ? It&amp;#39;s simple, I don&amp;#39;t want to waste time with cold leads because at the end of the day I&amp;#39;m not sure that they need my services, so I need to spend my time only with warm leads that are 100% looking for someone like me. This approach will significantly increase my chances of closing more clients.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And guess what ? It actually works. I spent less time and I closed more clients.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, but how and where do you find them ? You just need to know how and where to search, on job boards, search engines, social media... with the right keywords and filters. Then you need to carefully read every RFP, job position, and startup news.. Then you select those that match your criteria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&amp;#39;t find any tool that does that for me in an effective way, so I decided to do it manually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And recently I decided to launch weekleads.com, a service that helps other freelancers/agencies to get access to a new list of this type of leads each week via email so they can concentrate on their billable work instead of prospecting for hours or days!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
