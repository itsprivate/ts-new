As a proof-of-concept I&amp;#39;ve built a site that shows images posted to Reddit &lt;em&gt;sort of in real time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a SPA built with Vue.js and deployed to Vercel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, the result turned out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;very very NSFW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Reddit is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; full of adult content and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried to contain it to allow for the original purpose of getting a feeling of what sort of media gets posted here by censoring NSFW-tagged content by default. But even then lots of images are not well tagged, so &lt;strong&gt;assume you&amp;#39;ll be seeing lots of nudity if you try it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that that&amp;#39;s clear, you can check it out at &lt;a href=\"https://reddstream.com\"&gt;https://reddstream.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I ended embracing it and It even has a NSFW-only mode for your... &lt;em&gt;viewing pleasure&lt;/em&gt;, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to monetize it I&amp;#39;ve added ads, really unobtrusive text ones, and I don&amp;#39;t expect much at all, but hey, who knows! If you don&amp;#39;t want them, just use any ad blocker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
