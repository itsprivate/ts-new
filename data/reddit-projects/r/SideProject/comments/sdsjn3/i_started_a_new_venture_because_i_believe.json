Two weeks ago or so, I &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/s0dukf/tinder_for_professional_networking/\"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; here asking for feedback about &amp;quot;Tinder for professionals&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you gave amazing input. I began researching a lot and found out that LinkedIn is the only recognized global player. There are copycats, but my goal would never be to build something as boring (IMO) as LinkedIn. I want to create something different, targeted towards a younger generation. TL;DR - &lt;strong&gt;I want to build something cool&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started working on the project with my friend around the same time I posted (just designing some app screens and researching WebRTC), and yesterday I launched &lt;a href=\"https://bond.so\"&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating the website took me roughly 15 minutes (no-code, completely free - using Notion, Popsy, and Google Forms). It&amp;#39;s far from perfect, but I think it does the job, and I can continuously iterate on it later when needed.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please go check it out and let me know what you think. Also, I kindly ask you to provide as much feedback as you can. We&amp;#39;re still very early, so we&amp;#39;re open to any feature ideas that might make the product better for YOU to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case you missed the link before: &lt;a href=\"https://bond.so\"&gt;bond.so&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.: I intend to keep posting about major milestones to &lt;a href=\"/r/SideProject\"&gt;r/SideProject&lt;/a&gt;, but we&amp;#39;ll probably also create some sort of blog section on our website :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
